review
The game was good but sadly runs very poorly on older devices making it almost unplayable.
"Account linking when? If there is a reason NA can't have it early, if we can ever have it, we need to know. Lasengle needs to put out a statement. They won't though since their community interaction/PR consists of scheduled social media posts, YouTube premieres which consistently show how ridiculously small their promotional budget is, and the occasional rushed livestream the two or three times a year they happen to have a panel at a Convention. I won't hold my breath."
I played for a day then it stopped working. it just shows a black screen after start up.
Played this a while back and already built a lot of heroes and also got very lucky with pulls. Wanted to play again but the problem is the account linking! It's been years and they still don't have any means of logging in other than using a one-time code (which I sadly lost)... months of grinding wasted...
"First things first, I've been playing this game for a good 7? 6? years now and this has arguably the worst Qol and Gacha in all of Gaming. Through those years, Azur Lane has changed its UI, implement tons and tons of Qol and revamped so many gameplay things. FGO? Its still the same since I was in Senior High. Literally the only stuff that changed are for the Whales with USOs. All in all, this is an EXTREMELY HORRIBLE gacha game with the worst Pitt system in all of the other competitors."
"Gudako!! üôÄüôÄ (Edited: Okay but for real the rewards are so bad, like it's so difficult to get SQ it's like Genshin but probably worse)"
"I can't log into my account because the transfer number can only be used once, basically I just lost my 4 years old account. You guys really do everything to make our lives difficult kek"
I love the game but because of my phone it keeps crashing and I just wish I can play it on PC.
question do you think you could think about adding in a feature so that if someone completes the event story they can pick any one 4 star servant beside the temporary one from the event and they can choose whether to get a copy of the 4 star if they already have for an np boost or pick the one they don't have.
didnt get the gold berserk only 2 chloe still didnt get >:(
good game but I recently reinstalled and it seems that I lost access to my old account for the game
"Got to love game makers in 2025, cause you have failed to do the data transfer through Gmail or any other means. so I couldn't remember the password I Set Up. unfortunately I will not start this game a third time. Fgo you are now a dead game to me, it was fun to play but time to move on!"
"The story is pretty decent, if a bit campy at times, especially the events, but it has its charms. Has a very anime feel, if you like that. The gatcha part is not the best part for sure, but they do a good job making almost any unit be useable, so use who you like & enjoy. returned this year to see the LB stories in full, loving that, hope it gets animated. biggest gripe is still the grinding time, truly wish there was an auto complete for nodes you beat with no deaths or use 2-3x for multiclear"
the advanced quests are quite mentally ill
don't use it
"I got Chloe so, 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
Made the wolf game in advanced quest impossible to beat. You lose characters every turn no matter what you do. 1 star for the quest you made.
"spent $300, never got the SSR I wanted. it's Gacha, I get it but I don't need this in my life anymore. thanks for the memories Fate GO."
Woah Astolfo has a whole game???!?
"The game is fine. Hopefully, they will shorten the stories they make in the future."
I loves it every burst skill animations but I hope they would make a 2nd version of fate game apps...more better and improvements gameplay and also a good graphic... I also loves the story..
lost my account because the company that has had this game running for 10 years still to this day has no way to link your account to an email. Still goes off the the code and password so I hope you never lose the code like i did. Ten years and many many many mobile games have made account interest linking a base but this one can't? I would LOVE to see their bs excuse as to why they cant.
Great story. The only problems of this game are the; First: Gacha Rate Up/Pity Second: Materials Drop Rate/Events Drop Rate
"5 star if you want an early death, 1 star if you want to live a long and happy life"
i feel sleepy after trying this game
I like this game alot but when u do 100 summons from an event and not get a single ml5 except from the 2 tickets that is almost quite worthy.
"I just lost my 5th account today and I'm very upset, please make a sync account system, I really don't want to keep losing my account."
"story is very good, highly recommend you to read it if you know the fate franchise. Also, i would like to point out that google play sometimes provides discount vouchers for ingame purchases but the minimum amount spent required is higher than any purchase FGO has. So I'd like to suggest google to provide smaller coupons or for FGO itself to provide bigger packs to solve that problem."
ts worse than a 9‚Äì5. you work and lose more often than you gain. at least its story is good sometimes
"You never learned guys, im a fan but i despised you're practice..."
"Thank you to customer support / service for helping me out & explaining in better detail what I thought I had comprehended but was ultimately wrong about even after all these years as embarrassing as it is to admit. I guess all these years I must have had great luck & when the guaranteed summon was implemented I must have hit it a few times leading me to gain a false understanding. Thank you again, I truly appreciate it. I still am docking one star for no account linking / binding yet for NA üôè"
"As a Fate fan , this is truly amazing game"
terrible account recovery
"Very fun game, interesting story and cool servant designs. My only issue as of lately is that the game keeps lagging and often freezes up and skips animations during battles especially. This used to happen only a few times in the past and I didn't mind it at first but now it's so bad I can't even get through a proper battle without having to log out of the game. Sometimes it even just kicks me out of the app itself, please help."
Worst gacha game by far. Horrible for newer players. They dont have enough resources. Boss battles take specific units to clear. Gameplay is boring. Gacha system is the greediest thing I have ever seen. Took them years to add a spark. Spark will take you a year to save up for one character that does not carry over. Play at your own risk. Game is a cash grab.
"I'm getting way too many 5 and 4 star CE and not a single Servant from Ruler Melusine banner.. huh, very suspicious.."
It still floors me how this game can make billions of dollars but they can't afford to have acct linking. I got an error message last night telling me to clear the cache in the hopes of it working again and that it wouldn't erase my game data and it turns out there was maintenance a few minutes later. Fast forward to this morning where I boot up the app to roll for Barghest and the game starts me at the tutorial. I sent in a support email but I'm still waiting to hopefully recover my account.
Terrible rates horrible for a f2p.
"I am only intereated in the story and graphics but the gacha and the resource are very hard to get, especially the gacha that you get to spend 1000 sq to get a servant you want and that is hard coz it is hard to earn sq in this game unlike the Genshin Impact that has the same gacha and hard to get resources, but they have a pity system that has guarantee 5 star roll and the FGO have no pity system. Playing for the story. Edit: The gacha is also rigged"
"Soooo disappointed after all these years, I still see no effort jn from the developers in the implementation of an account linking feature to protect peoples efforts in s√πpporting this otherwise great game. America is STILL WAITING. #1 top grossing $$$#'DFTR"
"Been playing this game for a year and it sadly does not allow USB Debugging on, but that can be solved by turning it off. Meanwhile, when the usb debugging and developers option are turned off, a software update from my phone was pushed and I updated, FGO doesn't seem to work because the automatic software update turned usb debugging on, turning it off no longer works. Please fix this."
"backed up my transfer number and pass in 2020 played till 2022. now I tried to play again (3 years later) and it somehow says my transfer number is still in use, even tho my old device, which I used to play, has been dead for 3 years without logins as the phone's broken. oof I'm just glad I didn't spent much."
"Great game, awesome graphics. But my only gripe is that you can't go back to the beginning. Stages and grind to level up not even on the characters that you haven't leveled up, forcing you to have to buy, whatever it is that they're selling so that you can upgrade your character. I think that kind of sucks. Compared to other games that give you the option to go back to the lower levels and grind your way through and upgrade your characters. If they can fix , that will be great"
"This game REVELS in wasting your time. If you're new don't even bother starting, you'll be reading story for months before you're remotely caught up and allowed to participate in events. This game extends what should be done in a minute to 10 minutes of watching the same animation and derivative dialogue over and over. Get with the time lasengle, either make a game that is worth the time spent on it or reduce the amount of time it takes to play."
"I played through all of the story content and I can say this is one of the best games I have played on Mobile in terms of story,the Gacha is mediocre but over hated (I have gotten about 18SSRs in a year fully F2P). There's not much to do other than grinding after you are done with the story. however,no one is finishing a 100+ hour story quickly.So in my opinion this game deserves a shot."
i love this game
"as a person who plays gacha games, this one was the most boring one I've played. so therefore I'm redownloading it to try it for the 3rd, but this time, I'll pay attention to the story that has zero voice acting edit: just to add, I don't like being forced to use supports and I hate how long it takes to get through the summoning animation"
love
padoru padoru~
"Worst rates in the market. Somehow have always had much, much better luck with my JP account, so something about this version feels incredibly rigged."
"Same outdated and stagnant gameplay, QoLs barely changes whatever is in, 4star servant are hard to max out unless you're a whale."
"where is my summer Skadi :""("
"Having just beaten Lostbelt (FGO2 to casuals) yes this game is actually 3 games in one. Fate/Grand Order is an incredible story where you can see and feel the protagonists grow and develop from a typical meek mage to the total badass you should be after conquering some of the crazier stakes in this game. The Gameplay may be simple but it is fun, the story(s) are what keep me coming back!"
"2500 SQ and got two 5 star Servants across two banners. I have played for 6 years and had a great time, but I don't think I can keep going."
"I don't really need to explain why I like it the fate universe is popular 
for a reason cause it has interesting back story's and twists upon history 
that make you wanna look up the real story online at least I do"
"waifus. the drop rates make getting items feel so good. the gacha rates make getting SSRs a wonderful event. I didnt get abbigail so rip 2025 update : rateup is a lie, now that my friendgroup and I are all adults they all whale but I DONT so I get no ssrs, still 5 star rating for story though"
"game is trash, the gacha is trash, good luck"
"Fate/Grand Order is a game that I overall enjoy, generally having a good story and writing (though it can absolutely depend on the chapter), great character designs, and excellent presentation. However, the game is also quite stingy with its gacha elements and the drop rates on items, and the game's difficulty definitely ramps up after a while, making it feel like you have to roll for new servants or spend a ton of time grinding for materials. but atalante cute so"
"The game is fun, and the story is great with a wide variety of characters. Combat is turn-based and very simple. Events are too dedicated however and feel too gridny compared to older events of 2 years ago. Also lack of pity system is a negative."
"No se que es m√°s absurdo, que las probabilidades de que te toque un personaje de 5 estrellas sean casi nulas, o que lleve casi los mil d√≠as en este juego, en fin, bombardeen Per√∫ üëçüèª"
"Fate has a fantastic story, and I love how master and Mash relationship is so good, and yes, it has problems, but hopefully, they give us players a quality of life by letting us sign into our Google account so we don't fear of losing our account"
more Reward 300SQ pls
"great game overall, great story and character design."
it's fine I guess
it takes way too long to download I mean why
The account system is ancient and can result in an easy account loss. The level system is slow when it only goes by a certain number of experience materials at a time. there is no quality of life features for the mindless repetitive grinding
wood Block classicmode
it's okay but the data is bad
mid lol
the beast gacha game fate series is beautiful
This game made me fell in love with history
game is broken. it doesn't load after playing after a day.
"add google acc linking, then I give 5 stars"
"this game is extremely outdated and refuses to fix anything. their ""pity"" is a joke, 330 roles for 1 of 2+ select 3+‚≠ê characters is laughable. the fact their UI is so OLD and hasn't changed in years. their recent anniversary event is a joke of spend 40$ for maybe a character you will like. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON ACCOUNT RECOVERY. how is an 8yr+ old game not using ANY form of account recovery? fans need to stop supporting their bad and toxic practices. this game is bad and doesn't care."
Very fun simple yet deep pixel art is awesome. Behind the times gacha pools now that other gacha games separate the equipment and the characters. Finally has a pity system. Advanced Quest system is so poorly designed they have to bribe players to clear it.
I think it's changed over the years and they have made it more user friendly with giving out heroes. The odds are still frustrating for how many resources are given out but they always add more content and the characters are all really well made.
Since the game likes to give me 3 stars I feel it's only fair
After playing the game since release I want to give a new review. I am still giving it a one star why you ask? well 1. I tried to recover my data after my phone was stolen and the recovery team never helped me get it which was stupid. 2. My friend gave me his extra account which now I devoted my self to put some money like I did with my old data. My conclusion game is good but recovery team is terrible and I hope to never loose this data.
You took my account from me and I will do everything in my power to take what you love too. Look out for me because I will find every one of you and I will not stop until you all come face to face with the Artoria you took from me.
1200 rolls and just 2 rate up ssr. hah.
"just don't play this stupid game at all, developers are scamming you out of your money and they only want one thing from you which is money. this game is horribly pay to win. you need to sacrifice 10 cows to get a single 5 star unit, and even that is not enough. you have a higher chance of getting hit by a lightning bolt than get a 5 star from this game. and don't bother contacting support they only listen to you if you have money"
been playing for years now
this was the greatess game i ever play
"Game has always had the potential to be great. Yet it never will be due to greed and players who fall victim to it. Outdated UI and terrible UX for this day and age and no sign of them ever planning to update it. Pity system is beyond ridiculous. Considering you even have the potential to lose your account randomly without recovery. so, a warning, if you play this game, then it should be purely to pass the time‚Äîspend your own cash wisely, you could easily lose it all."
"Seriously Devs, it's been TEN YEARS now and we still don't have a way to permanently bind our account that isn't through this horrible code system, PLEASE Aniplex or anyone in the higher up chain, ADD THE BINDING ACCOUNT FEATURES TO ALL SERVERS! Stop catering only to ASIA SERVERS!"
"The currency used for pulling has two versions: free and paid. Most banners require the paid version. This is more comparable to Raid Shadow Legends than to a typical modern gacha game, and it's kind of disgusting. Less important but somewhat notable, the art style is all over the place, with many character designs resembling a 13-year-old's deviantArt OC. I give FGO two stars because it's still leagues better than the average mobile game."
"the game is good for me, but is quite a hassle to find material when i don't know where it can be farmed. maybe a way to tell you where you can find the material or in the story or in the daily quest"
(Edit) Epic Storytelling that kept me here for years. still engaging enough even after so long
I love Douji
"I'm done with this game. You are the worst gacha devs of all time. You give us 100 SQ, I summon, I get the same copies of two 4 star characters I already have and a 5 star CE. I don't care about the story anymore. I hope Hoyoverse buys this franchise, at least they'd give better treatment to this game and its players. There haven't been any improvements to the 5 star drop rates, it's impossible to reach pity as F2P, and the menus are still ugly and boring. Not recommended."
what the heck? I bought a in app purchase that said $0.00 and it charged over $80.00 to my account! how do I fix this? this was a scam!!
Returner and I forgot how hostile this was to people who aren't paying attention to account details. To everyone new and old please for the love of god write it down somewhere.
boss fights every trun he has 3 charges of invincible he's stunning my party every turn he can fire off a ult that wipes my entire party and ignores evades and invincibility and he makes it were I cant get buffs these boss fights that are in STORY is like dragging my balls across glass fragments I've played for 4 years and I want to quit I'm livid cant even play 4 turns in a row I'm stunned and whole team is gone ! yay and these debuffs cant be canceled these devs are high
happy anniversary! no luck so im really happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"This is probably the only game that does not allow me to enter the game despite having a stable connection. Whenever I try to enter the game, I'm always stuck at the connecting screen for a long time before being told that the game failed to connect to the server and that I should retry or restart the app which I already did... 11 times. My other online games work, IDK what's this game's problem."
"Day 1 Player. Still salty about not pulling Skadi after 800 SQ and 55 Tickets last time. Pity System was introduced so late into the game. Not to mention, unlike other gachas, this game will lock you out of certain Limited Time Events if you aren't caught up in Part 2 and with its High Difficulty, which is bad for new players and vets who dont have the time to play. Overall, Story, Characters, Artwork is good, but not leenient if you arent playing Day 1. DO NOT LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT ALSO"
"Jul/2025: i thought this game changed after years of not playing it. still the worst gacha system in the world. 90% of meta characters locked behind fomo, roster is garbage for f2p, pity system does not exist. deleting this app again going to go play NIKKE."
I have been trying for 5 star characters and never get any. I had used all the bonuses to try and get the new 5 star character and got no 5 star characters. I swear this is bad.
Would give it more stars if they lowered the pity
THIS IS GOOD YEAAAHHH ITS GOOD
i hate this game
"The game is still fun after all these years, but can we PLEASE get a FREE auto battle? I can't bring myself to login and use all my stamina in repetitive farming day in and day out. if I can clear in 3 or even 5 waves without casualties and without the aid of friend supports, I should be able to just auto battle using my stamina. would care a lot more for this game if at least that quality of life change was made."
I hate this game becoz I don't get saber alter on her banner which makes me disappointed
EXCALIBUR!!!
"If you're fortunate enough to read this review before you get the game, don't get it. The quality is poor, drop rates are horrendous, and extremely predatory with its microtransactions (they literally separate free premium currency from paid premium currency). No event gives you any cool new free stuff. making any decent progress a slow, painful grind. The gameplay is so repetitive that you will lose interest in about a week of having the game."
"8 years of (dis)service in NA, 10 in JP and still no account binding or PC client. Constant typos. Servant C*ins. No more costumes or animation updates. Buffs slowed to a crawl. No new low rarity Servants, popular NPCs never released because they're not overdesigned waifu slop. Same old gameplay but with powercreep so bad that bosses all have invul, pierce invul, buff block x3, debuff immun, dmg cut + so much more you have to scroll, all unremovable. Forced daily engagement system (Storm Pods)."
"honestly,I installed this game cause of Astolfo :3"
"Its got a good story arc that gets better as you go. Events can be fun. Also, gatcha is hell. Pull up a seat pilgrim and pass the salt. *After trying out other games, the lack of a desktop pc app and auto battle really hurts the quality of life experience, as it takes a lot of your time to do just about anything. I have been spoiled by being able to go between my phone and pc applications and how great that is for my time in life when trying other products, and that really shows FGO's age."
Ahorre como 1 a√±o para ni si quiera conseguir el personaje que queria
I have been playing for about 1.5 years. I love the game.
"good game to play of you wanna pass time or want a lore driven story to follow, I'm just in it for the archetype earth rerun:3 wonderful customer support when dealing with account loss (if you provide them with enough information)"
why is it lag üòë
"6/2025 No Account safety-Lose Phone Lose Everything. Either way when an update is needed you can't even generate a SAFE TRANSFER CODE (to allow transfer to another device) this would be helpful. Just another Gacha/Loot Box/Gambling game that ""Auto-Updates"" Google Playstore THEN you still WAIT for the game to download its DATA. No Account system except in Japan, Extreme FOMO mainpulation tactics, No Auto-Battle, No replay Story fights, and no VA in storymode."
"Overall great game. Biggest complaint is the crashing and horrible pity system, the story is really dull at the start. When you get to Camelot, that's when the story gets really good. (And hard) Wish my phone had enough space to continue playing this game, as this ain't no small game."
Peak gaming experience.
"Bad experience. if you watch the story on auto, when your phone decides to sleep and you turn it back on in less than a second, this boots up the logo and goes on blank screen infinitely. this boots up in blank for a couple of times even if you keeps killing it in task until you Force stop this then it ask you to redownload your cache which you say no then runs fine again. Big waste of time!!! üëæ"
"This gacha is my favorite. It doesn't have as much QOL as a modern day gacha game, but they have been implementing it from time to time. I recommend only spending on GSSR and Destiny Order GSSR if you're a low spender tho."
Honestly I have been playing this game since release. The issue now is the game has way too many irrelevant CE cards and it's been twice now that the promised servant card after 330 summons (spent a tonne on Beast Nero and currently Medusa Saber). I am currently at a point I'll have to stop playing due to the fact I have no new servant summons and all my servants are max level and no more of them are worth upgrading with all 4 star and below servants basically being NP lvl 5 and CE are pointless
The worst rates ever went through 1k quartz got 2 5 stars. Trash game.
The BEST. Should add another jeanne spiritron dress (dress from fate carnival). Until then you will get your 5 star haha sorry just jalter fan here
the game is great an all but it's capped on 30 fps on my phone..
the sync account is stupid
"editing my review 6/13/25 been playing since launch on jp so i remember what a nightmare the original game was when it first started. that being said there have been many good QoL changes to the game since then and once you get to Camelot the story finally gets good. the first 5 singularities were mediocre at best and even some of 2.0 was disappointing. there's not enough space to explain why. anyway if you're getting into this for the story, please don't have high expectations"
"Okay, had trouble with my old phone, the support team was great, which I should have contact them around February, when the game crashed instead of waiting until today, aka 4 months. Best to always remember the Transfer number and Password, especially if you're forgetful like me, do it once a month and always write it down. Thank you FGO US support!"
good
The best app ever and I like this app
will not play until the option to use 10 summon tickets at a time is implemented. summon animation to long to have to use 1 card at a time. 2 stats loat.
"Outdated gacha game with bad rate, bad QoL, repetitive gameplay. At least the story is good at times"
"First off: while I give this game a full score, I have to mention that this game is sort of the opposite of your big, mainstream gacha game. The beginning is the most painful part as you are completely without options besides other people's Servants, whatever the beginner gacha offers and a few other things. This game gets a lot more interesting once you gather many Servants (even low rarity ones) and can make teams. It offers a good degree of freedom and looks great in its 2D anime-style."
the rates are abysmal
"So good a Fate/[title], I didn't mind starting over again. (to clarify, I got a new phone, lol)"
"Personally, if FGO had an account binding, it would make the game even better. that way, I can just use my account to log in with out worrying about losing my progress....as I just lost my 3rd account..last month."
I just want to thank the designer of the shot 10 fight in the saber Medusa event with this 1 star review. I despise you so much for making such an annoying brick wall fight. An unkillable enemy that can AOE NP in 3 turns with disastrous curse AND A CHARGE skill?! I hate you so much!
I have no Quartzü§£
I lost all my stuff because of the dumb password safe I type my password and what I find I'm back to the Beginning all my 5 4 3 2 1 stars gone my 15 sant Courts gone so hopefully they have an email save for players to re gain there game play stats back I'm sorry I won't be playing this game anymore
there's a bug i cant play the game after playing a 2 months. one day suddenly then i enter the game there's no loading screen menu its only showing black screen and no loading screen please fix this. i cant play the game!
"you know, I've had a lot of fun with it. there are certainly more interactive gatcha games, and i don't lobe that it doesn't map your account to Google so if your phone is lost / stolen or unexpectedly breaks you are SOL and need to start over."
it's getting worse
"Lack of Limited Time Event Early Access Too many limited time events you miss out on, due to STORY PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS so far ahead, all of which demand you to have put so much time and effort into a game and pray that your team can actually survive through the stages and make it to those benchmarks. This game should pull from other gachas, and give players the CHOICE to play the event without reaching the prerequisite story benchmarks. Give us a CHOICE. Don't force new people to miss out"
"I love this game! I have been playing since near NA launch, and the game is rewarding even if you play for free. There are regular updates, challenging new content fairly often, and the mechanics and strategies you can come up with make it fun! If you love the anime/manga, history and mythology, or both, it's a fun time."
"It's a good game, and I love that its based off the fate series, I still don't like the fact that you have to farm for everything though; I would love some kind of system for missions you've completed before so you dont have to waste literal hours getting one item at a time, it would definitely make this game a 10/10, also the gachas not as bad as other money grabbers, i usually get what i'm after if i prepare a lil' bit, so thats really cool."
"unfortunately, this game slaps."
a good game
It's a good game that you don't need to pay to win in you can play it without having to spend any money on it you could go through the whole game with only your starter units and it does have a gacha mechanisms and you don't have a auto battle mechanic in this game but it's a good fate game it's the only fate game on mobile to my knowledge
"No comment, just straight up awesome"
I've been playing this game for years now. it is actually garbage. the summon rates are some of the worse I've ever played. I recommend any other game over this garbage.
"Phone <1 year old, fully updated, no software mods = Does NOT Work Thanks, Aniplex, for a broken app. I replaced my phone with an even OLDER phone. Game works. Good game. Game still good. 6 years later, game still good."
watch fate/zero first and other fate series if you want to enjoy this game to the max
"4/17/2023Been a player for 3 years ü§£and its april, my birthday is in 22 can i get a an arcueid ü§£ü§£ 06102025 hehehe still a player for 5 years now give me Lilith ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
many problems
I don't have time for stories anymore. Growing up is pain. Rate up is a lie.
I love fate/GOüëå
I am so happy when my anime turned into game i can now meet my waifuu everyday but the problem is the summoning has hard advantage to get your characters
‚úãÔ∏èAbsolute Cinemaü§ö
wat da hil
I love the game but please give an autofarm and and give the earlier servants their animation updates dap my boy darius up
"IT'S FINALLY AVAILABLE IN MY COUNTRY!!!!! Thank you lasangle! Been playing for three and a half years. I love the fate franchise and fgo is a really entertaining game. It's a lot of grinding but that's to be expected of a gacha game. Sometimes I take short breaks when I lack time, but I can't stay away for long. PS 12y rating is inaccurate. This is a Gacha game with visual novel elements. It will encourage players to spend and some arts are quite suggestive the story is too lore heavy 4 kids."
I love mash patotieee
"Edit 1: Somehow the already pretentious story got WORSE. Still overhyped into the next plane by simplistic simps who think something that seems a tad complex, yet ignores its own lore or any logic SOMEHOW qualifies as a ""good story"". Currency gain: STILL DIRE , qol: STILL TRASH. np skip? WHO NEEDS IT? I dunno? SENSIBLE ppl who aren't dumb enough to watch the same trash animationx100? The playerbase that loves to ignore/normalise its flaws with silly memes is the butt end of the bad joke ie fgo"
"The gacha rate is really ""fun"" and ""friendly"""
hoping for the account binding patch to come in NA
"low drop rate, expensive, no chat, no skip button for np animation, no auto farm, repetitive character design, long maintenance, outdated, gameplay not optimize,, (2019)"
really good and the characters are also good
sad pity
I just wanted Astolfo üò≠
Four Stars Because I like it and I've been watching the Anime itself for quite some years and my game Crash that's why it's only Four star and I downloaded game because I'm intrigued after watching the Anime itself
"Great experience üëç, will suck your life and wallet away from you."
"Way too many different upgrade materials with abysmal droprates, events locked behind story progression, barely QoL updates, decent battle system, great story. Overall the best gacha game on the market."
"Game is greedy af, its 2025 and there's still next to no guarantee pity, no pull progress carried forward, nothing just so you think you will earn more money that way and your premium currency is expensive. Here's what a healthy man with a job and family gotta do. Uninstall your game and invest in other gacha games."
oh well it lasted for so long and they made the gacha f2p unfriendly. i used t get new 5 stars from saving quarts but yeah i mostly get useless 5 star cards that i dont really need made almost all 4 star characters to max NP cant even convert the extras to get 5 star characters. it's make me really sad. to see a childhood game turn into a pay to win game. i prefer other games and spend money there. don't recommend this one for people who is going to be f2p. good luck eveyone
it's fine
my servants gone missing after the update
I adore how the characters look especially fou! He's so cute! this game is pretty easy to operate after learning the tutorials. üòÅüêæ
Game badly needs an auto/instant clear for cleared stages for farming purposes other than that the game is good
"get a veter acc savin format te 1 tim cod use is anoyin, sumons suk nd so cal rate up drop is a lie, varly evy get a rate up serven wuld giv zero stars vut cant"
"I gave you five star, now give me five star hehe"
you can lose all your progress with a single crash
"Far above your typical mobile game, this is a visual novel with a gacha component. Animations and art are beautiful, soundtrack is masterful. The game rewards ""whales"" but is very F2P friendly at it's core, with free units being part of the meta just as much as gacha exclusives. The only mobile game that has kept me as a concurrent player for more than a year. Still going strong, been playing since launch till now. (06/16/21). UPDATE: Still playing as of (06/02/25)."
one of the best 10/10
Patience patience patience
"not actually in English (voices are in another language, despite being English being in the title of the game). Also, the tutorial forces you to waste resources and send friend requests to random people. the free summon material has the same icon as the paid summon material, making it hard to differentiate on an already incredibly hard to process summon screen."
"I was going to write an essay but I'll make it shorter. unfriendly gacha, free 5 star you will realize is useless because outdated. gameplays fun but tedious. takes too long to get rewards for clearing stages. if your not a fate fan don't waste your time. it's designed to be played constantly until you catch up and god knows how long that'll take."
awful gaming experience. if you have not tried the original VN then nothing is really explained and as a fan i absolutely hated the long winded hand holding. it grew tediously on my nerves and got uninstalled before it even remotely hooked my interest
"Fix your garbage game, its not letting me in or play the game, keeps saying, ""failed to connect to server"""
"It has many good stories. It has lots of good characters. once you get past the first main story arc, the game devolves into unfun boss fights one after another. The game is insufferably laggy at times especially in lostbelt 7's map and raid boss. The gacha rates are awful and so is the pity system. Nobody rolls story banner unless they are new and it should give us a free 10 pull on story every month."
The storyline is great but not worth the effort later on. When the game mechanics is designed to have you wipe and use laystones or saintquartz. I spent more time reading and searching to get past the main storyline and still fail then playing the game. FGO has lost me as a spender and player.
"I keep losing my account when I haven't played for a long time, I thought I got it saved since I got the same phone to play on it but my account is just gone.. I wish theres a skip tutorial."
no real pity and one of the worse gacha systems. Just watch lore videos on youtube and skip the game.
"would have kept the app around if it was easier to recover my account. I say that because the game can get boring real quick for me, especially when the game would rather make you spend money for more and better servants"
"Best of all time!!! Great Visual novel with detailed design on each character all in a turn based role playing game, you should try... The only issue is gacha I suggest you save your Saint Quartz for your Favorite servant! P.S don't forget to take a picture of your transfer code (no link system) Menu -> My Room -> Issue Transfer Number"
"I loved this game for years, but the Ort fight alone is making me want to stop playing. I can barley get past the first part of the fight due to my lack of 60 or more 5 stars. I can't move forward in the story without the possibility of spending hundreds of dollars on summons, only to get 1 more 5 star that's not gonna make a difference. As a tip to new players, DO NOT burn any 3 or 4 star servants unless necessary."
"This is the stingiest gacha for newbies ever Also this is my second time losing my acc with this stupid sync system like it is hard to change this, this game released a long ago and they still think this is a great idea, never installing this garbage again."
Pay to win game always favouring rich people.... The update is the good for new players you can not win by any chance unless you buy something real Cash..... gacha is terribly bad.... Spending time with this game is good factor!!
"It really is one of the worst gacha game out there in term of everything , the only good thing about this game are the stories ,the gacha are dreadfull and the UI is dogshit"
amazing
Great story and Awesome characters & Voice actors
"had to undownload it and usually my account aways usually alright after I re-download it but account is gone at least 50 5 stars gone some I got from events, not going through the whole origin again feels like genshin all over again."
I'm beginning to think that this game is pay to win as of late. I just can't seem to be able to get past Ort.
"This game is ancient, grind is extremely tedious, pull currency is hard to come by, and yet a blatant cash cow like this still have players forfeiting their mortal possessions as if the game is THE IRS. 500 words cannot even describe the hours I spent grinding for specific materials and pull currency only to evaporate like water under the desert sun..."
"keep summoning until u get lancelot or zenobia, lancelot has high damage, and zenobia has combos, good buffs, and high Def. but if u get ibaraki douji, she is also a great char. and will also help u out. hope my review is helpful for uguys!"
"so great game don't get me wrong, but it'd be nice if they separated essence summons from character summoms because you're getting more essences than characters most of the time"
great game and gaming experience
Using A.I. in the trailers is in bad taste. Ew.
bad pull rates
"Great game, I've managed to play through the main story and get a handful of rare servants completely F2P. You don't have to spend money to progress, only if you REALLY want a particular servant. That said, there are a few areas for improvement. Grinding materials is a massive pain and there's no auto-play feature. When you do decide to try the gacha, the odds of getting specifically what you want are quite low. The story is amazing though, that's easily the best quality of this game."
Plssss improve the quality of game
Si eres un fan de la saga de fate este juego es muy recomendable.
No Complain!
Rate system
"re-edit. gave 3 stars for it being a favorite mobile game for years...but I'm so tired of the RIDICULOUSLY POOR pull rates, for any event. Craft essence...so sick of those words anymore. most people, even the ones that played for years, only have a single character of the 5 star characters and they pay real money. the rate is dumb and I think it's on purpose for more money. I stopped spending real money till this is fixed. and the game is FULL of amazing characters, so give some out!"
"Juegazo 10/10 el gameplay es insoportable y me salto todas las animaciones, nunca hacen colaboraciones y los eventos son todos los mismo Dios como amo este juego"
When will you guys add a google account transfer to save my in game progress when I delete the game
"story was a drag... don't always care for ""another new saber"""
not fun
Otis üíó
"nah this is crazy the pitty system in this game is horrible, spent 300$ trying to get a SINGLE copy of kuku bruh not even one I'm just going to stick to wuwa and hoyo games at this point because if I did spend that much on those games I could atleast buy a copy for free in shop or have a diff currency to help with future pulls but not in fgo 300$ gone to the air Gg you got me ill take the L and not play this anymore."
good game
"There is nothing to do in the game beyond farming, advanced quests, and story. No type of endgame to test accounts or any type of game mode to pass dead weeks. If summoning rates weren't as garbage, people wouldn't stop playing. There is literally no incentive beyond story to play this game which is completely watchable online. What is the point of this game then? $1000 plus dollar account for a game with nothing to play."
One thing I hate about this game is that it doesn't have account bind like other games where you can connect your account in your email or Google playgames...
Great Customer Service!!
w game
still enjoy playing it since the 1st release and the only game I've played up until now. don't know why but it just still has the vibe than other gacha games.
Just play the game...
it's fine just not for me.
"Game needs lots of work. Black screen, characters talking during summoning when you just want to claim and move on. They don't keep it simple enough. You have to claim an award and still have to go to mail to get it. Stupid and unnecessary. Not a fun game at all."
"good gameplay mechanics, story, and characters. just about everything else is utterly awful. no effort to make meaningful changes or updates and no appreciation for the player or respect for their time."
"The OG Gacha experience as far as I'm concerned. Great characters, great designs, good translations, absolutely terrible summoning system. Go in knowing that you likely won't summon the characters you want, it's still a fun time."
"Pretty good gameplay, but the account recovery could still use some work. Or maybe we could just link our accounts to our emails if we were allowed to. And the art for the cards needs to be higher quality, too. Not just scaled up."
I like this game but bringing back your old account it's so understanding
Pretty much everything wrong with the gacha game genre spawned from here
"It's not perfect, been playing on and off since Anime Expo 2017 and compared to many games now F/GO is pretty outdated in many ways. The story is everything (horror, sci-fi, fantasy, charming, disgusting, good, bad). Dont get too attached to the gacha, the rates can suck but it honestly doesnt matter, then again i was a whale when i started."
game good
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THE ENMA-TEI EVENT TIME LOCKED. PEOPLE HAVE LIVES THEY NEED TO LIVE AND I LITERALLY CANT COMPLETE THE EVENT CAUSE I WAS TIME LOCKED OUT CAUSE I HAD TO DO STORY FIRST. NEVER DO THIS AGAIN.
My honest review on this game is really ¬≤ bad because of the lack events and the gacha system which is super bad the rates were bad and the events are always about fighting not rewards and stuff and the daily log in??? rewards are suck and it will take 2-3 or more days to get 30 crystals like what??? I must say this is the most ick games for f2p players it's only fun at the beginning trust me...(still play it tho)
"everything is great, EXCEPT the gacha pity system so awful, 900 SQ minimum is so miserly. Account transfer & recovery too, why not allowing player to bind with Google Play like a normal game would do? This game have a lot work to do"
This has to be one of the best games for boring nights or rainy days
come too far to quit. playing since launch
"Awesome graphs and uhh.. great story but erm, got a bit bored of it overtime."
the game is super good but the problem is the rewards and the upgrading is bad and I can't save account which sometimes I lost many accounts to it so pls fix itü•∫üëç
bad gacha rates period
>:( my account is gone. or I just can't get into It
"Good jap VAs, some interesting stories but dated 2d animation, repetitive pve gameplay and grindy. Not p2w n actually f2p friendly as u can add support/event heroes to ur 1-4* f2p roster n strategically rolling earned quartz during banners can get u the 5* u desire. Completing events gets u a free 5np 4* + mats. Best part is u can cont midbattle if u accidentally closed ur app. No guild/chat so its a solo exp."
it's amazing but I wish it wasn't lagging often because my wifi and data is amazing but at the start of the game it lags after it doesn't it only happens at the start of it
still no accounts
"I've been playing this game for almost 4 years and still loving it to be fair. But some servant sprites and animations are so outdated, Quetzalcoatl for instance, a popular servant but didn't receive any animation or sprite update for the longest time. Please upgrade the overall graphics so that it can compete with other mobile games, as of the moment..the game looks old and outdated"
try to transfer my progress from my old phone to the new one but it won't let me it won't let me do it can you please help me
Im not a huge fan of how Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova was designed since she was sexually harrased during house arrest in Yekaterinburg and assaulted after she was killed plus she's 17 and a Saint so it's disrespectful
"A gacha game of old, that has failed to keep up with its contemporaries in any meaningful sense. It is stingy compared to many of the more recent gachas to gain traction, and events barely differ from one another, making the game feel stale after this long a runtime. Grail Fronts, the gameplay mode that shakes things up the most barely occur. The game needs to adapt to the times, or it will languish, be it sooner or later."
Good to pass the time. The gacha is merciless but that's what it is.
Trash game ever. even 1gb. not worth.
Drop rate is abysmal. I've been grinding for days and not even gotten a 5 star unit. Hours for nothing.
"lately drops and chances of getting 5 star look to be changed or temper with lowering them, events haven't changed at all, and boss battles and challenges are more gimmick than good or memorable. for years, I asked for live2d in themain menu, never got it. for the last 3 months I keep summoning and summoning I try so hard for Tiamat and beast trowing my check at them not even one of them I have to say it got me so demoralized that I decided to just give up I'm deleting the game I'm done"
Absolutely no
i love it
it is possible to recover account if you forgot the password? (I still have the transfer code)
"Unable to recover my data... Great game but I REFUSE to start over for the ""umphteenth"" time... Sorry uninstall... RIP FATE/ORDER... The game deserved better back up features.... Would of giving it 5 stars"
nice
"I've been playing since the start of JP and back then it was way horrible than the newer reviews here describe. The game got better overtime with the system updates and really peaked with its story. FGO is in general a mix of a VN with a battle system and Gacha mechanic. No matter how old the game gets, players will still comeback for the story update given how great it is written. Currently FGO has about roughly 19+ stories that on their own can be an anime and some already are."
still playing the game and I still agree with the review. I have been playing for years now
the best game I ever played
"Game's data transfer system is among the worst in the industry, and even with the recent 330 pull hard pity you are not going to get most characters you want if you are financially responsible. But the lore and premise is among the best, thankfully other FATE/Nasuverse games exist, play those"
Aesc and Bunny Artoia plz
dude this game is awesome the storyline is dope I'm on lostbelt one but it's cool. my two favorite servants are Gawain and Arthur Pendragon. even though I don't have Arthur I've been saving to get him in a future banner. I've been trying to get Gawain but I can't because the gacha system. no 4 stars. but I might give it a 5 if you fix the gacha system
great game
this game is nice i love FGO
Goated game tried in 2025 wish it had account binding with Google so I could play on my pc and yall should remake this game as a open world 3d gacha game like Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves that would be so peak
"the game is choppy on some battle animations even on low resolution and tends to slow down, but overall, it's still an amazing game"
peak
peak because i love fate lmao
"04/20/2025: Great improvements! No more crashing or lagging. The game and the nostalgic feeling of it made me revisit the Type Moon/FATE series again. 06/22/2022: The game was excellent until the last update, but now the constant crashes make the game almost unplayable. With every crash, the game is force to reset and a battle that usually takes a couple of minutes now three times the usual duration. Please fix would hate to abandon such a good game."
love the game
"it opened fine just the other night, Ive reopenned the app, cleared cache, restarted phone but right now it remains a black screen."
"One of the worst gachas ever to exist. I've been rolling for five months and haven't even gotten a 5star or 4star. So, I suggest to all new players or returnees if you're F2P or don't have a mental health problem, don't play this game. However, if you enjoy the story or don't mind not having ssr, it's okay to play the game"
I will give 5 star if i get archer Nobu Edit: I got archer Nobu ü•∞
"gameplay is boring, and they hardly give currency for pulls and the pity system just straight out sucks."
love it
Rate up is a lie. Still waiting for summer Kiyohime T-T
Terrible Absolutely Terrible DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Literally play any other game.
"Controls are easy to understand. Filtering options have also improved. Overall, there were great improvements that made the gameplay a lot more fun."
Game has become progressively worse as they introduce too many ways to strengthen servants. Using servants with average investment now feels terrible because the strength gap causing a noticeable handicap when using them. I've abandoned 99% of my roster and it's the worst feeling.
Improve how you handle save data somehow please like saaaay linking to a google account im tired of losing progress
I lost my data and I want to play the game
"Love the game I really do but there is some major lag for no reason, and the game crashes every other turn it makes the game almost unplayable."
Horrible gacha rates. Never getting characters you care about unless you have $10k to drop or able to save 900sq
"The story is very good, but unfortunately, it's the only reason you should ever install this game. Coming from a huge Fate fan, the gameplay loop is excruciatingly repetitive and not worth investing your time into. Also, the UI is very dated, and coming from a studio that consistently makes the top 10 in global gacha earnings, there's no excuse for that. This game also has some of the worst rates in gacha currently. All in all, just buy a farmed account and read the story, and then uninstall."
"Behold on your device if low spec or low storage. 2D/turn-base action card gacha game, it used almost 20GB for update and download all data, more than some 3D action nonCard gacha game out there. can still see some ended event info., unoptimized af. loading almost everytimes when move from menu to menu. good story. battle: some combo is keep attack on dead enemy, wasted damage. can use only 2heroes for frontline, force you to select supporter and always ask for follow when finish, annoying."
It's Great üëç
"it keeps crashing everytime I start the game, guess my old tablet isn't capable for this game"
Game keeps on kicking me out between loading screens on the new missions for Draco
it would be nice to have an f2p way to get servent coins
I really like the Story. It actually feels like the game focuses on the story and not focus on the game play and not the story. But the game play is meh.
Man this game is bootycheeks! I can't with the gacha rates is actually bad I ain't paying and playing.
deserves a link account system like google or any social media apps but game still good
"Gameplay sucks, if you are here for fun then don't play. story and characters is what makes this game great but the story gets very convoluted in the second part so only play for the singularities. This is the worst gacha game I have ever played. You have better odds playing Genshin and getting a 5 star to constellation 6 before you have a chance at even getting a limited 4 star. Just buy Fate Extella, it has a fun gameplay, story, and is not a gacha. Top it all with a terrible support staff."
I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OF THEMüò≠ AFTER TWO YEARS OF CAN'T OPEN MY ACCOUNT I FINALLY OPENED IT THANKS TO THEM YOU'RE THE BEST SUPERüôèüò≠ THANK YOU VERY MUCH
sigma sigma boy
"The game sucks . The gacha summon is rigged, and the chance of getting a four - or five-star is low."
"the game is fun but it has performance issues on phones, like stuttering and on older phones it can make them heat up."
this is so awful I like it on a little bit but my first got it a kicked me off and then when my sister going to get kicked her off because we are in a little early didn't let us keep her avatars nothing like you have to do it again I'm so sick of it I'm never getting this game again
this game gacha rate suck as always f lsg

till they add linking for Google play it will always be 1 star
"I have horrible self-control. In general life and also in this game. I previously have only been able to save up only for about 2 multis. I saved 580 sq and 57 summon tickets for Tiamat, and didn't get her. I've been waiting for her to be playable ever since the last singularity released nearly 7 years ago. I used to not understand the memes about FGO's abysmal rates, but that's because I never went deep into banners, until now. I think I'm gonna have to drop this game here after 8 years."
"Better give me Muramasa (2025 edit: I made this review from 2022, my wish has been granted)"
I love the characters in the fate series
"Why take the names of those from history if you're not going to base the characters off of the names? When you realize it's a shallow attempt to gain interest for another bad mobile game it helps light the field you're working with. A huge let down, could have been very interesting. Would have had more respect if they didn't dig up graves."
the game is good if you like the fate series but have werid difficulty system and the story mode for some reson become so easy to play.
"android ver. especially newr model isn't stable and will crash very often, hasn't been fixed for months, either dont update os or play on a older phone."
"i thought i was going to see some great graphics and top-tier ultimate move animations, but what i got was the same lame laser beam ultimate with different colors and sub par graphics."
i failed Tiamat
Fun with the gacha
"Tough gacha system, but satisfying gameplay once you learn the mechanics"
nice im a fan of fate series
Not f2p friendly and rate ups are fake.
trash but smash
"so good, the best gacha mobile ever!"
"I'll be honest I don't really enjoy the game play, but I love fate in general, so..."
its crazy that i still plays this brutal gacha game
"Why can my device not be connected with the game server? I have good Internet speed and I can connect with the Fate Grand Order(JP version). But why not the English version? I even had to uninstall the game a couple of times but nothing seems to work. At this point I just hope my account is still safe. The problem was fixed quite a while ago, so thank uüôÉ"
"Constantly keeps crashing; closing the app ever since the last 3 updates. I can barely collect daily login rewards, let alone play the game itself."
Arguably the worst gacha game I ever play. Just a cash cow for the big fate IP franchise. Repetitive gameplay & events. Only farming until EoS. Just play Vn or other fate series games on steam. And if you are curious about the story just watch the anime or comic. Don't touch this game.
"Its so fun game, can I ask something? Can you pls add some of Filipino Myth here in the game? Like Bakunawa(The Moon Eather) or Mayari(One-Eyed Moon Goddess). Thank you... pls pls pls pls pls"
"worst gacha experience ever, still no 5* since the last summer absolute stupid rate chance & pity"
"330 bug guaranteed 5‚≠ê no summoned Not F2P friendly not much rolling due to Limited saint quartz . No auto play/mission multipler , very time consuming/load, Very grindy , repetitive game play, couldve been amazing success if it was like geshin impact. It like downgrade verison of it. The good: noble phantasm and story the rest is minimum effort . the reason I played this game is because I'm fan of the anime. i regret playing this game . Hercules sucks without his CE , he's so reliant on it."
"Thank you for letting me know that FREE crystals is still the best than PAID crystals. This is my FIRST and LAST purchase of P3990 of your virtual product worth of PAID crystals. If i hadnt pulled for the 11 Paid crystals with 11x pulls of ordinary servants, i wont get anything special. Tiamat pulls is nothing but a garbage, i didnt even get any Tiamat. Thank you for letting me know that your offers do sucks, purchase wont happen again ever!!...."
PLEASE FIX MELUSINE RAY HORIZON SKILL BUG
Give me my Gilgamesh Edit:I got him after 1 year and a half. Edit 2: he is now NP2 EDIT 3: I now have him NP5 as well as Maou NP5
"playing this game for 4 years, still love it till this day. edit: very burnt out ._."
"It's a Gacha. if you don't like that, then just turn away. EZ PZ. Ok, after that, this game is fairly fantastic. The story - essentially a visual novel with minimal choice on how the story runs - its quite well written. There are a lot of seasonal events and random other side story things that the developers pop out, so if you happen to finish the story - in like 60 hours - you won't be wanting. Gameplay is pretty cool... and if you don't like certain aspects of it, there are things to modify it"
"‚úÖÔ∏è Character Designs ‚úÖÔ∏è Storyline and Event Stories ‚úÖÔ∏è Simple Combat ‚ùåÔ∏èGatcha System 330 pity ‚ùåÔ∏è Takes a while to get enough for a multi ‚ùåÔ∏è Most new and story-driven events are locked behind completing ALL 8 SINGULARITIES which if you don't know, are 133 main missions. By the time you do that slog the event that got you excited might be gone. If you have the time and patience, you just might enjoy your time here. If not, please love yourself and find another game."
Pretty unstable lately.
gimme a draco dangit
"While the gacha is as unfair as they come, most of the story is engaging and most of the characters are very cool."
"Great characters, great story (although it starts off very bland) and some memes to try out. Very f2p friendly as well (rates are trash, though) since free units are totally viable at every stage. Edit: While the above is true the game is very outdated by modern standards. Also story release pace has slowed to a crawl in the JP server. That on top of the awful coin system they introduced make this a game that's not bad but seriously hard to recommend."
"Uninstalled, call me when this game gets a REAL account backup option... EDIT: Reinstalled the game after so long, just to find out it still lacks more backup options... uninstalled again..."
Best mobile game ever.
Some bosses kinda problematic at lostbelts and some servants are hard to get it's like an pay to win game it's annoying
"it's laggy at times, freezes"
Ishtar feet.
"Drop rates are miserable, loads are painstaking... game play is sub fun..."
i got a question why is Miyu there but not the Shirou from her verse also?
"this game has an outdated system, that's it's only flaw, people say the rates are low on summoner's, but I ones pulled 3 Arcatype Earth's with less then 200 Crystals"
Best Gacha game for me.
So im changing my review compared to other gatcha games released in recent years fgo really needs to shape up and evolve dont get me wrong the story is still top tier its servents only get better but man the gatcha just is not worth it because either A you get the servent or B you get nothing and just waste sq so they really should do pity carry over because nothing is worst then going 200 sq deep and getting nothing and then it all go's away so until changed im done with fgo.
5/5 because archer gil is np5
Great story!
"I've been playing this game regularly for a few years now and I love absolutely everything about it. From the servants, to the story, to the gameplay, FGO has really caught my attention and held it for years."
Terrible gacha rate for characters.
"one of the best game i played and i love the story line, but i hope in the future we can connect our account to google play acc.."
I would have given 5 stars if not for 2 flaws I think need improvements. Overall great game love the graphics but the drop rates are abysmal and 1 pity is 600 dollars. 9/10 pulls are nothing but craft essences and usually not a good 5 star craft essence. Seems certain craft essences have a lower chance than others cuz getting copies of trash ones is extremely common.
"if you like gambling and grinding your life away, this game is for you"
gacha rates are low
i would like to have massaging features with friends.
horrible the gacha has no skip animation button so you just have to sit there waiting for the gacha animation to be over then NO AUTO MODE FOR A GAME THATS CLEARLY REPEATABLE?!!?!
"A great rpg, I also love the anime series"
low quality game. you have high grossing game but cant upgrade the game? japanese devs team is changing .
tezcalitpoca final fight. and lostbelt 7 as a whole is an utter disgrace and should either be updated to be fair or removed entirely the gall in that final fight to give the boss a free revive and permastun your party is a joke and every other tez fight is just jankily made. ORT was the best part of this lostbelt and the only fair fight I think I actually have hatred for a fictional character for the first time in my life with daybit the cheat.
Its a great game. Live the gameplay and animations. But its always difficult to get a five star
"The writing for some of these events is awful; cringe localization and typos are not helping. Bad rates and archaic systems that don't improve compared to their competitors. gatcha will always be bad, so go ahead and waste your money. The apps stability has gotten worse than before, constantly crashing now when minimized."
Fun but can get boring.
"pros: - great story, possibly best of the gachas games - character designs - fun/strategic gameplay cons: - time consuming(no sweep no auto) - gacha rate - not f2p friendly"
bad video game so not recommend
"A solid 5 star,why? Cause the stories are great, graphics is cool, and gameplay is amazing,and the servants were great.The drop-rate for the servants is high too.The game is generous in rewards too!.My current team is Koyanskaya of Dark and Sitonai.Good job creators! I love this game. Edit: I lost my account because I forgot the password needed :( Edit: I cannot log in to my account though I knew my password and transfer number."
it would be nice to have this on Steam or something
my fav gameü§ç
"No, don't."
full of loading screens. if i play for an hour 30 minutes of it would be loading screens. no lies. my internet ain't having problems with anything else but this. i played this game way back 2021 and came back now (2025) hoping that it improved but my experience says otherwise. would've been fun but it is what it is.
Big W
"I would appreciate it if you devs can make a QoL relating to the accounts. Make it so that we can bind our accounts to Google, or if not then make an official FGO Account Service that we can register and log in to rather than having to use 1-time use Data Transfer. Data Transfer is literally a Decade Old thing, that alone adds more trouble to the long time players of the game, We need an account QoL that assures the safety of our Account Data, not by this archaic medieval feature lmao."
"This game is boring tbh, and plus it's freaking expensive, spending 1000$ of your money on some jpeg"
"Was an active player since August 2017 and finally quit January 2025. Let me just say, the ONLY selling point of this game is that it's the main ""Fate"" game currently. As a gacha game, it is probably the game that respects its players' time and money the least out of all the popular ones out there with terrible gacha rates and very little QOL improvements despite the budget it no doubt has. There are other games just as/more enjoyable out there that you will not waste as much time/money on."
There needs to be a quality of life update in the summoning system. You can't use tickets for a ten pull only individual even when you have a lot more than ten tickets. In other games you can use ten tickets for pulls instead of the summoning currency (saint quartz in fgo) for the ten pull which saves time.
I see maybe because I rerolled many times that artorias name is not spelled right it says altria or something a good game should be careful with your f2p materials it does a good job explaining how to play
really good fr fr..üòÜ
I wanna play again but my entire progress gone...
"Fun stories but an absolute lack of content aside from grinding once you finish it up, not much of a game and hardly worth taking up space. Sad because they make enough money to make the game better too."
That's hell you're walking into
"W GAME, W STORY, W CHARACTERS, W COMMUNITY, EVERYTHING IS A W. dislike the gatcha rates :("
"This game used to be good. The people in charge keep prioritizing aesthetics, waifus and shiny prizes over funtionality and replayability."
"Amazing story, charectors, gameplay, and visuals. I have spent an embarrassingly long time playing, but it's by far my favorite mobile games. If you like the fate series, i would highly recommend it."
Almost Everything is good. Gacha rates on Servants: 5* = 1% 4* =3%.
Its a OK game but the Gacha System is trashüòí
"Highly recommend it and God bless you all, also when could more of rewards? I really want new characters in my roster^^"
Extremely poorly written and poorly programmed gotcha game only kept alive by it's bs fomo events and the fact that the writing actually gets good but only at the end of the first bloated campaign.
There are few people that put 1 star because they say they lost their account i know cuz it happened but it was because i didn't register a password which all of you need to put and screenshot the password but also trust when i say i took me 5 erased account that i didnt put password to finally get it so remember put a password and screenshot cuz i done this 5 times and now ive been with my current account for 2 years even after changing for a new phone
DIS GAEM IZ 4 MEN!! DIS GAEM SUKKSSS
"Game keeps crashing, literally unplayable"
My favorite mobile game ü•∞
"The UI in this game is the worst. There is no skip bar, too much buffering, and no easy way to access quests, settings and other in game options without going through hell of long loading screens. Personally, I like the gameplay and the characters, but because of the User Interface, Long Loading Screens (which is not supposed to be there!!!), and getting lost in the menu, this game made me lost interest in playing it again."
"Amazing story and cool servants, can't wait for what the future holds."
"It has Astolfo, instant 10/10"
"Pain to grind, hard to farm, no auto, poor gatcha rates"
Nice
Love The Game and Story.
"The greatest game to play on the toilet! Even though it's a gacha game, you actually don't have to spend money at all if you're reasonably patient! Also the story is very good!"
Way to hard to get summuons
"Would Rate The Game 5 Stars, if there's Auto Battle or Skip Battle Option like other Games."
"Ruined my life, 10/10"
"I dont make many reviews, but this game deserves one, not for being a good game which it is not. The art and story telling are really good, but everything else is honestly so bad that this game is a disgrace to all gamers, game developers, and lovers of the fate series. Every aspect of this game points to the fact that the company is just greedy and want money and don't really care about their player base. I could write an entire essay about how bad it is, but to summarize, play any other game."
Boring ahh game
astolfo (2 of them)
When's the next update for the accounts and linking them to your Google account?
"This is still my favorite game story Is top tier cause I'm a fan of fate ,even though I'm so frustrated by the LOADING one after another ,sometimes the loading time is longer than my actual gameplayü•π. Im waiting for a 3d rpg of this game like the gameplay of other rpg like SL.,still I love this game.."
"Have to delete game. Pull rates are atrocious for how much saving and grinding i did for the saint quartz. It was a massive waste of my time, and I'm not willing to spend any money on it. It's just not that good of a game."
I finally have both Ereshkigal and Meltryllis üôå
"Accidentally deleted the game and now years of play time and money are gone. I wish I could tie the game to my Gmail or something, but if you change phones or uninstall without getting a transfer code you are out of luck."
If you played this game. You know why its a 1 star
"Wonderful story, characters and gameplay. Enjoyed playing over the past few years with my wife"
Good Game! Forever Love FGO!
App has repeatedly crashed on the title screen. Not even clearing the cache helps to resolve the issue.
"Game is not even worth it anymore, it's so behind in the times that spending money on banners is just a waste of your time and money. There is no auto battle function and each battle and story drags out. In a time where you want a quick battle. This game just elongates the time spent on it for very little in return. They have even implemented boss battle functions that are just cheap. Such as infantile regression which regens the boss back to full health in 5 turns with 3 barriers. No fun"
"It's Fate it's awesome, I wish there was less loli bait"
"Man. Great story, but the grinding and the gacha makes me wanna want to stab myself with gae bolg."
"Great game, great story, great visual arts, and optimization can be done some work. Why can't this game get 4+ rating? Maybe because of device optimization. So please consider it, thanks."
THEY GOT MY ACCOUNT BACK! THANK YOU SO MUCH F/GO!
Miglior gioco di Fate a mani basse. Ci gioco tutti i giorni dal Day One! Spero di trovare Koyanskaya of Light e Kama Summer e Sei l'anno prossimo :) (ho trovato Koyanskaya of Light e Koyanskaya of Darkness ü•≥üéâ)
Absolutely spectacular Gacha game.
This game sucks
:3 ƒë∆∞·ª£c ƒë·ªô gacha r yay
"Good storytelling, great and entertaining gameplay when you just need to unwind or grind stuff. Will continue to play and stay loyal to this game for a long time that's for sure. Not to mention best customer support I've ever had so props to all of them, still thankful for the assistance in retrieving my account."
"I think the game is okay, but there is room for improvements. It could have auto battle functions where the characters can fight on their own without having to rely on the players. if there's a way to farm for more XP cards to level up the characters. You know, like an auto skip function, like if you beat the mission already? And can do it by skipping it and getting the rewards. like in bleach brave souls. Or 7d grand cross"
"Hirap kumuha ng Character, Pisting yawa na laro to. pay to win ba to?"
"Love yourself, hate the grind"
No offense but I gave this game a 2 star Well the story is very epic and graphic is very good and you play is like a very hard but the real problem is the gacha well you need a 990 saint quartz plus you get a random SSR spooky damn so how many saint quartz we buy 412+$ if you buy that's too much unfair üòë and you get a random SSR and high rate CE yup its very so much unfair
"Fate Grand Order has been around for a long time,and I so truly hope that it will stick around for years to come. Despite the difficulties,Fate Grand Order is fun to play,and easy to get into. Every player around the world can't be wrong when they say that they LOVE Fate Grand Order,and playing that game,as well. Everything about Fate Grand Order is awesome. May it live on for years to come! LONG LIVE FATE GRAND ORDER!"
This game is pay to win no free summon for newbie ahhh don't download this game
Addictive. Strong and amusing story. Attractive servants art but as of recently the art has become ugly. Servants are hard to get(gatcha). Some summon banners are believed to be fake and not with the possibilities written in their info. Some bosses are very hard to win for f2p players and sometimes they have to spend Saints Quartz and at a point I can't even win with spending these because I have to have a certain servant (Kama avenger) for lostbelt 7 and now I'm stuck in this point.
I lost my account of two years because of your outdated account system. Please update it. And not use some one time code
"good story, mediocre gameplay. carried by the fact that it can use Fate characters."
Iskandar and Napoleon and Achilles banana hammock alt when
The gameplay is fun the chariacters are unqiue and the story is great
"Sometimes players have to upgrade their device to play the game and sometimes the update don't work as intended for the players causing them to lose their log in streak. The battle system is fun and its not pay to win game, more so it is a gacha collection game. The effort they give to make a non visual novel gamer stay in the game makes it worth it as I am one of those. The artists & story writers they hire is top notch and you can also win the hard battles with low rarity servants. BALANCEDüíï"
"Edited review: in the beginning, it was fun, playing for nostalgia from the anime and the entertaining storyline and side events. Stopped playing due to phone storage limits. Decided to play again with new phone but could not load previous save, lost transfer code and profile is not linked to email nor to device. Also, gatcha rate is bad compared to other gacha games. As an F2P, had to save up SQ to get only few 5 star characters."
"I want to know what idiot decided that in order to play the new valentines event, you needed to have the new 5 star servant. I spent 150 of my saints quartz that I was saving up not only did I not get the stupid servant, I didn't even pull a single 4 star servant. I saved up so many stamina apples for this too. Horrible game design"
So far good experience. It's a gacha game so it'd even take years until you get the character you want.
Drop rates for featured servants are abysmal even if there is rate up. Game constantly lags and crashes. I literally cannot play the game when it crashes a few minutes after opening it.
Waifu material everywhere. You want any history character as a anime guy or gal? Bam! Fate got it. Mordred as a tomboy with daddy[Mommy] issues? Bam! Fate got. Jeanne De Arc if she was evil and returned? Bam! Fate got it. Plus a thicc story and banging cast [Look it up]. Absolutely great time playing this game. Also you can only pay for summons. The rest is earned and makes the game feel a lot more fun and fair as opposed to 99% of all other mobile games out there.
I hate the ads
"As someone who is a fan of Fate series, this one is a must-play game. Having a rich lore and plenty of fan service is what really got me into this."
"the game is very well crafted and unique, with great characters, but it does take a very tough mind to endure all of the bad gacha rolls you'll get, but keep at it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it"
the definition of pay to win
Good game
It's a good game but the way to save your stuff is not good they need to make it so you can link it to email
Game good but it kinda sucks can be better how by half of some of the currency can be Free level up the characters and phantasms and ap need to level üéöÔ∏è fast I need to be able to skip through the singularity please ü•∫ make an easy way to save so I don't have to permanent have it installed I have to removed another anime game or another game just to update fgo and then reinstall the remove game i dont want to keep fgo installed please look for a new way to save so I don't lose date ifunstalled
Best gouch game ever 10/10 super good best game for phone's
"I just came back after a 6 year hiatus, this game makes it impossible to enjoy. The servant pool is dependant on whether it's a featured. You have to waste 300 dollars/330 attempts before they actually help you out and give you one copy of the 5* SSR. This game is a gatcha scheme for old men that live by themselves w money to waste on waifus. Deleting it right now. Highly recommend to avoid this game."
Trash game no pity gacha sucks but good story tho
Hope this will have a remake or optimisation good game but kinda old
greatest game
"Unbelievable masterful gameplay, replay value at ten Judy all out amazing storyline"
"I love this story so much. I'm quite a ways in as of now, but nowhere near caught up, I'm sure. The gameplay is good and is well designed for touchscreens. It has a gacha system that you can pay for more chances at, but just progressing gives plenty of currency. I don't think it's a great place to enter the Fate franchise, although it will eventually explain Fate's lore more than sufficiently as you progress. I was already a fan of a bunch, but not all (yet) of Fate's media, and this is great."
"I've lost my account 3 times, but I come back everytime. the game has a lot of grinding. it's fun though, and the story isn't so bad either. has a nice community that's more than willing to help. honestly the game would be perfect if it had a built in fga system so you could grind even more while you sleep or need a break or to multi-task. rip to that guy who lost his account and to the circe guyü§ßüñ§"
I love this game. I played all the way through to the last three battles and now I have to start all over. I didn't uninstall or delete anything it's just all gone. I love this game but this is so dumb.
"Excellent storytelling and music. If you're a fan of the Fate IP, you will not be disappointed. As a gacha game, there are better options where drop rates and gameplay are more lucrative, but they never quite live up to the story this game has to offer. If you're unwilling to spend hefty amounts of money to get SSRs, be prepared to rely on your luck, but if you're willing to look past that, you'll see a masterclass in modern sci-fi fantasy that remains unmatched even in 2025."
"Love this game, but wish there was an auto clear function for free stages to make grinding easier."
"The story and game is fun, I'm currently at lostbelt 5, I wanna suggest increasing the amount of summon tickets we can buy from mana prism shop each month , because I cleared most of my free quest I can't find where else to get quartz to summon new servants ."
"Love the game, got a new phone and lost all my progress. The transfer number doesn't make sense. It only works if you get the number before you know you need the number. Please fix this issue, it is the only problem people seem to have with the game and its a big one in my opinion."
"Ive played this game for 2.5 years and it was once my favorite game but after the fever ends it is very clear now that it is a very outdated game, there is barely any fun to be had and farming anything is absolute hell with the most predatory gacha system ever. Not to mention the story is mostly horrible. Other new games are all significantly better than this."
Soo good
deserve it....
ITS NOT TOO LATE TO TURN BACK
"Please add more content to do during dead patches. Also, a way to use more AP to quickly farm dailies would be nice. Been here for almost 7 years, would like to see more quality of life."
"Good game, but i lost my account for three times so 2 stars fro no login system"
Don't horrible greed company
"I can't finish ORT's secon phase, not because it's difficult but because of fps drop. Do something!"
Favorite gacha of all time.
My phone broke due to an accident and could not get my password. Requesting to get password but there customer service is horrible due to email not sending it right which is causing issues to get it. Love the game but service for issues is bad. Won't change this til it's fixed.
Way too outdated. The game is clearly just a cash grab now. The tutorial is far too long and too limiting. You literally read text and tap where the giant flashing arrow tells you to for half an hour.
"Has the most BS, unfun, time wasting boss fights I've ever seen in any game"
Pity system trash please add sync to the game so we save our progress. Unlike other game have sync in some platform like facebook or google
It's gotti kun
save yourself from this horrible pain peko 450 dollar for pity on a png isnt right
Fix your summoning
"terrible gameplay and gacha, beautiful story. would (not?) recommend"
"The only thing you could enjoy of the game is collecting an pulling gacha because the UI is awfull, the interface is slow, the gameplay is repetitive and boring with really few mechanics and most of the story is bad (including how many of the boss battles are designed). Basically the developers are lazy and compered with modern gachas, FGO is stuck in 2010."
My Chromebook can run this. Nice.
"Over 2 years of playing everyday and still loving the game, Seibaaaaaa!!!!!"
"Don't expect much from the gameplay, but the story is where it's good. The only flaw with the story is that you have to slog through 70% snoozefest to get to the 30% good parts"
Editing as I lost my account and on A SUNDAY! THEY REINSTATED MY ACCOUNT THROUGH EMAIL! LEGENDS
"Formation restricted, Please set Mash as a starting member"
"Me before playing Fate grand order: Curios, Handsome, Astonishing, Brilliant, Kawaii"
"This game was one of my favorite gatcha of all time until I started playing Genshin. I have been playing for over 5 years since late 2019. The game play was fun. The story was interesting. The event used to get me hooked up in the beginning, but it's somewhat getting repetative. The biggest issue I have for this game is the gatcha system. The pity system is broken; any pity built will not transfer to the next banner, and a guarantee pity would approximately be 900SQ, which is 30 rolls."
"Good but I lost everything due to phone issues. Can't believe all that I lost, not worth starting again the game like many others should save server side silly system a true waste."
there is a bug where morgan is not naked
Good storytelling. Terrible terrible gameplay
"No no no no no, I can't say no enough, do not do it to yourself....unless you want to spend thousands on it....not friendly to even low spenders.... God I wish I never wasted my time with this game lol"
The game is cool however I think I would be better to have a one time sale for saints quartz. And they should add more summon campaigns. Also they should revive some old events.
This game really needs to link to either there own account or to google play
I like the game I really do but the reason I'm giving it a 1 star rating is because of how the game operates. I don't get why we aren't able to save our games or link it to Google account a Facebook or anything. I had an account I spent 5 years on and had so many characters maxed yet one day the game completely crashed and when I tried to get back on the screen was only black whenever I went on the game for 8 months then and it's not the fault of my device because every other game works fine
Love it
Honestly a insanely intresting series of stories wrapped up with incredibly design characters
"This is my favorite mobile game ever. The story characters, leveling system, strategy system and graphics are all Great. But I do agree that the gacha system in this game is pretty rough. There is a pity system, but it is FAR too high. You need to gather 900saint quartz or around 431$usd worth of pulls just to guarantee one character. Imo the pity should be lowered to 300 saint quartz or around 150$usd. (Which is still WAYY too high). Or the price to buy saint quartz should be lowered."
"Interesting story, rates are horrible but ig it feels really good whenever you do pull someone you like as a result. UI is pretty dated and quality of life takes forever to release. There are some very well written characters though."
Trash gameüêß
"fixed issues with 9th anniversary. But worried about powercreep with Kama. They have gone so long being so good at that, and am worried they messed up."
"Nice, the dog game"
"Its nice, thats all"
The amount of content they pump out for what can be a f2p game is insane. This game has more events story and things to do than most 60 dollar AAA games nowadays.
Your account recovery system is the worst system ever created.
"It's a very excellent game. The story is so beautiful, the characters, the art, everything, I love it. I never thought I'll like this game so much. Thank you for making this excellent game üíØ"
"I love that the story is about the human overcome seemingly impossible hurdles, modern games seems a bit heavy on the gloom and doom. The gameplay is dated but solid. The grinding can get mind-numbing in some events. The gacha is the WORST, no contest. As someone put it: ""Only FGO get to be FGO"". I would not recommend this to new players. Compare to it's competitors, the game is mediocre, saved only by the story and a huge fan base the publisher is too happy to exploit."
"The game itself is decently fun My major gripe is the absurdly small chance at getting 5 and 4 star heroes (seriously, 0.8% for a 5 star on a chance up and 0.006% when it isn't?!) Not to mention you get an insane amount of unnecessary craft essences that you'll never use. PLEASE separate Heroes and Craft Essences from the pull lists! If you do that, you'll still have only about 2% for a 5 star hero but it'll actually be noticeable that there's a ""pickup"" moment for the hero."
This game is very Great and all but there is still one thing left missing and it's a quick play feature where you can just burn your ap in one tap and waste less time than normal when farming....still love it though....
"Why Fate series is good at writing their storyline. To be honest, so far, this game has a good storyline than any other games like Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, although this game lacks game style... The storyline is good overall 9/10. It may seem boring at first because the game style isn't that good... But try to focus on storyline and you will enjoy it so much that you will... Ehem... Gacha your favorite characters here. Spoiler: Genderbend Characters."

I can't log back into my old account
Poorly managed. The company is constantly looking for more employees to take advantage of and management has lied to users and gone back on promises. Story is very repetitive in certain aspects and excpects its cheap writing to get genuine feelings or reactions out of players. Gacha is absolutely horrendous and the game doesn't respect the player's time or committment. FOMO is abused too so I hope new players dont try this game and old players deal with sunken cost fallacy. Music is alright.
"best story, writing and characters of any gacha i have played. the game is not without it's faults (like any gacha), but if you put in the time, it is a rewarding experience. that said, the gacha rates and system hurts what could otherwise be a great game."
Astolfo
Another trash Square Enix title. Sue me...
i have a good experiences in this game i love the series too so iplayed this but its time to say goodbye . tenchu so much
"tied only to app iteration, not to email or anything real. Lost 4 years and thousands of dollars of ""collectibles"" that are apparently now gone because of my phone updating itself. Stay far away. Kind of a scam (?) </3"
Tired of starting over. Tired of a bad account transfer and save system. I loved it when I first started so many years ago but. Now I can't stand to play it anymore. I'd ask the devs or aniplex to make a offline version. But they don't listen to their players anyway.
Thank you for everything you do to keep my game playing. Tamamo Cat is my favorite character in my game. I would cosplay as her.
"Small GB space needed, which is good"
"Greedy,grindy and unrewarding...story is great and that is all! Should have been a paid visual novel."
"This game used to be one of my favourite games , after getting a new phone It seems that I have lost all of my progress, why not implement a Google sign in to make your game much more safer to play and people will stop begging you to return their accounts back so please do that."
"By far the best mobile game I've ever played, and one of the best stories of all time. I've cried multiple times, the story and characters really make you emotional. Character designs are great, there's a lot of funny moments, and the gameplay is intricate, and requires team building skills. I would love to rate 5 stars, but there are major issues. Account transfer system is horrid, gacha rates are abominable, and events need to be reran more or added permanently, as you can miss them forever."
Just lost my account because apparently I can't be signed in into devices?? Dayum. I'm not motivated to start new again because the gacha system of this game sucksü§£
Worst game in history.
"Was a pretty good game. Loved it best part you don't get forced to continue the story events like say the most recent part to access an event if you just joined... My issue though recently has been even playing the game. Since the most recent addition. Thieves or whatever, Dec 16. I haven't been able to log on to go through the safety measure of getting the transfer code or marking down what Servants I had. Every time I try load the game. It crashes. without fail I cannot even play the game."
i heard of it from msa so i give to a try! its my first time playing this
Thanks. The support team is great!
great experience bad gatcha
The app cannot access the downloading server when I am using wifi no matter how fast but I use mobile data i can access it and enter the game.
Good...
"I put a lot of time and effort grinding the items to max my servants out, i lost intrests for a while, came back updated and lost my account. Sign in? They never hear of it, they was transfer numbers, though it's one time use, if you didn't save it and your id numbers (which is not explained in the guides) you can't get your account and have to start all over again"
Love the attention to details with the sprite animation. Nice game to play if you want to see time fly by‚Ä¶ and if your phone is up-to-spec w with lots of memory. Voice acting by actual seiyuu is well done too.
Far too many pop up screens.
"Came for the hype, stayed for the story and characters"
I like this app
"Most overrated gacha in the market. The story is good, everything else is mediocre at best. The developers are lazy, greedy demons. Compared to the insanely high revenue they make monthly, by offering one of the most predatory gacha systems in the market, I see very little effort being put in the game. ‚ö†Ô∏è I warn you the Play Store rating for this game is very misleading. If all you want is the story, read it online. It only gets good after hours and it's not ever voiced."
Terrible gameplay
"The game is good and interesting in general, but the account system is pretty bad. It would be better adding a another account system."
"An Experience that will stay forever in my heart, Whether it was the Sad Moments or the Heartwarming Moments that never fail to make you Feel something, A Story of Meetings and Partings, A Lesson of Cherishing the moments your given, Fate Grand Order is the Game I'll forever cherish in my heart"
"I played for 2 months, lost my phone while travelling. Contacted support. Had screenshots of the game, the last recover code (used one), and gave as many details as possible. They declined my info and didn't give my account back. I'm glad that this happened before starting to spend money on it.üòä"
Noice.
"Update: Got bored again. I just don't have the motivation to play the game, especially the story (I'm on lostbelt 5 part 2). Moving towards 2025, looking at newer release of servants and leaks doesn't really interest me anymore. I guess fgo lost its charm for me. The only thing keeping me playing this game is my favorite characters. I just can't leave my servants. But whelp goodbye for now."
"12/28/24, I am glad I returned to this game but the summon rates... hurt my wallet and brain... All the fighting and nothing else mannn... just to grind for saint...nvm"
"nice game, have a good graphics but the hard part on this is you need too much effort to get pulls and saving your acc, but still the nice turn based game i play so farüòÅ"
"Has the WORST account recovery system where if you forget to make a little tiny code and save it, you could lose your ENTIRE account"
Fix the connection to the download server has been lost bug it keeps looping i have to restart it again to play
"Great game. It has good quality when it comes to the animation, but it sucks when you try to go for banners and not get what you want, spending 330 gems on a banner (11 pulls) and not get what you want but if you want it gotta keep grinding."
I've been playing since launch day. It's still the same game many years later. Finally deleted it. Story was good but the game was never fun.
Great Game
Terrible developer who can't assume their own fault and punishes players for their own bugs.
Can you set some account like link on Google account that way I can play (I keep delete app and download again)
"The game is amazing, btw, I forgot my password, does anyone know how I can recover it?"

I can't believe how hard it is to get one decent file on this game I have cancer and I'm a disability person so I can't afford to buy anything thing on this expensive game spent three days in a row playing day and night restarting can't get one five star character had a file played for a week before couldn't get one then either cancer has been more fun than this game
I really used to like this game. It just plays to slow and the gotcha just has such bad odds. Felt like the odds were considerably worse than a casino and way too expensive
"As a completely free to play player,its honestly not bad, very grindy but it is free and there is always something to do in game"
Easily the best Gacha on the market. It's not even close.
"Great game for FGO fans, but too expensive for me to spend money"

"Pure greed we play because we love the Manga/ anime an get robbed buy waisting time an money getting the same 3* duplicates over and over, over, over, over again it's almost takes advantage of people with gambling addiction like how hard is it to bless your fan based by delivering some better odds on servants! It's not like there is a PvP mode where there would be an advantage of having the most desirable servants but it's hard to get further in the game with spending 100$ of dollars! Spent."

"Story 9.5/10 Gacha rates and pity 3/10 Character and ascension design 7/10 (too many people who look alike ik ik theres a reason for it but damn, can we get another indian pantheon that is not Sakura?) Gameplay 9/10 (I like turn based games) Rewards: 8/10 Materials grinding: 3/10 (still no auto farm. *Puts gacha into your manual mats farming*) Good points: even those low rarity servants are viable and are given buffs. No need to pull for SSR just to clear contents."
Great üòÉüëç
"Nice gameplay, and gives premium cash frequently, but has the worst portrait art I have ever seen. It gives me headaches sometimes. They update animations but not the ugly art."
I hope u make the upgrade system better cuz rn it's annoying and not ez especially after lvl 90 and also put better rates on summoning but anyway I will give it 5 stars for jeanne and saber and arcueid
hi ash
Game crashes constantly and if you uninstall don't forget to write down transfer code otherwise you have to start over and if u spent money u basically threw it all away
App keeps crashing!!!
The worst gacha summon rate among the rest. But at least it's better than evertale game.
Whoever made ecchan needs a raise
Tried it b/c the animes are cool... the game is hot garbage sludge and I'm ashamed I put my phone through having it downloaded on it
SCAM!
I just wanted to give the game a try. Within a day I was getting black screened when opening the app and when it finally resolved i tried to play again and all my account data was gone because I didn't get the chance to make a transfer code.
Cool animations!!
Would be perfect with a less tedious story mode
"It's a really good game, but sadly, gacha sucks. Overall, if you're a Free to play player, you're good."
"It's a pretty decent game. As for battle mechanics, FGO is a great turn-based strategy game. As for the gacha, it's not fun. The rates have improved, but only slightly. And while there is a pity system now, it definitely needs improvement."
"Update of my past review. Hey there I'm still playing. The story is pretty good. I'm waiting for lostbelt 3. Part 2(cosmos in the lostbelt)'s story is pretty good and interesting, I'll be waiting for the conclusion. Thanks 2024update: I just finished lostbelt 6 avalon le fae and it's so good. It's a masterpiece. I hope it gets animated. Also, thank you for always helping me whenever I have problems with my account."
I love the story of FGO. It's so intriguing that we have historical and mythological characters interact with one another. Gameplay wise it's simple so really easy to get into and get used to. Also I love that I can clear the story with low rarity characters and not having the meta characters doesn't mean you can't progress. I love it so much
"Keep crashing since the update of implementation of servant coin and the developers do not take it seriously instead, they fixing the coin system faster which can takes priority later in the game. Ignorant and only care for the profit üëéüëé"
This game not having a way to link your account to anything and no way to get your account back is the worst most unprofessional thing ever. It's been years. Add it. I'm not touching this annoying game ever again.
"Love this game and been playing it for years now, but everytime I enter a battle of freezes whenever I attack, the enemies attack, or if I'm just using a character skill, now it's just getting annoying. Fix it!"
There is no words this is peak fate this is goated
"Laugh,live,love with fgo ‚ôæÔ∏è/10"
I had it lower but finally was able to get my account back still a amazing game
This game gave me a crippling gacha addiction
I just love Jeanne alter and atoria
"Lost my account due to the ""Data Tranfer"" option. This is the second time, and I still received no help from staff for the problem. Hopefully, they can find a better way to transfer data from one device to another, like the options most games have already."
"Lost my almost 2 year account progress.. I played methodically and had all my favorite characters... I had a few lucky top tier pills I had event exclusives that I worked to get .. I lost no money yet the time investment is unreal. These games have no respect for our time all these gacha games and live service games are a literal time/money sink. I'm so demoralized, I uninstalled to save my phone storage space because the phone spyware eats up 85% of your actual storage. Give grace!"
Best story in mobile gaming. It's simply amazing!
"Every since gr7 I just finish of every story in Fate grand order and event but my account transfer it error my password and want my to try again the password but the password that I put on transfer is correct but when I transfer my account in the game it say that please try your password again even my transfer number is new ,I transfer of prepared it in saving my account of new update in the game. Fate grand order is good with the update in the game but the missing is the account is not save"
My favorite game ever!
"We are never getting Maxwell out of NPC Jail, are we?"
"Playing this for 2 years now.... I love this game but sadly even if I give my criticisms about this game, Devs won't still listen, considering that this is just the NA server and it is 1 year behind the JP one... To new players....this is hell you are walking into It's your choice if toyu wanna burn with us"
boring

Ya'll want to make this game to rise from the ashes? Make free ssr every month.
"0 outta 10, love it"
Brilliant story and great variety of servants plus there is help for new players to catch up which has been very useful. Love it
Bug in kana event I can't play pls fix
my fgo account is like my first born child
"This game has stayed my favorite for years but now it's more like a cash grab. Lately I feel like it's an annoying chore to pick up the game and the reason I say that is the lv 120 cap is almost impossible to utilize for most players considering how abysmally low 5 star drop rates are and it seems like events get further and further apart and are repacled with supposed give aways, yet another ridiculous low rate up for past characters, or another storyless farm quest or ""CHALLENGE QUEST"""
"If you're a weeb, just play it, anime waifus, a fun story and all that glorious risk of rolling gachas!"
"i love the game and i'm a huge fan of fgo from toy figure and anime, and I also play other gacha games. the game is nice but i hope instead of pay to win you should just put a proper ads. like everyday there should be a free summon by watching 1 ads like bleach brave soul gacha games its grind to win. I think its advisable to do that because the gacha system in fgo are really really bad and not motivational. and also thanks for fixing the issue about the account log in before."
It's Need Work
"Easy to run on my phone, fun to play, only downloaded because like Saber. Though wish free to play had better rewards."

330 pulls for your wanted character?Welcome to this game.The pity system might as well not exist.Even the guaranteed event 5 Star characters are random and cost real money.So if you want your favorite 5 star at the worst you need 990 saint quartz...they do give out a few but this is ridiculous ..One star for the storytelling.
this game drained me 400$ for just two characters that I wanted and then proceeded to give me two five stars that I genuinely don't want to be on my account for next to nothing.
Great story for Fate fans
Make the Arcade version of this into PC port
You have to read Lostbelt 6 before you die
extremely good at making people hating the game
Love the game but the hero drop rate is disgustingly low. Over 300 saint quartz and not a single 5 star hero. It's not even a matter of rng at that point.
Why is it always lagging? Is there's something wrong with SEA Server?
Mechanics are outdated by other games. Bad gacha game. Very few rewards given to actually pull a decent amouny for the duration of the banner.
"error prompt on data recovery. suggestion to also use google play games as a way to login account back rather than once only transfer number and password would've been nice , can't recover my account now."
Beautiful Anime Girls/Waifus ~ (‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)‚ô°
"If only u could make a sync or something that we can save our acc from log in and using the acc on the other device I would gladly rate it to 5 star since the story and easy game is great also the servant but the only problem for me is the sync , can't sign up my acc for a better purpose if I transfer it to another device."
Tutorial too long and too much pop ups was bored already because of how long the tutorial was
S tier not counting the transfer system this game has No downside Other than the grind but it's not hard
What's the point of having anniversaries for rare characters that not everyone has locked behind a paywall? Not everyone wants to waste money on pay to win games.
Grinded this game out for a year and still haven't gotten a 5 star unit. Just deleted it. Will never play or recommend this game
Great game if you love fate stay anime
"I really enjoy this game. The battles have some tactical qualities absent from other gatcha games, there is a story to the campaigns and other side missions. I also love the characters I have always been a big Fate fan. I am only voting 3 stars because there is no auto features for daily battles. The grind is pretty big in this game and gets very boring when you can't automate some of the fights."
Hate demeter
"Trash game, update your account system, lost all my progress because you can't have an account. You only exist as a ""transfer code"", phone crashes and your cache wipes? Guess what, all your progress is gone unless you saved that transfer code."
Fun
I'd let oberon do me ngl
Best storytelling in a gacha! But worst gacha rates of them all...
This is game is so woke! What if Fate Grand Order was called WOKE Grand Order and the characters were proudly apart of the lgbtflatscreentv+ community!
"Not a bad game overall. Bulk of the quality lies in the scenario writing and characters. Gameplay's sufficiently deep that you'll find new things useful and new uses for old things sometimes. I'd advise a new player to invest in their mid- to low-rarity Servants, and to be carefully calculated with their material usage. Drop rates for materials are so low as to make mistaken expenditures almost disastrously bad. (This has been marginally improved.)"
full pledged gambling.
"EDIT: The game is good. I love the characters. I love the story, and I love how the player is the main character. But the drop rates are the worst. The more you process, the harder will be the drop rates I deleted the game because out of 60x pulls, I got no 5* servant, it's not right, and kinda a scam =/ 3/10 for drop rates altogether. The game is good, but the gacha is not"
"A slow burn of disappointment. It was fun while it lasted, but the longer I played it, the worse it got. The repetitiveness of it all, the lack of QoL mechanics, the unforgiving gacha, and the obsolete gameplay that makes Chess and Solitaire look advance. The few redeeming qualities are the story and characters, everything else is tiring. It took them 10 years to update 1 character and make the Command spells refresh daily. TEN YEARS."
Great game I like it
"If youre a fan of fate, you probably need to play this at some point"
Fate fan
Exceptional story. Kinoko Nasu always delivers strong feels on top of the action. The lack of PVP makes it the only mobile game worth playing.
"10/10 for the story, gacha rates are horrendous but you don't need any 1 character to be in the ""meta"", and NA server is 2 years behind JP server. I played this game years ago and had spent 10k on an account that didn't transfer when I switched phones. I'm starting from scratch and it seems theyve made some new progress with the games dynamics."
It is good but I say the need to update more often
The gacha rates are terrible but I'm still fan of fgo series. I just wanna get Nero or the good servants I wanted. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
All I got were measely 3-4 star summons. Waste of my time. Outdated looking game
"Best gotcha game out there. Graphics are amazing , pulls are amazing, events are awesome. Getting characters in events is really awesome. Some items are hard to get though, I played a rider daily this morning 40x , used 4 stones and didn't get 1 dragon wing to drop. I need 20 of them."
peak everything
This game is hardcore no auto play no account connect.
Absolutely perfect
"Little consistent SQ, very bad for current event."
gacha is hell
"The gacha for this game is horrible! You have to summon 330 times to get the guaranteed, and it does not carry over to the next banners, they simply reset :)"
Needs an account transfer system. Not a one time code.
"I have been playing the game since I was a senior high school student. I love the game and all it's aspect. Now that I'm a forth year student, I have to do all my duties and responsibilities. It's very time consuming. Now that I'm very much busier than I was before, I made a grave decision to STOP playing the game entirely. It's not that I hate the game, but as what the game stands now, I don't think I can spend a few more hours playing, even sparing a couple of minutes is difficult now."
"gameplay and story is good, but the problem is no auto battle, every gacha games i play has auto battle feature but fate go is the only one who doesn't have auto battle, i will rate 5 stars if they add auto battle"
Very nice
"Fate/Grand Order is one of, if not the worst top-revenue gacha game in the industry. And just for one single reason: It's stagnant. It all boils down to a simple schematic of: If money get, then why do anything? And it's been like that for years, repeating ad nauseam. Gameplay - same exact thing since release; characters - flavor of the month; story - just watch on YouTube. It's not worth playing. The biggest crime a game can commit - be worthless, unless you are someone with sunk-cost fallacy"
It's not a bad game but the drop rates for materials and of summons are horrible. Then it's hard to even get to 30 crystals so when you get thos crystals that you worked so hard for them do a summon it's like all that hard work was for nothing. It feels pointless to even try.
Cool but can we get a 3d fate game
My wish has been fulfilled.
Awesome game. It's fun using characters from history across time and using Gilgamesh and slapping people in the face with enuma elish. Though getting a specific servant is kinda hard even when they have increased pickup rates.
Ugly
"This game legit gives gambling addicts a run for their money, and that's exactly what I like lol"
‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Éé Ô∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
Always says failed to connect to the server even though my internet access was okay
"As a dedicated Fate/Grand Order player, I've truly enjoyed the immersive storytelling, strategic gameplay, and the vast array of Servants to collect. However, one major drawback has been the lack of a background downloading feature for in-game updates and data files. Currently, downloads require players to stay within the app, making it difficult to multitask or take breaks without interrupting the process."
It crashes every five minutes and if I'm in battle it crashes even quicker..... I love the game but the crashing is getting really annoying and I tried disabling web view and clearing the cache but it still does it.
I can't play the game freely this loading and connecting takes hours even when your play the loading thing will appear any time and will stay there for half a hours even kicking out on the game fix your game cause this is one of the best gacha game I ever play but have worst bug
Good
This game is surviving on its IP alone. It's quality of life features are abysmal.
Nemo is my captain ü´°
"Is goooood. I like it, but hoping for increase rate up!"
"For Fate fans I recommend you play this game. I can see a lot of complaints about the transfer system, which I agree it could be much better. However there is hope, in the JP version of the game you are now able to bind your account. This is likely to be implemented soon to global, but I don't understand why they haven't done it sooner."
"Love the game. It's a bit hard to get five star characters, but the storyline is really detailed and engaging making the player want to keep playing. Four years later still playing. I still love this game, and its amazing storyline!"
"Highly unrecommended The game highest package is 80$ While the japanese version is 60$ After lost belt India the game story becomes more than 10 hours reading with multiple parts with more than 10 hours , not respecting player time The rates for pulling are awful and the pity system is cheap Has multiple mentally illed npc and we are expected to ""respect"" that nonsense"
Fun well round the clock great story line great player base great communities and very engaging. Dropping one star got gypt for a summons full rotation and no compensation. The overall experience of getting that featured unit even being denied due to a bugged interface gave me a unpleasant playthrough.
"I've been playing this game for some time now, and in recent months, I've noticed the drop rate for 4 and 5 ‚òÜ servants has dramatically decreased, especially for event specific characters."
It has a great story and fun turn based combat and you can even transfer it from one phone to another 1) enter the game 2) enter my room 3) issue transfer number 4) open game on your new device 5) Before entering the game in the bottom left hand side of the screen press data transfer and enter the number you got at step 3 6) enjoy the game on a new device

One of the best story ever told and I can't belive it's a free mobile game
It's so good üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ Percent the goodest
"Gameplay is whatever, but the characters and the lore are the best. Fate is completely carried by its characters and lore. That is why people are so loyal to this franchise, and why they sell so much merchandise! The people that run this franchise are geniuses honestly. I wish Square Enix ran Final Fantasy as well as Type Moon runs the Fate series!"
This game is very addictive the combat itself is meh but the other parts of the game are addictive af
TF is imput password is there any other way to transfer data without using password since I'm the only one who knows I can't transfer my data because i didn't even remember any password
"Free to play, no ads, and fun to grind"
"I love this game and it's story and everything about it but, I've lost my account 4 times nje because your stupid account transfer number doesn't work. I've payed money over and over to rebuild what I lost. Now I've lost it all again because the play store uninstalled it itself and I lost Saber Alter, Avenger Kama, Lady Avalon and more. I'm done."
"The game itself is meh. Kinda boring. But the gacha? Most cash cow gacha game ever. The pity for a five-star is 900 summons. That's 30 ten pulls for a single pity hit. For scale: hsr 90 genshin 90 zzz 90. Dokkan 100 or 200. As you see from most major gacha games, it's not a massive pity. But 30 ten pulls is insane. This problem is still major even in the JP version"
Love the game!
"All the money this game is getting, and still outdated asf, still abysmal rating, even the rate ups is barely noticeable, the story's is getting stale the more time pass by, at this rate your just robbing the poor faithful fate fans here, nasu should have not let lasengle milk this series"
Compare to other catche games that I've played. this game has the most ridiculous low drop rate.
Nice game it's really interesting and so fun
Fun :3
"Great story, nice animation. Summon system is totally unbalanced. Had 600 bucks to spare which was about 330 summons. Didn't get a single 5 star character and 7 4 stars I got was all the same one. Don't spend money on it, only use the quartz you get for free."
1* for now. Imma return it to 5* when the lag is fixed
"Despierto, farmeo, despierto, farmeo, etc. Juego de mrdüòø Porfa, traigan el modo autom√°ticoüêí"
I came back played all the way to the Avalon lost belt and I'll be completely honest I don't like it one bit.. I don't want to finish it I don't even want to look at it. It's just unhealthy.. I got to the fight against Albion and just lost the will to keep going.. Maybe I'll regain it but I doubt it.. I really wish there was a way to just skip the Avalon belt completely it's just not worth it. The Greece lost belt had fire it was perfect.. You should have just ended the belts with that one..
B E S T G A C H A
used to be fun interesting but lately things became more tedious boring and chore also poor gacha system and rewards neat storytelling storyline individually characters are great sometimes their existence was a bit odd doesn't fit at all especially their designs some are now copy and paste with minor tweaks it's getting harder to distinguish them
"I really love this game for overall, especially the plot and how historically-based it is. I only gave 4 stars because of the low gacha rate in each banner. I spent around 200+ Saint Quarts just to always get 3-star CE. It is really hard espeically for a F2P like me."
Wonderfull
"Regular player since launch in 2017, with 2000+ days logged in. There are many I like about this game, but there are far too many deficiency compared to other games to recommend this to anyone. Account system has been horrible since launch, pity is 300, and does not carry over from 1 banner to the next. Developers keep increasing the importance of servant coins, but will not add any additions methods to acquire them except whaling even harder. I've wasted so much time and money on this garbage."
"The game's not really canon to the actual storyline, it uses a style of summoning never used elsewhere, it honestly feels like a fan game. Someone stole my phone, and when I tried to get my account back, support claimed there was a discrepancy despite me giving as much information as I can. I paid over $1,000 to get a four star. Don't waste your money on this game, if you want a four star just restart for it if you can. Or just don't play, the art is all online."
"Game is rigged in such a way that it can only be completed if you drop big amounts of money, everything is locked behind paywalls and the game opts to use fabricated difficulty (Bosses that have ridiculous amounts of HP and broken OP abilities) instead of actual fun challenging fights in order to force you to buy, events that provide ""free"" Servants (game characters) are also locked behind story completion (which as mentioned can only be completed if you buy.)"

I just reinstalled this game I had to make a new account forgot my other account password and other thing gun game very long lol
Send you to quartz store. Says it's 0$ but then trys to charge you 80$ beware of this scam filled game.
The game keeps lagging and closing itself
Full of armour.
Whoever decided to lock the Halloween event behind Olympus should be fired.
"Horrible transfer system just lost my account, and this is after I already transferred to my new phone. I un-installed the game, and when I re-installed it later, it had forgotten my account. Also the way to get your account back even though it's very precise and helpful, it's horrible if you aren't a constant player because it forces you to remember every little detail about your account and if you don't play constantly like me you won't have key details for the recovery of your account."
"I just want more Saint Quartz, my guy."
"FGO is just a miserable gacha game, and probably has one of the worst rates in the industry that isn't just a dumb cash. Most content requires paywalled limited meta units. In terms of the gacha aspects, the game is very far behind a lot of the competition. Spent 3 years on this game and it's just bad. At release it was mid, but it's not only very bad at this point, it's outdated and even more exploitative."
Re-installed the game... I forgot my game account transfer. -_- If only I could bind my account using GMail or any Social Media account.
The best game ever but i really hoped that will be there audio in the storyline
Pretty poggers
"Used to love this game, but now it keeps crashing every few minutes. Please fix"
"Great game. An amazing story, engaging characters, and simply gameplay."
"Aside from the guaranteed gacha and very occasional Servants that I want, I do not want to spend more on this game again. Even with their current pity system, it sucks to pour your savings just to get what you were looking for before pity. Rates need to be better and have a multi-pity system. The two stars are for the story and graphics."
Nah lasengle we got some beef now why did you not give me van gogh üò≠üôè

i like game
"I really like this game, but i think there should be a way to pick the survents that you want to summen at least from the general summoning pool or having the survents that you are having a hard time getting added to the friend point summoning pool and I think there should be a way to get the special ascension materials using QP or in the shop if you weren't able to get enough during past events same with banner servents or only have the the pictured event servents available to get for events"
"Love the game and everything with it but it needs a better account transfer, I lost so many accounts due to getting a new phone and forgetting to save the transfer information"
Gachagachagachagachaaaa~
"Battles not loading!! Without battles, game can't advance. Bug introduced within last 8 hours."
Why are you trying to advertise this game as a new fate game when it's this old lmao
"They really have to better the pull rates, its crazy that i ended up paying $85 to summon 6 times all to just get 1 (4 star servant ) thats ridiculous."
"It really is a game where the servant chooses you. One single multi, just to get the rate up summer Raikou and guess who shows up? Van gogh, that's who. Gameplay wise, it really has aged and not in a good way, but the story makes up for it and then some. Not many gacha games have had stories that stick to me like fgo. I think the closest is CounterSide and HSR. Even then, while I got invested into the game cause of those stories, it didn't hit like FGO. You could feel the love put into it"
"It's good yeah but quickly it becomes pay to win, also game doesn't even save data in cloud nor on your phone, cause randomly boom all my 60 hours of progress gone."
This is the best I will never forget this game
"Despite having a strong mobile data connection, the game takes long to load then disconnected every end of round"
At its best when it's unhinged
With the amount of money and fanaticism being poured into this game it's crazy how little the devs care about their players. Almost 10 years on and your account is still at risk due to no Google account sync. Pity is still disgustingly high and doesn't roll over. Servant coins only got increased when called on their bs. I'm in it till EoS since I've sunk thousands of dollars into this game but I don't recommend you do the same. Go play a game that respects your time. Story is excellent tho
"The rate up sucks and is predatory, gacha should be banned"
Artoria best girl
That's hell you are walking into
The apps instability is getting worse. I have tried to play on two separate devices this week. And the app keeps crashing. Especially when I enter or exit the saints quarts summon menu. This game has had two additional years from the japan release to make it run smoothly. But even my newest device can't keep it running.
"Playing it mostly because of the IP/characters, as far as games go though it's a gacha game with little depth in gameplay/mechanics, notoriously bad gacha system, and mediocre story... I would only really recommend it to fans of nasu."
Everything about the game is old and outdated and the devs think this is fine. It's been years. Grow up devs you know you're earning money without doing anything and that sucks
moriarty my beloved...
"Been playing for 5 years. Van Gogh is sexy. Thank you, Japan."
"Since they change the dev, everything goes awful"
"The story and general gameplay are really good and engaging, plus the cast of recognizable historical figures and nasuverse characters are fun. My only complaint is that the gacha in this game can be harder than in others, especially since this game has a very poor sparking feature."
This is my first gacha game. I loved this game but the transfer system make it hard to get your game into another device which can make you lost all your progress. What a shame :(
"Love the game, but lately I've been getting kicked out of the game four to five times in one session. I've got kicked out repeatedly just playing normally and have to reopen the app to continue. Is this a bug?"
"the game itself is good, its just the reviewers thats making the game look bad because they have skill issues or bad luck"
I like this game hopefully
I dunno I didn't finish the game..
Delete
The game can be fun but it sadly is not as fun since the servant rolls are terrible. Not a great gotcha game either. The story is good but whats the point when you can't have your favorite characters join u.
The games good and all it's just mainly that there a lot of boring grinding before anything interesting and the gacha I may be unlucky or something but yeah the gacha is I would say worse than genshin but again I might just be a hater who's unlucky
"It has some of the best stories I've ever read, alongside some of the worst gameplay I have ever experienced."
No data sync it's useless when you can't transfer your data please update
No link to g account makes game trash Better hope your phone won't break plus the junk is expensive
"Story: it got collection of stories and the good thing is almost all of them are good. I even have my own faves. Characters: solid art, interesting characters Battle system: i have no problems with this but if you hate randomness or similar to card shuffling, you might hate the battle system. Great animation scene for np or their special moves/attacks. Pull rate: yes you can play for free I have no problems with pulling not unless i want duplicates."
Best damn game I ever played cannot stop üò§ üôå
Bootiful geym
"This game has high chances of putting you to sleep within minutes, it's so boring."
Sucks so bad
Dont do it people
SAO KIRITO SWORD ART ONLINE AND I CAN GET A GOOD TO LEAVE THE SAME TIME TO I CAN I THINK IT'S NOT A GOOD I CAN GET A GOOD SENPAI MOVIE WITH YOU HAVE A I THINK I THINK
"Great game,the quality is top and I love the characters (Barghest)"
Great game and I also like the story.
"This game needs to be updated. It was one of the best gachas out at the time and had one of the best stories. Now though the story is okay and the gacha rates are beyond trash. Games like HSR pushed gacha forward, we don't need to be able to get every limited servant as f2p but I've had years in between getting an SSR in this game. Events are same old, same old. Real story content is few and far between. It feels like they dropped an anime and stopped caring about the game. Please catch up."
"""That's hell you're walking into."" This gacha game is notorious for its terrible pull rates and horrible gameplay. In fact, its so bad that a wiki is needed to even properly understand how this game works. What draws people in is the story, although Nasu(the writer of Fate) only started writing the story(and making the story actually good) at roughly the sixth chapter. The art and soundtrack are phenomenal, enhancing the incredible story, but the gameplay is so bad only a two stars is given."
Gameplay looks like its from 2005 still no auto
"It's fun, easy to learn and hard to master. For a gotcha game, it does not require any of investment to get through the game."
Pretty damn nice game!
No just no
New streaming and video guidelines are stupid as hell. Should be reworked immediately or only apply to Japan. Sony is an inbred company ruling over these. They can't handle any criticism and want more money. Ending clairvoyance this way won't even work. Do better. Use your brain.
Absolute peak!
"epik waifus of history. The story is the biggest draw for me. In a mobile game you ask?? Yes, in a mobile game. I won't get deep into it but it's story you can really sink your teeth into with characters inspired by figures from history, folklore and religion often taking place in alternate history takes on the real world. The alt history loving weeb in me is absolutely in love with this game. My bank, however hates it."
"I've been playing this game since year 1. But when my old phone died and I couldn't transfer my data to my new phone, the fgo support team provided great customer service. 5 star maybe not to the greedy gacha system but to the support team!"
"By today's standards the game is very dated, but it is still as solid as gacha games come. The game has great and engaging basis and very high-quality tie-in multimedia, all thanks to the overall setting. I prefer the tactical turn-based combat over any idle games, and the sheer amount of characters is pretty much unmatched. Story has some wonk, but is often very enjoyable and silly. The ingame currency is quite expensive, but the monetization scheme is not predatory and f2p is fully viable."

Great game. But please improve the save data and data link features ü§£
not recommended it's addicting
The story becomes more interesting the more you play.
"This game is such a mixed bag. It expects you to finish an insane amount of content to be able to participate in events, yet most of that content is terrible. The few chapters that are good, are great. The gacha is terrible: ‚Ç¨30 for a 0.7% chance at a jpeg, with no grace for terrible luck. The art is also an extremely mixed bag. And the grind... I think this game mostly remains afloat on the visual novels of old. It really needs a major overhaul to be more friendly and fun, but whales ruin that."
Kasu tagal mag loading ehh I'm sorry üòêüòê heheh
"Great for older players quite abyssmal for new players. Some events to get premium currencies are locked behind main story and there are a ton to get through, you're guaranteed to miss out on some events."
"Add data saving, I lost my account with so much time into it over an accidental uninstall with no way to get it back"
"Used to be decent, but outdated, tedious, and the devs don't seem to try anymore. Played fgo since it came out on global like 7 years ago, and despite all it's flaws like slow loading and dumb grind, I liked the story and characters, and the gameplay was passable. However, it's clear the devs are not going to be putting nearly as much effort as they used to. Animation updates are no longer happening like they used to, events are just grind fests. Don't bother installing, it's too boring now."
Used to play all the time. I do not use my phone as much anymore. It would be nice if they had a PC version.
Still the best mobile game I've played
"pedophile L. so many of the serious parts of the story are actually just ridiculous. still play it tho üòî i think I'm in a toxic relationship. im one of the people that likes the drop rates being so low for 5 stars, but who is a 5 star and who isn't makes no sense. there should also be a trade mechanic. i do not want my np2 summer musashi, but it'd be a waste to just get rid of her. I don't understand why Hindu gods are added to FGO but they wouldn't dare add someone like Jesus. It feels racist."
Slow loading
"The game is good, it's just time consuming when farming for materials maybe add a skip or auto batte if a certain condition is meet."
"I love the game, tha graphics.. all, but can you please add some of our mythical creatures in ta game? Just like the Bakunawa or the Minokawa etc. Love you guys. Thanks for the game."
"No event, dried up, no free quartz.Barren wasteland."
I've been trying to play the game but it immediately crashes when I boot it up
"Needs a better transfer system, they need to take into account people losing their phones and when that happens you LOSE all your progress"
I love this game
"I've always loved fate. I'm a free to play person. I've had this game for a little over 3 years, and I love it."
The loading screen time is so annoying. It makes you want to stare at the loading screen for about 30 seconds before you start to play the game.
Masterpiece
"Great game only if u can stick to f2p and are ok with disappointment or if ur ok with spending lots of money. If u prefer exciting games for f2p or are ok with $5-10 here and there then there's better games out there, playing f2p or spending a few dollars here and there u will most likely get disappointed as the only way to guarantee a 5 star is making around 380 wishes in a single banner, no carry over and no guarantee for a single event 5 star if you don't hit the 380 in 1 banner"
üòçüòç
Was able to recover my account with their help after losing it.
It's all White Washed.
"As a Fate fan, F/GO is the oldest gacha game I've been playing on and off since release day. Although not as predatory with its monetization model like other new and better gachas, the loyal whales are what kept this game running for a very long time. Being a decade old game, I loved how devs still went out of their way to rework the skills of old units, making them useable again which most gachas don't bothered to do. In addition, the story doesn't become good until you finally reached Camelot!"
amazing VN. terrible game. it takes a lot for me to drop a game after 6+years but this one managed it.
Account transfer is terrible
"This game is beautiful but the problems is the connection in your servers are too much long how many seconds to play in match, in claiming items why did you fix this issue bullshiIt's"
If you can just shut down this game please keep popping up all your stupid advertisement
"Love the game and the story but farming is too hard considering that there's no auto mode, every fight is manual and it gets boring when you fight an enemy over and over again just to level up a character,at least put an auto mode on farming."
Lol WHAT A MONEY WASTEüòí
I absolutely loved this game. It was one of the first mobile games that I actually downloaded. But alas the dilemma of a new phone and losing all your progress. I almost didn't download it again because I didn't want to start over. I literally just lost almost 10 years worth of gameplay. Please fix the transfer system for Christ sake. I'm gonna give it a go but I just feel like because of the loss I might just done with this game
Combat system is one of the best I've ever played on a mobile game. It's engaging and is both simple (usability) and complex (strategy and team building). Way more fun than idle combat games.
"Great story, Great characters, Has a kinda mid gameplay but is still fun. Gacha gives you the most dopamine cause pity is incredibly hard to hit and requires you to save up for months so you are stuck praying to RNGesus to grant you the blessings to win that 1% chance"
"I've had it with this service, the god awful gacha that is genuinely affecting my mental health, I'm not doing this anymore. All you people care about and want is my money, and you don't give a damn what happens to people, so long as they empty their wallets for you. Over 30 tickets and over 240 quartz, and you couldn't even give me a lousy 4 star servant? ""But what about the gameplay and story?"" The gameplay is just pressing buttons, and you can watch the story online if you care that much."
"It is fun and also having the chance to slay, and also be in a adventure"
"Fun game but terrible with getting 4 and 5 star servants. Fate Grand Order has been reported to have made billions in USD yet the spawn rates are unacceptable. Less than 1% chance of 4 and 5 star servants and the only bones the developers give you are by completing the fuyuki singularly and the initial new player summons. This is greedy, you have made a lot of money. Can't you be fair with the spawns? I shouldn't have to spend hundreds of dollars for one 4 or 5 star servant."
Please change Artoria's name back
very good game with over 700 charachters very good combat and visuals the voice acting is also amazing
Love the Fate franchise? You'll love the game too. Would absolutely suggest!
best g√¢cha game ever
Best mobile game of all time! Edit: I am in hell
Great
Peak game but the rates are ABYSMAL. You can grind a lot but once you've extinguished the resources you're gonna slave away until the next update. Well I haven't spent over 10 bucks on this game but it's pretty aight. Hope they keep releasing peak characters.
Great game BUT PLEASE ADD a google play/gqmes binding system!!!
10 apologems aren't enough for what happened in the Tunguska raid.
This is a very cool game. Since I started playing this I really liked it. But what if you can play offline but you can't choose support servants and can only play campaign? I would be really happy when this is gonna be added.
I'm having a blast with the game I won some 5 star characters and didn't spend a dime on it and I'm on the late game now which is more amazing
"The story is really good, if you have very little patience or get bored easily I think you won't like the start but still really good for my opinion, especially the prologue for the Lostbelt. Gameplay wise... good, not bad but not too good. If you have a lot of free time this is a pretty good game to spend your free time."
This game is fun but give you biggest gigabyte or files plss this is not good at the biggest file because cause you to explode your phone beware
Keep crashing
"Please add sweep in daily quest where we can skip the stage that we already beat, it's kind a redundant and boring doing the same thing over again"
I love it
"I was enjoying the game until it suddenly failed to connect to servers. Tried reinstalling, restarting and finding other solutions online and nothing seems to fix the problem. I wouldn't mind this problem if you can secure your account but no you need a transfer code. For a gacha game that you can spend a lot of money, the security is so bad not to mention how buggy the game was."
masuk nay lama gila anj****
I use to love this game and I spent almost seven years with it only to lose everything! I got bored of the events because they became complicated and despite me sending information that could get me my progress back I was told I couldn't. I worked hard on my servants that I bled money and tears only to lose it all!ü§¨
Bulok ayaw gumana
Oisüíïüíï
heavily pay to win game. enemies are hard as the story goes on and you are stuck with limited resources to level up your servants
Awesome game. Its been a year since i started playing and i can say that it improves a lot with new content Edit: lmao its been 8 years since i started playing. I really love this game. Especially the story
Very good combat mechanics. Gacha rate is trash. Gacha pity is a joke and whoever thought of that is retarded.
When I would like Shiki Gorgon and Rider Martha well I can't have it that's unfair
My best game.
"Awful, outdated Ui and graphics, stingiest most greedy gacha game on the market. Terrible game"
My last review was a jike lmao im still playing the game..
Forgot to review this one for a long time like 4 yrs ago. This game is my first of turn based type game. The story is really great not just bcoz I'm a fate fan but it is really great.
This game is the best game in the entire universe AAAAAAA. I love Gilgamesh. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Good game but I accidentally deleted the app and my account is gone
"omg I love this game! The story is well written, the characters are likable and the gameplay is fun."
Not a good game too much lag and loading
"a wonderful game with a great story. However, if you don't have your transfer code and number then when you uninstall the game it won't remember you. So goodbye to the time and money spent on this game as if you don't have it then it will only reset you back to the very beginning of the game. game needs a link account to really ensure that it doesn't happen again."
"It's a fun game with a lot of stories and servants to collect. As a fan of the series, I am invested in the characters and story content. I love all the different art styles for the character cards. The only negative is that grinding can be a bit monotonous, and the gameplay gets somewhat repetative over time. The story does do well to balance that out. Overall, I would recommend it."
Customer service is terrible. They'll palm you off and literally just tell you they don't care about your request and they'll get to it when they can be bothered. Don't even care if you've spent a lot of money on the game. They just don't value their customers at all. Absolutely disgusting practice and I would honestly look into other games. Or at least a game where they care about their paying customers. The account recovery system on this game is also bloody ancient.
Great game for Fate fans! Only cons are no auto and events being locked behind story progression.
me like fate (proto arthur animation update and buff when)
Terrible gacha experience. The only gacha game in the world where it gets harder and harder to get an ssr.
"It's fun, but 900 st quartz before you can get the gaurantee? What the f-? That is the equivalent of playing 2700 free quest missions. Either make it way easier to get st quartz, lower the prices of it, or make it like 400 st quartz for the gaurantee. Because that is actually horrible man. Do better. Other than that the games okay, it's just annoying I can't get space Ishtar because shes gonna cost me the equivalent of 300 hours to save up for, and there's my even 300 hours left on the summon."
"I lost my first account a few years ago. I had a good high ranking character that I obtained. I was saddened by the fact I'm no longer able to take it back because I lost it code that was sent to me and the costumer service aren't even acknowledge my request to find it. Welp looks like playing this game might depressed me further so nope, not playing this no more"
"So I'm gonna say this, the story's good, the arts different for many servants it's good but there's a bad problem they never fix or plan too. The one time transfer code, you could copy/paste it, but somehow the game still messes it up. I been playing for 2.5 years and I appreciate the customer service being quick truly I am! I just wish the transfer system wasn't what it is, wish we could link it to ANYTHING else like google play to help save data. That's why I hate using it, it's risky a lot"
"Damn, I lost all the files and then never recover again"
"Great game and awesome story, but the summon rate needs fixing"
"Recommend to anyone. Something to notice on. Rolling for characters on rate up is... not friendly. If chances of rated up characters showing up can be changed to higher frequencies, that would kick this game to a 5-star instead of what I believe it to be a 4.7-star."
Fun game and amazing story.
"Drop rate is worse then most games, I don't know how much I spent just trying to get 5 stars characters. The story of this universe is what kept me playing this."
Arjuna alter
As an Fate series fan I like it even the events for summoning üëçüëçüëç
"The game itself is fun but the ""Rate up banners"" are a lie its just a specified pool with the same drop rates and yes you can throw nearly 200 saints quartz and not get anything better than a 4 star craft essence which there are more of than servants in the game so expect that a lot. And the amount of saints quartz you have access to is extremely limited unless your willing to pay $12 for 18 of them."
I been play from 2017 and now when I want summon 5 star you need to pay hundred of hundred quarts just to get one 5 star servent hopefully they change a better summon roll
"I know I put 5 stars, but I'll tell you that after the 9th anniversary. It should've had a huge update on Ui or Overhaul. The fan base is easy to bend over for 120 Sq."
TERRIBLE PULL RATES TOO MUCH TIME TO GRIND AND RESIST OTHER BANNERS JUST TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY IN THE GAME CAN NEVER GET WANTED CHARACTERS IF POSSIBLE WANT TO GIVE THIS HORRIBLE GAME 0 STARS ABSOLUTE TRASH GAME WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY FATE FANS IT'S NOT WORTH IT PLAY ANY OTHER FATE GAMES BUT THIS SUMMONS RATES ARE TERRIBLE GOT MORE CRAFT ESSENCE THAN CHARACTERS USELESS GAME WITH IT'S USELESS GATCHA RATES ZERO STARS RATE DON'T PLAY STUPID GAME
poor gacha chance
Edi
Gacha is still the same. Dogwater like always
It's pretty enjoyable
will crush your hopes and dreams :)
"The game was enjoyable and had a great story, it's steadily getting back to a more interesting plot"
Need a way to refund append skills to be able to use servant coins for lvl 120 if you want to.
This was a 5* but now there are constant crashes. If you have a Note 20 Ultra it isn't even playable. Devs have said they might fix in November which means they're fine with players being unable to play for over 2 months. There's no excuse for this on a game that's rated highly.
"Best cash-grab gacha game!!! Theres like 9k different saber styled servants and 9k different rin styled mages and servants lmaooo, they really milked their most popular characters!!! How shameless yet it works soo well!! Karna >>>>> Gilgamesh"
Just a fan of Type-Moon so...
"Been playing for years. But its time to review it. Outdated system. Zero fixes. Small Updates takes months. Fixes if ever also takes months. Gameplay us outdated. A lot of ""recent"" systems are also left unattended. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
Este juego me arruin√≥ la vida.
"Events are too grindy for the minimum. They keep forcing more time gated grinding like 4 star Fou's, pawprints, and level 120. They tripled the timegated grails to max a servant. You cant max 5 star servants without pulling 10 copies of a unit now for servant coins. For lower rarities its it's worse. Constant freezing never fixed. Once my favorite gacha but it's become a blatant cash grab and time waster. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It died years ago and is now a mocking puppet of it's former self."
"Pretty solid RPG, good story, decent gacha rates but a very bad pity system when compared to others like it."
"I'm a Fates fan. That being said, this is a mediocre gacha game. PROS: Many servants to collect. Different ways to earn quartz. Some combat anims are cool. Simple combat, but subtly complex. Beautiful art. Many events. CONS: Poor drop rates. Expensive to buy rolls. Early servant anims still not fully updated. Neglected skill upgrades for certain servants (1-3‚òÖ especially). Basic story anims/cinematics. Very grindy, no autoplay. Freezing and stuttering. Need more ways to interact with servants"
I lik
Still draws me in after years of playing.
That's hell you're walking into.
Story good. User experience terrible. Art okay. Very very expensive.
-Expensive. it does have a pity system; HOWEVER the cost is RIDICULOUS! it costs roughly $431 for it to take effect. -it's rare to get apology quarts or free servants. -Bad timings. The games events are usually short and the event summons ONLY last as long as the event lasts which is very dumb imo. -Good Story. the story is very good and one of the best imo. but there isn't an auto play feature unlike other Gachas. -Their Anniversaries suck too. have to pay for the guarantee SR & SSRs.
Game is absolutely good but I give it 3 stars because after some time playing the game will freeze or crash and it'll force close itself.
"Incredibly amazing story and characters with high quality artwork. Unfortunately bogged down by one of the worst gacha systems and very slow QOL changes. It's hard to suggest FGO to new players because event reruns are scarce and story clear requirements for some events are ridiculous. The pity system is a joke and the lack of a pity system for 4* servants is awful. Based on the JP server 9th anni, it'll only get worse from here. :/"
Been playing for years now and I still like the turn-based mechanic of the game and let's not forget that the Fate series servants are well designed. A very very good game to all fate fans ü´∂üèª
Update not working?
"Best experience on 7th anniversary, all my savings and patience were answered.. I got more then I want. Hopefully it'll be the same for next target banner"
Great game love it ^^
I really like this game to be honest. I hope Lasengle releases more male servants. I'm collecting husbandos afterall
"Didn't get Skadi Summer, life goes on..."
Great game. Have been playing for years now. Just wanna say that this game can be done and played f2p if you're willing to grind and burrow other player's servants. Takes time. Even f2p you'll be able to save sq for 5star hero/waifu that you'd want. For me it's a well balanced game for f2p and p2w players. Cuz its a win win for both.
"7 months in fgo, yet I only have 1 new ssr servant. Make the rate up higher"
"Approved üëç,One Of The game that I Like to comeback even I was Bored of this game but the game keep Attracting me to Play this game again..."
Good game.
Very good game
"Thanks for the worst summer in fgo, spooks everywhere on rate ups killed any motivation."
"5 Sao l·∫•y luck quay gssr anniversary, ko ra SpIshtar th√¨ 1 sao."
"Very good, but new characters"
I recently decided to pick this game up again but sadly no backbone controller support :/ plz fix this!! Way better if it worked. I will change review when i can use it.
One of the best games out there.
Ganda talaga ng apss na to
The newest update on the JP gives me no hope. That's 2 years away so it's best to quit now and save yourself the trouble.
"Do better, this game is years behind literally every other gacha"
"Fate Grand Order is a game I like a lot but I am giving it a 1 star review after seeing that the developers from the Japanese side actively refuses to improve the game in meaningful ways for their 9th anniversary, instead opting for more predatory practices to milk money from high spenders. The Servant Coin system was already bad. Now a 5 star needs 8 copies and bond 15 to unlock all features. Do not support this."
"Decent story decent gameplay, but the biggest issue guaranteed now is servant coins. Which are an item needed to unlock passive skills and level them to 120. The amount you get is pathetically low and they force you to gacha more copies of units that provide no benefit after hitting NP 5. They have stated that they are aware and working on it. But it's been 2 or 3 years now I believe? But have yet to do a single thing. EXCEPT make you roll more copies for newly released passives. DO NOT play."
Great story the gatcha tho is bad like really bad I feel as if you need to spend ages just to get anything good but that's ok since the game practically throws the currency at you so saving to do 100 pulls isn't too hard
They made append coins worse.
This game took and decimated my life. Do not play this game. I mean it. Happy this is finally in the UK store. Why can't I rotate the screen? I don't have auto rotate turned off so why can't it rotate?
"I'm done playing. I am tired of all the issues with the game. I can't even get into the game now. I'm just done. Don't bother downloading the game it's not worth it. Trust me, you are better off finding a better rpg game to play."
Good game you should try it
"Okay one complaint, just account accessibility, ive reached out through a previous email chain used to recover previous. If they cant recover my account im sad to say ill have to put it behind me... though if i get it back i can easily see myself spending on it again. Im also in favor of linking acccounts with google."
"50+ rolls nothing but craft essence, not even a 4 star servant, nothing but hot garbage. I think it's time to take an indefinite break"
"Bad rates and grafics are so outdated, story is great but its held back buy awful representation of the scenes, they should try to make the story more visually appealing and accurate to what the dialogue is saying, to much reuse of old sprites, Dead game"
"By far the worst gacha system I've seen, 960 crystals to guarantee only one copy of a 5stars and after that good luck getting another copy, honestly I'm happy i only paid once for crystals cause buying crystals seems worthless."
Outstanding character designs. Awful grind. Free-to-play get a miserable amount of currency. Play another game until a new Fate game comes out.
"Amazing game, 5 star worthy. But account recovery sucks. I lost an account a few weeks ago and sadly can't recover it because I can't link it to google. And restarting is extremely difficult."
"No gacha game is good. Everything is done to make you spend more money as you support a predatory system. No one should be recommending these games to new players. Predatory monetary systems aside, playing these games is simply an inefficient use of time; they are incomplete games and have incomplete stories. FGO is no different. Its story, touted as the best among gacha, is mediocre--subpar if we consider games with decent stories. And its story is its selling point, FGO's gameplay is atrociou"
"The story is boring until like Singularity 6, but once you get there you're golden. Especially once you get to the 2nd volume of this game. Sadly you can't skip to the good part though, or else you'll be missing critical plot points. It'll be worth it though, the creators had a massive evolution over the years and are creating banger after banger. My Top List: Lostbelt 6; SE.RA.PH; Saber Wars II; Imaginary Scramble; GudaGuda Yamataikoku; Tokugawa Restoration Labyrinth, Ooku; and any summer event"
"They brought back Magia Record's gacha game, now it's Magia Exedra."
Best game
This game is a scam alright never ever waste money to this it will never be worth it

"Typical mobile game, with good backgrounds from Type Moon."
"Honestly, it's the best gacha game of this generation. Bless your rolls"
Fan of Fate shows
Game has the worst gacha ive ever seen. Sad cuz the game is actually fun but a gacha game is only as good as the gacha itself.
"The way you handle the game, players, and mechanics is very old. No permanent pity, not enough rewards, too grindy, and subpar graphics. You can't just remain the same because you generate money. You can improve. I'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE 2017 AND I STILL DON'T HAVE MERLIN AND NOW LADY OF AVALON. I STILL DID NOT GET HER AFTER 600 SQ. I SAVED SO MUCH BUT TO NO AVAIL. Compare your game to Genshin and Honkai Star Rail where there is permanent pity and good graphics. You've become too greedy, F/GO."
19x loong rerolls & still NO SKADI RURER
"The best game I have ever played so far. I just started playing it a while ago, and I'm gonna be honest, it was amazing. The designs are great, cool gameplay, and the story is also really amazing. The best game ever. I highly recommend this."
rigged.
"Hmm quite well enough. Comparing the gacha to other gacha mechanics, this game might seem a bit lacking. Otherwise the story is top-notch and so is the gameplay."
"Played for 6 years, 2000 log ins, it's time to stop. It has the worst gacha. 500 pulls in 8 months, could not get a new 5*. This being allowed to happen is unacceptable."

Recollection quests are not fun at all.
Changing review. Forgot to do this ages ago but I got my account back.
Story is the good part. Gacha is worst. Barely a pity system requiring 330 summons aka over 900 quartz aka 480 US dollars. And when you hit the 5 star early ends the counter. Pity doesn't carry over at all. I'm still here due to sunk cost fallacy
"I like almost everything about the game. The story, the characters, the animations, and the music. The reason why I gave a 4‚òÖ rating is because this game doesn't have a sweep function. I know this game is old, but I hope it'll get the sweep function someday because it's really time consuming if I do every event stage one by one. Especially myself, a newbie who played since July 1, 2024 is struggling on doing these event stages repeatedly without sweeping them."
Beautiful game

really good.

"SSR Rate wasn't 0.8%, it was lower. Even with pity, it was only 0.3%. I've been running out of SQ to roll and the drop rate was merciless to years old players like me who played the game for 5 years. It's like they want to see f2p players suffering. It would be great if they make 3 months per GSSR. Many players like me and my friends can afford that much GSSR but not 3600 SQ."
"Gacha without any auto battle mechanic, but the gameplay still sucks The art style and animation reminds me of adventure quest in how bad it looks, but without any of the charm"
Recently got back into fate and I managed to recover my old account with all my data saved so FGO best game!
"The font size for the dialogues are good enough and is actually useful for a game that has lengthy story dialogues. However the UI/User Interface feels very outdated, the gameplay itself is fine. And also saving the account or account back-up feels very outdated, players should be able to link their Gmail accounts or Facebook or other accounts to cloud save their progress. The game has in-game purchases not being able to cloud save with Google account feels very risky."
"Truly the worst gacha on the market. It makes sense why they continue to lose business to competitors. Story is solid, fair amount of content to keep the game reasonably fresh after so many years. But the gacha is simply abysmal and takes away from the experience. Update: still accurate in 2024"
Everything about this game is good but the draw system 330 summon?! My whole quarts is drain rn and please add auto battle
When I deleted this game is shows that I still have it so I dont like the game
Great game
"This game desperately need a better pity system, its painfully bad. I would genuinely rate this game 5 stars if it had one but spending seven hundred quartz that I earned from playing every day to get literally nothing I wanted is just insulting frankly."
'speed
"Didn't even get the chance to play it. Just spent ages installing it for the first time just to see ""account suspended"". I was really looking forward to playing this. Uninstalled."
"Please fix, whenever I open the game it crashes nearly immediately."
This game is for ppl with good luck xd
Yeah thanks for the video finally i can update it here to
Ever since i started playing other gacha games i'm now comparing this one to those games. Rates here are terrible and fights can sometimes be boring when farming. But awooga homina homina homina amirite? Like an abused lover i keep on coming back.
Play the game buy quartz get a new phone lose account and profit sounds like their business plan
Sync account when?
GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA
Dog pop poo
Booba
Nice Game (I'm just kidding)
"Gacha rates atrocious; no major updates, just a lazy and soulless cash cow nowadays"
"Eh, the sexualization of certain characters is a bit much at times, but the story is rock solid, if a little convoluted at times, as should be expected of anything carrying the Fate moniker. Gameplay is fairly intuitive, though it's worth noting that while the designers try to keep each Servant 'balanced,' their focus is always on narrative first. So some 5 star Servants are rather wimpy, while one of the game's best supports is a 2 star. Also, check your room for Servant dialogues. Worth it."
I want to say this game is 5 star worthy but with the way the gacha is with no pity system and low odds it's really hard when you reach the late game and don't have stronger servents to help carry you along.
"It's pretty good. Gacha still sucks, though"
"As much as I give all my love and 5 stars to this game, there is no options to buy Saint Quarts for us non US players. I am now put into a position where I am forced to be free to play even though I want to open my wallet. Come on guys don't region lock this game thats cruel."
"This game clearly shows its age compared to more recent gachas, but it's also still a fun gachas game if you're a fan of the fate series. Also waifus for laifus"
Just gacha rate is kind of a lie
Terrible gacha pull
Be careful you might get addicted to gamble sq.
What is the meaning of Unusable User Id? I can't play this game answer me please üò≠
Having so much fun
Gacha system has been bad recently
"Yea, I have 1000+ consecutive login streak. I think I like this game, gacha is hell though."
"I've been playing this game for nearly five years. The game is a staple on my phone. I have decent luck with the gatcha. However, I have also spent enough time that I have solid characters. I recommended this game if you want something both engaging and (generally) simple with anime characters."
The gacha has claimed me
Great fun for over 2500 days of play
summer broke me
"This is by far the best gacha game I've ever played. You don't have to put money in, but you'll want to because it feels worth supporting."
"I don't know if they hate my account but every summer event , my luck will go so badly until I can't even save up for any more banner and the content they decided to made it so hard that the player can hardly play"
This is the kind of game I want to play..to practice your patience...
"Changed my review but, it takes a lot of patience and grinding beware. Def fun tho"
"I mean, im still playing this game after 6 years. might as well give it 5 stars while im updating it"
"i love this and been playing for a long time. the problem is that when i try facing Ebon Deer, my screen always freezes and kicks me out of the game. i tried clearing the caches , i tried uninstalling and re install I again but i still crashes . please fix this . im trying to look for another game that can replace Star Rail but can't find any. this game is so great that i can't stop playing it . please fix this."
Game loz
I wish for Auto Farming in this game for things that isn't story mode related
"I am getting bored in this game, maybe because it is pretty slow to progress (on stages and why do I need to beat the stage 5 or 3 times lol). There is no auto function, repetetive, and there is no skip. Rewards are okay. Gacha is pretty fair. I'd recommend this game for those who are patient players and a super fan of FATE."
"The overall story and characters are incredible, always keeps pulling me back whenever there's an update. the only complaint is that the drop rates on 5 star servants could be better."
"Don't know why anyone would even want to play this antiquated piece of garbage. Terrible animations, bad art style, no auto, horrible rates, massive cash fest, and boring story."
I love the game
"2 years of playing, 3000 SQ, 100 summon tickets, and I only got one Archetype: Earth Thanks Fate, very cool"
Takes forever too load cant even open the game
This game is absolutely amazing and I love it
"All though repetitive, the game makes up for it in long story dialog and large amount of characters to select from. Events are plenty. Back to one star because the account recovery process is really painful. Every time you switch phones you need to make an account recovery key to pass your account to the new phone, but this makes it so you can easily lose your account if you lose your phone."
I dont really like giving 1 stars to gacha games since i'm okay with everything but I would rather play 7DS grand cross than this because I can still log into my saved account than yours.
FGO JP has a better gacha rate up than FGO NA.
Love
Is the worst game ever every every time I want to play Minecraft the thing pop up I can't even not play
"A classic 7 year old gacha game on Android. It still has the best story for a gacha game, popular characters, fluid animations, tons of collectibles, events, etc. The community is pretty great and there is a lot of content to go through for people new to the game. It is dragged down by the repetitive gameplay so it needs an auto mode for events. This is gacha hell, the pity mechanic takes far too many pulls to activate. I ended up trying most gacha games and settled on Nikke."
Best game ever made
"Update: FGO GSSR has tricked me 3 times, hence the two star review. Absolutely no new characters lined up. Nice storyline, but extremely hard to get the characters you want. I'm currently facing a 7 month drought with no SSRs and will continue to face the drought. GO AT YOUR OWN RISK."
Nice game ain't gonna lie 100%
"It's a good game, easy to understand. But when I deleted the game because it wouldn't open to reinstall, the account that I have been playing for about a year or two got lost and I cant seem to find a way to recover it anymore. It was really disappointing since I had decent amount ervants on the account."
My save file got corrupted and the games has no google save or other link account what a piece of trash.
Been playing for probably about 4 years now and the only things that would make this better is if they added English voice actors and my only complaint is that I used around 400 saint quartz on the 7th anniversary archetype earth summon but still didn't get the limited 5 star servant from it not sure how many draws that equals but Its a lot
The dev is like hermit who never come out of their cave to see how much QOL the other games have improve so far. They just don't want to improve their player QOL at all. Auto farming should be add long ago by replay the last successful run of those stages. Not even talking about ridiculous pity. Only Fate die hard fans remain in this game.
"The story is good, but the rates are awful. Just absolutely not worth putting any money into"
The latest updates have made the app very unstable. It is constantly crashing on me. I can't play for more than 5-10 minutes and then I am back at home screen.
Lost my Shiki banner
"Its really weird in comparison to other gacha games. The fact that this is one of the most popular games is a mistery to me. The content is so bleak, you dont get any gems at all, like u have to grind 4 hours just to get 5 essences or dupes of mid ahh chars. Even with lvl 70 I just dont understand when this game will give u stuff to improve. And when will the missions ever be fun? Improve on this outdated greedy ahh system PLEASE."
"Way to many banner for a new player almost all of them are p2w, ui is clunky loading is slow"
"Gameplay is boring, forced to use certain characters, insanely greedy monetization like paid only banners etc"
This is beautiful game very
"A fantastic game for fans and new fans, easy to pickup, fun story. Loooots of reading, but some people love that."
Love the story
"Just not that fun, fate as a series is cool but this game i my opinion is just not a good way to experience the series. Rates are so low, games very microtransaction focused just boring as a whole."
Amazing
Don't play this game. It's gacha mechanic sucks that it's frustrating as hell.
Super good graphics and the effects
I love this game and I got moon cancer on my first spin thank you so much for that
It's my type a game but loading screen longer than 2 seconds everytime u click something icks me.
"PecfectionüòÜ game......i would like you to update some good auto-mode in the chaldea gate only....the only diary quest farming exp, qp...."
I love saber (Artoria Pendragon)
"It's a fun game, and I like the turn-based combat system. But my gosh is the gacha absolutely terrible. The pity system - if you can even call it that - is so high, it may as well not exist. And speaking of the in-game currency, they are NOT generous enough with it. They've improved since years prior, but they still have a long ways to go."
"Love this game, but I've been getting either 'server is too busy' or 'maintenance is in progress' since noon. Even though it was working just fine earlier. It's starting to get on my nerves"
Can we please get a server expansion or something trying to get on and just keep being told server issues please be patient
They should separate the summoning of Servant and Essence so that player could easily distinguise which one to summon
"Lovely designs for my favorite characters. I live their charm as well. I feel very connected to characters through interludes. Very cool stories as well. This game never fails to entertain me, it can only get better and better."
It's very fun and enjoyable.
"Update: While I love the characters and story, I just can't recomend the gameplay. Its tedious and at times specific servant gimics are required. Events are no-life farming by hand. Its a lot of work for a game, especially a mobile one. I'd rather just spend my time playing something that isn't a constant chore. The only reason I continue to login is because my friend loves this game. 5 years later and no change. No auto farm or English VO. But there's paid quartz pulls and server busy errors."
"I played every day for almost a year and they won't let me back in because my phone got broke. Don't wast your time energy and life with this racket. Hello Knoxville Josh Thank you for your message.

"Love the game and been playing for years. Great story characters and scenes. The issue I have is I pour so much money for characters even after being free to play for years. So sad when I never get the character I'm searching for even on ""Rate up banners"" so now will be back to free to play and not spend any more. Finally saw a banner for someone I've wanted for years and poof, a random 4 or 5 star I already have or didn't want."
400 GEMS AND ONLY GET TWO 4* SERVANT
"TIME TO LOCK IN, ARCUIED IS COMING"
it's okay imo just seems like honkai impact 3rd. also the grind just like honkai impact 3rd for summoning material.
"Love this game (this is the only staple F2P game I've been playing for since I started on 2018). Almost lost my first account, but was able to recover it via Support when a friend advised me to (after a few months, thanks Support!). Summon rates are too strict so you might complain not getting SSRs servants, but I'm enjoying the lore so far and can get by with my servants."
"It's a great game to play. The story is excellent. Though there are some bothers. One is a better way to ascend our characters which goes into the next one. Add the skip feature/auto battle feature. It'll help players greatly by cutting time and gather the required materials. Or increase the drop rates higher or guaranteed when completing the quest. Guaranteed drop rates, I can understand going in manually. But with the rates now, it's better to add the skip feature."
The game is great. the only problem is that you always have to transfer issues whenever you change account and I personally lost two of my account
Great story and characters just wish you didn't have to grind so much
Could no longer transfer my data
This game has a horrible problem with crashing and just makes it incredibly hard to play due to crashing everytime. I can now barely get past the start screen as whenever I try to switch to another area or do a level the app crashes.
"If you're already a fan of type moon or just a casual fate/ fan, I'd recommend the game. The story is probably nasu top 3 greatest. The gameplay is although simple and get complicated and deep depending on how u want to play. The only thing I'd say is that one of it's down fall is the fact there's no way to link your account to easily save your data. Leading to a situation like whether you delete the app or phone breaks, then it's basically gone unless you email typemoon about it."
best game I've played this year
"Love it, im knew to this game and i already have so many characters i enjoyed the story the rewards are balanced so keep it upüôè Also a quick question When are you going to make a moba fate game? Moba is so popular this days come on ill support you many times just to see a moba fate games like ml wildrift or hok"
"Good gacha game if you like VN's or a fate fan, gameplay is fine for how old its design was and the developer are trying to do much of it."
The game is not nice you'll always lose your account and in 330th pull to get the character you want
one of the worst games I've ever played.
Cool
fire game
"The game's visuals are aesthetically pleasing, and the gameplay is enjoyable. However, the repetitive nature of the game may lead to a lack of sustained interest over time. I have been playing the game since its inception."
"While I love this game, I feel I have to lower my grade. Every time I try to load the app, I'm met with a black screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing fixes it. I'm very disappointed. This is will also be my fourth time restarting the game from scratch because of the transfer code thing. PLEASE just let us log in with our Google accounts!"
So I just paid for a 3.99 purchase in the shop and when I pay for the quartz it kicked me out the game and when I try to go back in it just has me on a black screen.... YOUR GAME RIPPED ME OFF AND I WANT MY REFUND BACK I DONT NOT WISH TO PLAY THIS GAME ANY FURTHER it didn't even let me save my data and I just started playing a few minutes ago.. I want my refund
The only problem is that there's no sync thing
"Game is old, no update, getting 1 crystal for each quest is terrible and the gacha system is terrible"
"If your tutorial for a game like this extends past one mission you're doing it wrong. You shouldn't send me on a tutorial, force me to start the story, force me to summon hero's, force me to create a team and NOT let me even choose the team. Then proceed to force me into another mission. Maybe that's the end of it, I'm not sure. I un-installed purely off the principal that the developers assume I have an IQ of 5 and can't figure anything out on my own."
"i love this game I have no complaints at all. the animation is great the characters are the best and the story line ties together all of the series. the only thing I would ask the maker's is please ü•∫ make it so the player can choose the look there character or the look of there command spell, and another event but with the opportunity to get characters from fate apocrypha like seig, Siegfried, Mordred, jack the ripper, astolfo, and others please."
Greatest mobile game of all time.
"Nice game, great story. Horrendous gacha system. Would get 3 more stars when male servants get summer servants too"
"Great game, but BOY the start dash campaigns are just straight up insulting to current players. ""Look at all this stuff you guys don't get cause you're already fans!"""
My game keeps on crashing since the last update please fix
A fun and awesome game for fate fan's Lots of lore with new and old servants
"gameplay is boring, took so much time to finish a mission..really boring edit: the gameplay were no longer boring, because I can't even entering the dungeon without freeze/crash, 10/10 would recommend to dying people"
Horrible rate
"Whenever an enemy dies and it still has the same character card the character won't just attack the next enemy it will continue to attack the same one even tho it's been defeated, it's also really difficult to acquire resources to summon for new units not to mention the bad rng of the game."
‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å
Although I don't like games with gacha or energy mechanics I do like the game a little better than most of the games I've played but this game badly needs a auto battle mechanic or a end battle mechanic and a better way to get accounts back üôÉ
"Although it's one of the OG gachas and has nostalgia, the missing QOL features that are standard in newer games really sticks out. (No persistent pity system, no batch/auto grinding) Especially since Global has 2 year of clairvoyance and knows how the meta is defined. Compared to people with full rosters, I can't imagine the pains a new player would have to go through without key supports."
The game is great and entertaining
So burnt out and repetitive gameplay
We need a better account syncing.
Im have trouble with this game it keeps freeze on me even in story mode fix this issues.
Not a bad game
"Slow Story, Old UI, Super Boring after a while.... I've heard interesting events and fights will be there when you progress the story, but as a new player in the early game, I'm super disappointed."
Lacks most common QoL features that others Gachas have. Dupe System is fundamentally flawed due to poor rates. (At least among Servants.) Lack of bundles. Pity system is fundamentally worthless unless whaling or skipping almost several months' worth of banners. Unregistered Spirit Origin system is flawed due in the same way as the Dupe system. No Skip Battle Option for Stages you've already done for easy farming. Did I mention there is no account linking as well?
Best gacha
Fun game as long as you know what you are getting into.
One of the only fun games with a story if you like turnbased
I wish I didn't walk in to this hell of a path...
"Rating 4 because i love it but droppimg the star because NA team literally makes spelling mistakes, changes names for no reason and they mess up in copy and pasting code from JP. How does that even happen?"
Love this game
7 years in.... That's a long time.
you dont give me SSR for months i hate you
How to give 10 star?
Fix your damm game
"The drop rate is trash. You might have 900sq and get nothing, or a single ticket and get the servant it's so stupid"
The sea of gacha games that have come out over the years have really shown me how good this game was. I don't even care to guess how many games I've quit playing but I still play this one because no matter how many games I quit or how long I go without playing this game I come back to it. For new players there's loads of content to get through and EN server is lagged behind JP server you can be sure there is plenty more to come. It's even possible to plan for future unit releases.
"A visual novel with terrible gameplay between and after every srory node. Pity that doesn't carry over and requires 300 pulls for a single unit, outdated animations, sprites and design philosophy in general, a waste of time in most cases, since you are required to repeat nodes time and time again, with no incentive to experiment or even use most of your characters. New enemies that make old units obsolete and reward you from having duplicate units, by saving you time on beating nodes faster."
"My personal experience. . . since I've swapped from my cellphone over to another device, performance has been smoother, and look forward to enjoying upcoming events. I appreciate the time and patience staff put into customer service, and the enjoyment this game brings me. Saint Quartz aside, and that is expected, Fate gives me inspiration."
"It's not letting me play. It keeps saying, ""Software wasn't launched properly."" I've deleted and re-downloaded it several times, including clearing the cache - which is recommended - however, it still won't work. Also, the device should be compatible because I played it on this game a few months ago, and it worked."
i need auto save Ac
"this game is pretty fun if your into the fate franchise, but they should keep adding events and it would be better if the game was 3d just like the arcade version"
"This game overall is very fun, co zidering that I'm a Fate series fan. The only problem is that the servant rates in summons are way too low. I've spent hundreds of hours of spare time trying to get the 5 star characters, but with no results. Other than that, it's a fantastic game."
Love this game + they fixed the crashing issue
It's good to play but please increase the remaining turnover to higher limit from 7 make it 10 . And please realise all the legendary warriors from summoning.
"OTP system isn't OK.. Using Transfer Code is too outdated Players can bind game acc with their Gmail in CN server.. So, just make NA same.."
First off here is a warning if you play this game make sure you write your transfer code down and all your friends name on a piece of paper in this game and a list of all your servants you have. Also keep a record of Everytime you log in. Because if you get a new phone like I did and can't log back in and you send them an email and if you don't remember any or all of that they will tell you they can't help you and it's not enough. Take screenshots and keep a record of everything.
The story and the char is perfect
"This is one of the best games I've played. Apart from all the crashing, this game is really good and recommended. A low wait time and actually good storyline. But we should add Public chats."
Bad
"It's very enjoyable, yes the game is pretty outdated in terms of gameplay but the characters are Fantastic and the game has a pretty wide range of characters from pretty boys to pretty girls, and even mecha and big muscho men I love this game and it brings me joys that no other gacha can give I hope this game continues in the close future"
Constant crashes on my samsung s22 ultra.
"Mann I did love this game but with the app taking too much storage space has become too much and asking to get a new phone is wild. Alot of people( including me) not including a list of problems that I'm not going to mention out the goodness of my heart..it's too much to ask if you want to play this game, in my opinion you're going to have to play on the computer cuz most phones are no longer going to be able to have the storage for this. rip phone users. It Was a great game."
Melusine goddess
Not a game with offline tasks but good if you like anime and reading. Gacha RNG can be terrible and events are grindy as hell lately. There is a pity system for summoning five star characters but it requires a lot of summoning materials as opposed to some other games.
The Best that's all I have to say.. PEAK!
"Had 1 time an god spin but crashed. I lost my quartz and my summon, but great game."
I mean it's alright
Ritsuka the Goat!
This is not a gacha game. This is the materialization of all that which is evil.
SSR rank experience
The best game ever played
Needs auto play even if its just for event farming nodes or lotto events or at least don't require players to farm too much just to clear event shops. Farming for event currencies and lotto tickets is not fun its far too repetitive and feels like a chore. Most players can easily loop now I don't see why y'all have to make it unnecessarily hard for players. Most gacha games today have auto play or simply doesn't make it hard for players to get full event rewards.
No auto still in 2024
"Amazing and rich story, weak at first but it develops into one of the best story from all times"
i still got disappointed on FGO pity system i save 3900 saint quartz from farming
Story is good
"Make our account link to any social media app like twitter,fb yahoo or gmail , so whenever i re install my game i won't have a heart attack for DATA LOST and should be. Install in Multiple Device like if u have 2 phones incase 1 phones low battery or shutdowns completely"
"Playing Grand Order because it seems like I'm messing out a lot of characters and lore, keeping up the fate series. Sad that I've missed a lot of events, still have very long way to go. Locked events, guaranteed only ONE* SSR*5 in 330 SQ.. pulls.. Short dialogues, grinding, events.. Kinda disappointed it looks far, FAR different from the anime itself. When the dialogue starts to get interesting, then suddenly you heard the soundtrack and you know it sucks."
"We cool now, the game is back from it's greatness! Except for the fact that I still don't have a new five star since 6 months ago."
"Fun game with a good story and characters. The roll rates and amount of currency you receive are abysmal. Even when you purchase currency you dont recieve much. It is almost impossible to get all the characters you want, that are 4 star and 5 star."
Foreignerbros...why can't Molay be real? I need a part alien goth gf that is plotting to end life as we know it and I'm the only being between us and total annihilation. Why can't she be real bros?
Oberon
Lost my 6 years of stuff and been playing email tag and still waiting for my transfer number üò≠üòû
I realized by trying to play without spending money you get to a certain point. To where you made it so we have to spend our own money. Or we can't get any good characters. That takes the fun out of it for me.
Got Oberon
While the gacha might be unforgiving but it still has a wonderful story and enjoyable gameplay.
With the game crash all the time when I put it in the background (even for less then 10 seconds) or use irl money. It makes me want to play it less and less
It a game I got Dioscuri and I proud of it
"I kinda wish I could play while the system is being updated. It would be nice if I could play on alternating days and the your system update would have something new to record on alternating days. Whose schedule is even amenable to waiting until 2am to play? People with no lives, no friends and no jobs. You want some players to get so into it that they spend real $ , you want people to share the game with friends who have $, but people with jobs and friends, can't play because of your hours."
almost got my astolfo to lvl 120
Use all saint quartz to spin didn't get ssr would do it again 10/10 game
"Solid story and characters, but the material grinding can be very tedious."
"Fate Grand Oder of Aids. This game is being hard carried by the Fate franchise. The story in this game is almost pointless, since the main character never dies, your servants never die and every problem will be solved by fighting alone. The gameplay is extremely grindy and your energy is painfully limited. The png characters are not worth the time and money. Seriously, go outside or play a better game. Don't eat dirt."
Fate is the greatest story in fiction
"I rate this hell hole as 5 star . Once you go in , you cannot turn back üëçüèª"
Trash game.
All my SQ. Gone.
Wish they would get with the times and provide a better way to back up your account other than a id number and password
Very grinding... but good story.
"This game is so much fun to play! Every time I fail, I just get stronger and smarter! The gacha system is good, and the balance of 4‚òÜ and 5‚òÜ cards and characters to other cards and characters is very clean-cut and smooth. Everyone can get every character or none of the characters. Me, I get lucky from time to time and get the characters I wanted. Edit: Still very good, the story can be tear jerking at times."
greatttt
Very enjoyable game and alot of beautiful Art work.
But still getting alot of C.E's
"Love this game, Is awesome"
Pray that your game doesn't crash while attempting to summon heros. Otherwise you'll lose the currancy you spent but not get any rolls! Tried contacting the Devs to maybe get a refund but they basically told me to go F myself.
"Awesome, fun, and engaging game. Beat the entire game, and I have to admit, awesome storyline. Amazingly accurate when compared to the anime, and much more balanced than other games of this type. If you're not winning, you can just do one of the constant events that are popping up and learn new strats. I'd recommend this anime game to anyone."
"I've been playing fgo since 2018, and this game frankly sucks. Some of the worst rates I've seen in gacha, slow qol updates, (It took almost 10 years just to get a bad pity system implemented) 2 year time gap between servers, outdated game engine, insanely boring core gameplay loop, ridiculously grind heavy. There is no incentive to play this game outside of Fgo having the best gacha story or outside of being a Fate fan."
"Man, I just like Astolfo what else?"
Love is you
Doesn't have auto pilots like the others games üòï
So I had a previous review that I posted that was incorrect and I deleted it so I could correct the mistakes I said in it the game's crashing issues seem to mostly be on event maps and things within the events. normal game play in things not realted to the current event seems to be working now
"Garbage, can't even fix ui and loading times"
"The tutorial is stupidly long with no option to skip, it's a turn based game there shouldnt be an hour long tutorial on what to press this is actually stupid"
The best mobile game I played on jp it's awesome
"I love the fate series, and it's a game that plays very while."
Good game!!
I love history and now I can play as history characters and the campaign is so good and you get a daily gift for in game money and I like the feeling of when I beat a hard level and I will give it a 5 Star ‚≠ê ratting and the event's are also super good to play and I liked the newest one yet.
Waited a couple of hours to load but seem to be stuck at the connecting screen.
PEAK üî•
On the ad it said that I could get a free ssr rank but I didn't
Very good experience.
The app crashes when starting up and black screen of death while also starting up plus the currency was trash since you have to rely on friendship points to get new units with no way save ur data might as well not play
"Good game, just kinda getting tired with the controls, or just the game in general. There are literally other better games than this but nonetheless, still a good game."
It's a great game but as of right now the server seem so laggy nowadays sometimes I have to wait for hours just to progress the game.
The odds of me getting two unfeatured SRs in one multi on a limited banner is literally lower than getting two copies of the featured SSR in one multi. Will still continue playing
They dont carry pity over which sucks.
Basically doesn't work if you have a samsung s21 which is frustrating. Will bring the rating back up once they fix this.
Great game it's just that it crashes most of the time probably depending on phone model (in my case I use a samsung j4 plus) hoping that they'll resolve that kind of issue or otherwise the only probable way to smoothly play this game is to get a phone model that is a much more advanced
"I do want the Holy Grail but I'm not a fan of these Grail front events. The first one, The land of shadow Grail front, that one was okay it was a new experience. Now each year they're releasing these new Grail front events and I just don't like it because there's a limited of servants and craft essence you can use in those type of battles. If I'm not in the mood to play those kind of events I'll just sacrifice the Holy Grail"
trash drop rate
"Still a great story, but the content has been going downhill for years. Less reruns, longer events, skipping seasonal events, etc. Also lacks qol things that every other gacha has, and the ""pity"" is abysmal and broke the banners which made 4* servants way harder to get. Also hostile to new players, as you miss out on lots of good free units and events that you have no way to access anymore. Great story and characters but it feels like a gacha from 2013"
"I've lost 2 accounts to the embarrassingly outdated account recovery system which requires you to keep track of a long list of niche and specific details which you wouldn't be prepared to answer unless you knew you were going to lose your account. Considering the decline in story and servant quality over time, it's not worth the hassle."
My favorite mobile game ever! So fun and with lots of events. Edit: It's 2024 and I still feel the same way!! C:
I wanna recover my old account if possible the only thing I remember is my id
How is this not multiple platform?
"A game completely carried by its title. Gameplay is repetitive & completely reliant on whaling. For a strategy game, it's extremely simplistic and gets boring quickly. No auto, terrible loading times, no pity system, no way to save accounts on FaceB or Google Play, and horrible rates. It's a money machine more than a game. Anyone who says that this game is good is either a fate fan or a complete brain dead whale. 2024 and it's still bad."
just bad for the mental.
"Huge fan of the series, the servants are so well designed. And the story is awesome. I will say that generally pulling high ranking servants can be tough, but they aren't really needed to beat quests. Game also can be hard, but super fun"
So many 30 summons nothing gained. Fml
"Amazing game with an incredible storyline, one that i keep coming back to, keep up the good work!"
"People wouldnt play this game if the characters weren't fate characters. This game is boring and doesn't care about ur time and money, this is all you need to know about this game to stay away from it."
pls tonelico np5
"What is it: The main story functions basically like a Visual Novel with turn-based Rock-Paper-Scissors combat as the actual gameplay. Otherwise, it's a Gatcha game. The story is pretty by-the-numbers early on, but the writing improves after the first few chapters. My only complaints are on how unforgiving the gatcha is with drop rates and how slow Lasangle is to update animations. The game is almost 7 years old (10 for JP) and it shows on a lot of older servants."
That's hell you're walking into...
"Great game. Fantastic story, wonderful animation and just all around fun to play."
Great to fantastic writing chained to the frustrating gameplay of a live service gacha game. Just find a way to read its story elsewhere.
it has a good story and for everyone complaining about the rates some free units are literally better than a decent amount of srs and ssrs
I want asclepius
"The abysmal gacha rates can be intimidating, as a FTP (Free to play) player, I find the wait for a new servant to be part of the fun. Using only the servants you're dealt is part of the challenge, and I find it more a fun restriction than something to mald over."
Enuma elish!
Fun game wish it would stop deleting my account after a long hiatus xc
The backup system sucks! Can't recover account once you lost the transfer code. And if you ask for help with customer service they ask you questions about your player's details you couldn't possibly remember all if you left the game for a month due to burnout. Why can't we have email and password like any normal game? üôÅüò≠
June 2024 update is Forcing me to quit. Game Won't work anymore at my tablet ü•¥üò°ü§¨
Forever Toxic Rolls
"An in-game notice announced a new update that lists snapdragon CPUs as the only compatible CPU for Android devices. I reached out to support to clarify if all phones with non-snapdragon CPUs will no longer work, and I received an answer saying they could provide no more information than what's on the official website. I have no idea if my phone will still be capable of running the game after the next update."
I like the game and I play for free but the problem lies in that you can't save your progress if the app is deleted a fatal flaw but no game is perfect.
"Compared to gacha games nowadays this game falls behind. Banners requiring 330 pity for featured 5* that does not carry on next banner is just as good as not having pity at all. No auto battle/sweep or any way to quicken the slow grinding. Worst of all, there's no account sync to Google, Twitter etc. The game's mechanics are too old for this era and they don't bother updating it. If it wasn't for the name Fate that's doing the carry, this game would have been shut down a long time ago."
Good I am not ai
"When was Koyanskaya of Light's banner going to appear? I lost 50/50 pity to Koyanskaya of Dark, so I kind of need to know when the banner is going to appear again."
I rage quit this game more often than i would like to admit... The gacha system sucks in a complete different level. It should be illegal... The story and characters are great tho... It's the FATE saga after all.
Easy to burn out on but still love the game to death ‚ô° just take your time with it and save up for who you like the most!
Good game üòÄ
Worst game with outdated combat and quality of life changes that takes forever. Makes you grind with the worst combat system in the game. Play if you want to but understand that the only redeeming quality of this game is its story and thats it nothing else everything else is a waste of time. Still believe the above but the team helped me get my account back. Process was overall simple and the team helped me get it back within a few days.
I've always lived the fate series and the take on historical characters. Especially now that so many of my ancestors have joined the ranks. I especially appreciate the adding of Charlemagne due to the fact that he is in fact one of my ancestors that I can draw a straight line to. Would be nice if I could summon him. However I understand it is a game of chance.
The most frightening is they dont have cloud cause lost account and using code once only and rechange code again is pointless
"Rating has gone down to 2*s for gatcha rates. If I sped the equivalent of $200 in summoning materials, I expect at MINIMUM to receive at least one Sr, preferably one featured on the banner, not 30+ craft essences that I will never use because they aren't one of like 5 meta essences. It has by far the WORST rates of getting characters that I have ever seen in any gatcha game ever"
Fantastic story and very diverse roster... honestly though the one thing holding this game back is its absolutely horrible rates... for context. The pity in this game is 300 rolls. Ive played this game for 6 years. And even i cant think of a reasonable viewpoint for that. Especially since the game only gives about 420 to 450 rolls a year. Meaning at BEST you get 3 pity every 2 years
Time to say goodbye to the game i've been playing for years. Their gacha mechanic is the worst in all the games i've played. Loved the characters and the story
Add Auto battle.
"not only is this game fun and has amazing texture and designs,i lost my account 3 days ago and they got it back in just 2 days!Really love their support and the game"
I lost my account why does this game has no google account linking
Fgo is the best game i've ever played! But the developers have to fix stuff especially when it sometimes stops working. Like when I played it the other day it freezed and lagged like if something was absolutely wrong.
"Been playing over almost 3 years, and the story just keeps getting better. The events are pretty funny and dope, OST are damn good, I've got no problems in summoning an SSR because I'm just pretty lucky I guess... (there are times which is not). Ive also had no issue on this game, to me it looks good.üíú"
The saint quartz system is kinda harsh but once you really get into the game and you know what's up then it's not too bad. The storyline is amazing and events give you something to do once you're caught up with the latest chapters which gives you a good chance at a good read and in-game currency to save for any servant you wish to summon in the future
üòé
"Game does not work on my wifi, even though I have internet"
After the latest update the game is crashing constantly.
"My favorite mobile game for years, only one that's managed to hook me tbh."
Astolfo is very hot and the only reason I downloaded this game
Perfect
"The rates are sucks, best to play other games if you're not a fate franchise fan"
The Gatcha aspect is bad... let's just make that clear. But the overall game isn't that bad. You can make do with 4* Characters and there effectiveness is about equal or greater than some 5*s. Team building is somewhat complex.
"Love this game for the battle strategies. For all the gacha games I've played, this is the most fun and most rewarding. I'll be here for a while :)"
GEORGE SAYS NICE
"Good in some cases, I want to give it 5 but due to the summoning system of this game I kinda had to only give it a 4 I've played the game for years and stopped for a year or so and when I returned it nostalgic to say the least"
"Weird thing, game always thinks I need an update if not on wifi, jp version doesn't tho, love the game tho"
"I've been playing this game since launch, for good or bad this was the reason I got into gacha games. The story is iconic (Nasu after all), the characters are charming and loveable. The gameplay and graphics are starting to show their age but enjoyable nevertheless. Still a great time to start this game, there's a tonne of story content and events for another couple years."
"Love the actual game, but the data transfer.....? Yeeeesh. Knocked off a star just for that, I refuse to ever get too deep into another game that goes that route."
"game bagus, gacha nya baik banget, developer nggak pelit, aku FGO, gameplay gak ngantuk, apalagi story nya, cocok buat begadang, aku FGO ÔøΩ, aku cinta fgo ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ‚ù§‚ù§"
"I lost my account and I couldn't use the previous transfer code because I have used it already. I hope through this app review it would help me to get in contact with the devs and help me get back my acc which I spent money on, which ranges to 1k php to get 2 guaranteed 5 star character. (Update) I was able to reach out to them and I will be waiting for them to process my email."
fun game üóøüòé
"The game's good..but recently I cannot even play, says that there's no internet connection when I am connected.. it keeps crashing.."
"I'm a returning player myself & it just happened to be the 20 Million downloads campaign which I heard will give both SR & 4 star craft essence ticket. I saw the tickets & pressed claim all then when I went to Da Vinci's shop for exchange I couldn't find the ticket, The ticket counter just says zero. Is this a glitch? Please fix this & I'll give a 5 star."
I really like this game it have a good story but it has some Bugs and the data transfer is horrible I have to start all over again I wish it has a different types to save your data or transfer it üòï
Other than the gacha rate game is top notch
I like it so far but Im for some reason unable to exchange the 20 mil download servant ticket. The exchange shop for it doesnt even show up. All that shows up is the 20 mil download essense exchange shop. Please fix this.
Most predatory and greedy gacha without a competition.
The game feels like it is straight out of 2005
Transfer code is the only reason why I don't give this 5 stars
"Great gacha game with lots of events and welcoming gifts to attract new players. If you're a history/mythology nerd who likes anime and strategy-based games on a visual novel format, this is likely tailor made for you. Not giving it 5 stars though, because this game relies very heavily on grinding and doesn't have an autobattle feature. Bummer, but I'm not wasting my free time away on a neverending chore just to see the damage numbers on my characters go up. Cheers."
"Its not about the fun , its about being cultured , and by cultured , i meant hentai ."
"Honestly too much of a grind compared to new gachas, too little options too late."
It's a fun game a little grindy but its to be expected
"Having played for more than 3 years,I can say that the story so far, the characters, and the quality of the illustrations is good. Only complaint is farming for ascension materials in this game is still tedious and lack of any QOL updates. And please add a username/email and password login system, its kind of absurd how its already 2024 and theres still no option to do this/ despite almost every single gacha game in existence already having it."
"game keeps crashing if I try to buy Saint Quartz, and changing app tabs. I like the game but the crashing needs to be fixed."
syarat bermain FGO !. JANGAN 2. jangan 3. Unistall its joke you know
Good game had loads of fun the only thing I wish the banners at least guarantee a gold servant. I spent 300 sant quartz all I got to show for it was 3 max ranked craft essance other than that and the fact some times when I play and do a mission it would crash it and I would have to restart and the fact there's no auto battle it is a good game

"I've been playing for a year and half now, far longer than any other game on my phone. I played off and on at first in small sessions of 15min to an hour at a time with longer sessions every couple weeks. Now I play with same pattern of mini sessions, but now I login every day if possible. It is my method to decompress after work. The characters are great and the events are fun and very amusing. The main story is extremely involved and requires a lot more time and attention."
Wish the sevents spoke English can't understand them
"A good rpg that got even better with age, as older characters are constantly strengthened to keep up with newer characters. The story is arguably one of the best stories told in a videogame, and the soundtrack is amazing, too. Rewards have been adjusted over the years and it is now easier to get higher rarity characters as a result. Overall a very good game!"
best gacha game
"Definitely not newbie friendly without access to events but it's still enjoyable so far UPDATE: Over full year of playing! I've enjoyed most of the characters, art, animation, and story F/GO has to offer! I know there's animes/mangas/movies out as well? Either way there's allot of options for entertainment with this game/franchise despise a few nitpicks with the handling of certain characters."
"After playing the game for over 5 years I can tell you the game play has changed very minimally over that time frame. The only changes happened in the case of a new unit coming out that let's you farm better, these units are so good in fact it feels like a p2w when you have them and it's miserable not having them. Your game play only changes slightly based on class advantage and in the current set up you can ignore it completely. There's also a huge lack of end game content and goals worth grind"
"The lack of modern gatcha QOL features such as auto battles, but the game still requiring quite a large amount of grinding could be improved. Some of the older units are in need of buffs and animation updates to keep up with the newer ones however. The rates of the gatcha could be MUCH better. The meta of the game somewhat takes the fun out of it, with powecreep being in full swing, just so that the grind is as short as possible. All of those complaints, the Characters and stories are the GOAT!"
I had to wait
Game is great (:
Everything is fine now üíñ
Very entertaining
V√¨ roll ra 2 b√† tr∆∞ng
An enjoyable storyline and fun roster of characters. The gacha system is unforgiving though.
lost all my money on jpegs but loved it (and a great story that makes you cry a lot if your sensitive to crying like me)
"I'll never give them a cent of my money, but thank Quob for the whales that bankroll this operation. If you want to understand the hellhole that is the Fate universe then come on in the water's fine"
Great game.
"I've been playing this game for years. Honestly, with the exception of the Rigged and broken Bazet banner which they owe us an apology for, its a pretty good gatcha game. Solid free to play options, but the paid banners that guarantee a 5 star ssr are pretty worth it. Great storyline, but its hard to balance reading the story or playing the game as a full grown adult. I usually have to rush through the storyline because the repetitive grinding to get items could be toned down a bit. Fun game"
I love gambling in this game
absolute banger i loved the femboy when can we smash him
FATE FATE FATE FATE FATE OMG FATEEEEEEEEEEEE
Great gameplay
COOL GAME
"I inspired by the movie fate , so give 5star"
It's very fun BUT I can't play it anymore because it takes me to this screen with NO update button üò•edit:it's been 2 years and I finally have the update buttonüòÑ
"The game itself was awesome, and I enjoyed the gameplay. But when I switched my phones and provided information to recover it, they were unable to find my account. Even after providing the information they requested. I had my account for two years and invested time and money to build my servants. And now it's gone. I was highly disappointed üòû"
"So I played FGO on and off since 2018. On the last account I had 1.1k login days. I regularly spun gssr gachas. But past year the game has been so bad. They stoped reruning events (will start again in 2 years). Feels so outdated due to lack of QoL updates. And they started balancing the content around Oberon, and even tho I have him, runing same team all the time is very boring. JP devs are incompetent to do anything good, and NA can not even it they wanted. Idk Honkai Star Rail looks nice tho."
"Boring as hell, never played this before im used to other games this is by fat the worst game I've ever played. It's slow and mind draining. Everything about this game is terrible I don't know how or see why it has so many good reviews its absolutely dross."
"Absolutely love the game I've been in love with the fate franchise. So the fact that they have a game is great! the characters are all unique, the events are really cool, and for me the fact that almost every new event comes with a new gacha thing. and the drop rates are almost always up so I get the 4 and 5 stars a lot which I love. Why are so many people hating on the game just because they can't use the transfer code?? like it's about the game entirely not about one feature!"
EDIT: IM NOT EVEN MAD ABOUT THE LACK OF CLOTHES ANYMORE. IVE BEEN MORE PISSED OFF THAT THERE ISNT A FLIPPING SAVE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU HAVE YOU DOWNLOAD THE GOD FORSAKEN GAME ON ANOTHER AND DO THAT WHOLE LAME AS TRANSFER. GET IT TOGETHER FGO TECHS AND MAKE AN ACTUAL SAVE FILE. STOP LIVING IS THE LAST ERA!
Gacha system is a trash like getting a 4 star character is not possible even in 100th draws lmao.
It doesn't load in the game after you leave the gameüòïüòï
This game is so greedy.with abysmal rates and 330 pulls for pity and it doesn't carry over to other banners. Being a f2p player on fgo makes you feel like a begger on the streets beginning for the ssr you pull for only to be given nursery rhyme over and over again . I stopped playing because the gacha system is one of the greediest and the gameplay is trash and story wise it has has it's ups and downs
"Gacha spins, they troll way too much. Over 360 gems and I've got more useless 4/5 star essence than any useful chars. Pitty rate should be 1/3rd if that as takes forever to farm for gems if they programs to troll(they do)"
It looked good enough to download to me!
Cant skip summoning animations and takes way to long to get through
Worst gacha game to exist
"Really, I downloaded this game because ASTOLFO. Astolfo as a Rider class, and especially *Saber* class Astolfo... And I am not disappointed! However, it is unfortunate that Saber Astolfo is no longer obtainable- although it makes sense. Furthermore; Sieg being a caster? ...Yay, Sieg! An overall good plot, and if you both want and try hard enough, lots and lots of Astolfo!"
"Overall, the game is good, except for the gacha and the rewards when you win battles and farming in particular. The binding account still needs work tho and....what else can i say, im just gonna give it 2 stars, just my take on this game. That's all nothing serious. the game is üëç"
"Love fate sm honestly So although I would say this review can be considered Biased, the game is genuinely really good.But from my point of view, I've gotten pretty far in the game.I've took really long breaks from the game for no particular reason,But every time I come back, it's really fun And there is usually new Content. It's definitely not made for the weak hearted, because the gacha system,It's either you're really lucky or not.Either way it's an amazing game overall."
I hope there more saint quartz reward so I can get more character hehehehe
So slow
Goodüëç
"Fate grand order and its crew is awesome , I wanted to put this since every other time I put a problem here it was fixed, the material gathering quests on the current event are causeing the game to crash for me again and I have cleared the cache five times on the same quest in same area."
"Good game, but scam rates"
Nice game Good job üëè
"Great game, but i hope there will be improvements to the reward system for the harder game contents."
"amazing game, it inspires me and some artists ;-)"
The login method must be changed.
it's a really cool game and I like to see all the cool characters üòÅüôÇ

WELCOME TO FATE FRANCHISE GACHA HELL
"This game is the worst! I want to give it 1 star, but I did 2 bc the animation is good when the caricatures power move comes. But the overall game is trash!!"
"Love the artstyle of the game, and the combat can be fun as well. One of the main problems with this game is grinding for upgrade materials for skills and ascension. The grinding wouldn't be so bad if the number of drops were a little better. Also locking events behind progression is very unfair(i.e. having to complete Lostbelt.2 while im the way in Babylonia still, not fair). Please stop making events locked like that."
I really enjoy this game love the fate series and games.
Once you lose your account you cant get it back very not happy i dont like the way it works
I'm actually blessed by gacha ngl 10/10 I love my 2d gorlfriends (and boyfriends)
"Gacha system was terrible in the past. It's much worse now, to the point that there isn't much point in playing any longer. The rates for anything newer is lower than ever, including event ce, which is the only time you really -want- to collect some ce. Been playing for years now, and it's just so annoying."
This game made me realize how much I like inflicting pain to myself. Edit: still does till this day
While the gameplay is dated and tedious the story is fantastic and keeps expanding in a direction that makes you wanting more.
"Love the story and the lore is massive, the gameplay is also good but farming is kinda repetitive"
I loved the fate series and this game has great story and fights but the issue is I lost all my progression so that just ruined my fun
üëé
"Great game,with amazing music,voice acting,and lore,however I wish they would give us more saint Quartz and make it easier to farm,since farming is so time consuming it can get easy to get bored and decide to leave for a period of time."
The only issue I have with this game is how it's 2 years behind the jp server at least try to speed up the content and shorten its gap to like 1 year or 6 months.. Bruhh.
idk I just started playing cause I like fate. also for Karna and Gilgamesh too.

Great game. But beware the salt and grind
"Server issues, slow server"
Really good
GIVE US BETTER LUCK
Tunguska Raid was bugged and they never fixed it. Lost respect for the lack of effort.
Nice game
in gatcha hell but love it
This game kinda getting boring
Everything is fine but when I tried to draw Sigurd I couldn't get him I think it's hard to get him with that low of a chance for the draw and on top of that I feel like I'm getting teased by him so much that I stopped trying to get him
Fix the Eli quest man
The game is great but there's one problem the banner system there no guarantee 5 star
I love the game the visual effects/story/characters and cute waifus. But the thing is this game is too grindy for me and time consuming just to get materials and the rng is ridiculous and im just an f2p i really love the game but this is not for me. Maybe I'll return if there's an auto battle in this game that would be life saving.
It is the best Gatcha game I've ever plaid
"Great cast of characters, beautiful music, amazing combat and one of the best stories I've seen. Only complaint is that there isn't a feature to start the game completely over from the very beginning from the tutorial and enjoy the game from square 1"
"I don't know why, but this game changed my life. Such an entertaining game with PHENOMENAL GRAPHICS!!!! This game is one of my favorite games and always will be. üëç"
game barely loads ever lol its fun n cool n all but DAMN it just doesn't load and work properly half the time
Support sucks. Account binding system sucks. Gameplay is repetitive.
"Fgo stay away, not for the light of heart"
The app is fantastic but I have one think I hope this app can connect to the Facebook or Google
Want load and I believe that Google is out to scam as usual that is why this game want playl waistedeffort trying this game
Y 4adt5
i like good
"I'm going to be real. I only ever suffered this game because Tamamo No Mae is in it. This game thrives off of the fear of missing out and is extremely predatorial against players. To be precise, it has some of the worst bad roll rates for summoning new servants, exceptionally high-priced summon materials, and the least helpful pity system I've ever seen. At the very least, the story was engaging and really fun to read."
"Why is it that when I play the game normally and use the real-time translation software on my phone, fgo crashes?"
"It keeps crashing every time I exit the app and bring me back to loading it up again. Overall, everything is good."
Please rate up on 5 stars units please
Real. And heavy.
Rate up is a lie
I really like this game cuz it ages like fine wine
Es muy bueno
whats not to love about it? oh wait i guess the 5star pull chances are bad but i love fate so its whatever
I need to be able to link to Google for me to re fix score
Saber Alter. Nero. Yes.
Very good game.just wish the would.a(.a.sync account so.we.wont.lose.it.make.it.safer.for.a.back up
Could be better
"You know, from time to time this game can deliver some good content, but usually the game sucks, the only reason this game is kept alive is because all of us love the characthers, and most of the time those characters were born from other spin offs"
Dope
"Gacha game is simple, when your SQ number drops to 0, you lose. ;)"
"Immersive story when you are invested, worth the time in my experience-- likeable characters with deep backgrounds. Fate/Grand Order or the entire fate-series is really good in my personal experiences. Thanks for always working so hard. Happy 7th Anniversary üéâ"
‚ô°
"Story is great actually, I like the servant character you get at the beginning. Characters all seem interesting and engaging. There are so many servants to choose from so it has a great character selection. Things I wish it had was more character customization but you don't need to worry about seeing yourself allot I guess just would be cool. Some animations are great too but lags sometimes when wllot is going on. But still smooth of an app. Good mobile game to get your Fate fix."
Its not really fun. Quite boring.
"Edited. it was good 4 years ago but now it's outdated. not to mention the devs unable to improve their skills and add more QoL like idk, autos, skip and stuff. the grind is too tedious for ppl who are busy with their irl stuff (did i mentioned it doesn't have auto settings?) this is 2024. please do your job"
Abigail Williams is wife. That is all that matters. Gameplay - don't matter. Story (unless Abby) - don't matter. As such 10/10 game.
"This app has provided an amazing storyline, jaw dropping character designs, and amazing animation but this game has died out very fast because of the game not updating so I suggest finding a different game to play until this one decides to start updating again"
"This game is amazing! It may not have a marriage mechanic yet, but there's always hope for the future! I sometimes have to sacrifice basic hygiene in favor of grinding the events, but it all pays off in the end. I will have Gilgamesh and he will be well fed. If our fates fail to intertwine, I will grab them and tie them into a rope that I will use to lasso Gilgamesh down from the throne to my chaldea. The grind is nothing compared to my love for him."
"The game has been crashing non stop since the latest update. I can't even start quests anymore because it crashes the moment I try to load in, This is really annoying as I cannot finish the Christmas re-run."
It would be helpful if players had a way to reaqiure their game data from the last time they loged in to the sever vya entering a password on the title screen
They need to get rid of that useless transfer code and make it soo you can link it to w/e cuz ive had multiple great accs but everytime i wanna play again i gotta start all over and im not starting kver agaon so bah bye
"It became one of my main games lately. I will be looking forward to the next journey, too. Although if only the GACHA rates system are good, this game has the most worst gacha system ever, and their shop to buy gems are just too pricey and expensive, ya know. Not for dolphins to take much. You really need to whale over if you really want to get those juicy SQs. HOWEVER, the game does not require you to buy SQs when clearing content or grinding, okay? Don't get misunderstood on it. It's F2P OK?"
The story in this game is extremely good and even though the character summoning rates are kinda garbage the game is still enjoyable and can be played with any character.
straight up one of the worst gacha systems in any gacha game i've played. Expensive if you want to buy quartz and the rate ups are HORRID. Don't bother spending money. Maybe don't even touch this game all together. There are better gacha games out there if you must play one. RATE UPS IN THIS GAME ARE A LIE
Working
"This game was nice. however they need to set a system that can help with people who lost their accounts or forgot about them. Because I needed to remember my servant and other thing I couldn't remember. I wish they could make Google game accounts connected to the game a like AFK arena. That was only a thing I wanted to happen. But nope I had to started over again, again, and again. For game that need password to order change the device is really ridiculous. I do like the summon servant"
Fun gameplay and great characters overall. Although the lack of account creation and instead of relying on a code really sucks
Very good gacha game.
- . /
Very good game highly recommended
I like the game it's fun
I like this game but I have a problem one of my servants crash my game every time I use him three for now when fix this will go up
"I genuinely love this game, the Lore, the franchise. All of it. It has a lot of faults, and I've seen many of them since I've been playing it since 2017. I'm on my 3rd account and this one is my biggest and most heavily invested. But I feel like this game has a high for beginners and for veteran players like me. However, if you've only been playing for about 6 months to a year and haven't done much of the story then you can't do much on your own."
It has its quirks but it is a inescapable pull in all the good ways
Im done... what now?
"It is good game, but please... make it global because it's too bad that my friend who live in indonesia can't play this game. It has good one and also the linked save data make sure to add more"
The story and NP animation is cool but gameplay isnt the best
I love playing fgo but lately it keeps crashing. I even tried reinstalling and clearing game cache but nothing changes.. now I'm having a hard time doing quests due to this constant crashing. Please fix it üò•
At first i thought this game was boring 1 year later when i finished fuyuki singularity and when i pulled for a random character i got Altria caster the best support so i became amazed by her unique 3rd asension but someone deleted my account but i have multiple accounts now. This is the best game.
I really like it
Game is going downhill less and less consistent updates and disappointing servant releases. Not even updating old servant animations
"Love the game but it has a huge bug they've refused to fix for years now and in the current Bespactled Event it can actually screw you over. A lot of the time when you open the game for the first time it'll freeze while loading but still act as if you logged in, so it played the video for the rewards but I literally couldn't watch it so I didn't get it. And because this pathetic problem it pretends I just skipped it which I didn't, I literally did nothing wrong but the game punished me"
I used to have a high review but after the game has been crashing a bunch I can't even play it on my Motorola phone pls fix this
Best characters and plot of all gacha games
"I give three stars because i got back and missed a lot of events so far. The game is okay, but that drop rate on gacha can be annoying some times in each rate is not true for it."
"Great game. got the job where I met my wife all because I wanted to spend some money on the gacha. 10/10 sprites, story and gameplay."
"It's actually a good gacha game, though it might tire some players because of gacha rates, but gacha rate in this game is very reasonable if you think about it. Edit: Okay the pity roll is nice but it's ""kinda not that F2P"" atleast make it like until 10 multi's then only one guaranteed rate-up 5-star would show up and the rest is RNG. Not bad, but definitely not good, either. 4 stars until further updates"
This is fun plss add more event like multiplayer battle or boss battle and plss add an account to connect to this games like google acc or facebook account to save the game for the future.
Y'all need to make a new fate game lol its 2024
"My old phone broke, and I can't get my account back. Or at least I can't figure out how to."
"One of the best game ever! (But if acc lost just forgot about this game, pls make this game connect with other site)"
pretty good
"Overall, a pretty good experience. The over-acrhing story is definitely worth the time if you pace yourself (cause there is a lot). The combat card system is actually quite fun and I can't really think of a game that does it like this currently. The Gacha is probably the biggest fault. Too many characters, most of which are never brought up again, and it all leads just murky rates and horrible power creep. It has a good foundation but still needs some patchwork."
"Best mobile game, I have spent a fair bit of money. I have gotten threw lost belt 5. Honestly I never liked reading but I have slowly read more and more. I hope you find the same love I do for the game."
"It was good at first but playing with it for a while, it became stale and boring. The gameplay is simple and straightforward, story is okayish with the world building being 10/10, the gacha system is horrible, and overall really; the art of the servants and the animation trailers is what carries this game. The only thing I'd wish for it have, is a gameplay similar to what Punishing Gray Raven has; the fighting I mean. 1/5 stars because, as I'd mentioned, the art style is what carries this game."
"The game is fun, grindy and all salty as Gacha game should be. But the login way to so DUMB. PLEASE DEVELOP A GOOGLE GMAIL LOGIN OR SOMETHING. IM A PART TIME APP DEV FOR SOMETIMES EVEN I CAN DO THAT."
Stop with the stupid YouTube ads
Just gonna say this and the Developers might get mad but has anyone tried making a mod pack that turns the JP text into English? Would Love to play the JP version just don't understand or speak Japanese.
If only they fixed the lost connection thingy then I would put this on 5 stars
The Game is one of the best it doesn't matter if you want to pay 2 win because you can get the same units playing normally.
it was pretty bland at first but it gets more interesting as you delve more into it
now a new problem occured as my old phone was destroyed so i tried to transfer but says play on the old one now i can't access the created account on that phone but i have the ticket
It is amazing
Lost my account because the game cant connect to the server. I have a stable internet and it happened to me twice. 2 account lost. If only you do a google play connect account it wouldn't be an issue.
The game is good. The gameplay is fine. Gaint money hole to get good servants.
Considering how old this is amazing
"2024 still playing, gacha rate is abysmal but my luck cover it so its balance.. But for certain banner its over for me.. So far only doin my daily log in since this game have no daily quest, great for side game"
My account won't work I've try to email them but no reply so what do i do
"The character design and voice acting is pretty good! Gameplay is pretty nice too the only problem I have is the gacha rates, but what do you expect with games like this. Also, wish some events weren't lock because you didn't complete the whole story, which can be hard because story gets more difficult as you progress."
Absolute gacha hell
"Great gameplay, great story, great characters, the gacha is ehh but the welfares/low star servants are good (some being best in slots for certain uses) and jp being 2 years ahead makes it possible to save enough for np5 of a servant. One huge issue, there isnt an actual account system. Makes it really hard to manage 2 accounts on the same device, or getting back your old one (Ive lost 2 accounts, one actually had good progress)"
Really enjoying it but I do hope the old servants get a new animation update
This ganes just bad. Horrible animation. Art that is outdated. boring af story.
Sounds being a bit weird but it's fun
Been playing this game since the beta it could use better chances of getting gold summon characters other than that good game just need better chance for acquiring gold summon characters.
"The one time use code is a horrible way to save data. I've tried to use code multiple times and still have to restart because code is wrong or expired... I have had to reinstall this game a few times for various reasons not game related. Basically just got used to having to pour all my time into redoing everything, I can't really develope an attachment to any characters because they're different every time I've had to restart. Only issue."
The game has good Grafics and story lore! But you need to 30 to just do an 11 summon which makes this a very difficult game for people who can't pay but the summons are literally 50% five star! Hero
Loved the part 1 story so much that I'm going to download it on my tablet now. And well for re rolling let's not kid ourselves
Scam
Best gacha game ever. 10/10
"The story was enjoyable, and the characters are unique with their different art style."
"The 1% gacha is pretty gross, and it'd be nice to switch targets mid combo because combat feels very limited, but overall it's really not a bad game."
"Best game ever enjoyed the 9 years I played till we meet again ja,ne"
It is like pokemon game turn based so that is why i like it more
Please fix the game... I can't enter the game always saying can't connect to server
Crashes all the time. Hope you have a good phone to even remotely play this game. It has many other problems that I won't name. Won't fit the character limit and just talking about will be a drag.
"While I really like the games story and gameplay, it had to be said that it is a gacha game at its core so unless you are willing to pay lots of money you have very little chance of getting the high tier characters and in my experience you have almost 0 chance of getting the limited time characters, which has destroyed any motivation I have to play this game. So I suggest you avoid this game and find something else to play."
"The game itself is great. I wish we had more time for events though. Although, I have to point out that with my Pixel 7a, the game keeps on crashing. Sometimes the screen completely blacks out when I am playing FGO or try to slide back/swap apps with FGO forcing to restart my phone. Im"
"Cheap. Rates suck, start dash costs $17. You know it's usually completely free right?"

"The game is alright. I've been playing it for months, then stopped since it's quite boring and very grindy towards gacha currency, and when it comes to pity, it's 330. I wouldn't mind if it's 100+, but 330 is a bit too much. Overall, I rate it 3 stars for gameplay and story."
"Too much tutorial. Don't force me to follow ""friends"" and not let me opt out. This tutorial never ends."
Peak gameplay
"Addictive. The Gameplay is Fun, The devs are generous, You can clear the game f2p, good contents, generous events. Fun to play I'll give it a 5 star"
"I love this game, from the story to the fun RPG mechanics and the characters. I don't think this is a great gateway into the Fate Franchise, but I think it's up there. The biggest issues with this game that I hate are the awful rates on gacha pulls making you have to spend 450+ dollars worth of cash trying to get the character you want if you aren't lucky, and the many many events and character who are only available for a limited time, and characters who are gone when there isn't a banner."
MAOW
"Spend my 5 years on it and honestly rate pull is pretty mess up and just want you spend more but there no guarantee of it, I won't delent gane due to money I spend and stuff, but I just don't care about it or story I just try level up all my characters to max level and just quit this game for good, atleast star rail and nikkie and blue archives, are more fair and more better pull rate than this."
Waifu
"It's Fate, if you like the setting and characters you'll like this game. Also a must play for those whole like a good story. It has hands down the best story of any gacha game I've played out of the dozen+ I've tried."
Good old gatch turn baced gameplay love the lack of an auto butten cause it makes it feel like a game not a idoling movie stat sim like many other gatch also better aniversery rewards then genshin impact.
its fine now
"Horrible gacha rates inflated by CE trash, outdated & boring turn based system, events aren't enjoyable anymore because they're 40 chapters long of just sweeping trash."
Great story and characters. Events are very fun too. Don't expect anything from gacha. It has the worst rate in any mobile game. Better go by a lottery.
"Best game, best story, best characters"
"- Great character designs, but I want more varients (especially on male characters). - The stories are getting better over time. - Gameplay is easy to understand, but it's getting boring without some significant updates. - I think pity for the gacha should be lowered, 300 roles for 1 character is too much. - Rarely have QoL updates. - They give less care for pre released characters, I hope they give more love someday."
Badass
"Peak gacha, peak characters, peak storytelling!"
10/10 would make my friends jealous of my luck again (I am the one who collects 5 stars)
Best story I've ever seen from a mobile game and love the characters.
"Fun game, interesting characters, just wish the gacha wasn't as bad as it is"
"4 out of 5 of my accounts where banned because i was using my phone to get all my accounts back, i asked to at least unban my main account but they wouldnt unban it cause i was using my phone too much to get my alt accounts back, the reason i was getting my accounts back because when i put it my transfer code and password, all of a sudden it says connection error then i put my transfer code and password again, then it says already used, this happened a lot of times."
Horrible rates. Pity is basically non-existent. Game is crime against humanity.
It would be better if it didn't crash and wasn't stuck.
A nice game bad rate and can't get high amount of saint quartzs pls more saint quartzs
"The way they save your account is very dumb. I lost my account a couple times and it requir d me to email them with a novels worth of information if you don't have enough bye bye account. Even if you have spend hundreds of dollars. That's not even mentioning how awful the game is. It's not fun to play, it's almost impossible to get a decent servant without spending real money. Even the 4 stars are difficult to get. I love fate but I hate how much this game has influenced it has a whole."
I love this game but I don't know how to get spirit origin
The game could not launch properly so it advices to clear data to redownload content. When I did it restarted me back from the beginning. I didn't even made a data transfer code to retrieve it. I need help
"Big fan of the anime series (and all it's spin-offs), which led me to this game. I'm a bit of a mythology nut, so collecting and playing as all these mythological, fictional, and historical figures really interests me. This game has actually introduced me and got me learning about figures I've never even heard of before! Game play is amazing! New events, characters, and features are added all the time. Would highly recommend! Keep up the great work!"
stayed for the story
Trash game
game hay
Gameplay wise and creativity wise this game is great each unit is made well and even lower rank units can be useful situationally the only complaint i have is the awful 5 star rates and how expensive gems are if they were just a little more generous id give it a perfect 5 star rating
Astolfo buldge
"Love the story and gameplay. I only gave a three because the game account save is using codes and your password when transfer it to my new device I can't phone I can't recover my account and it's a waste I have play for 2 years and collected a ton of characters as a f2p and now I can't recover it. Pls instead of codes let it be google, fb or any easy access to an account transfer."
"Game good. Frame drops often. Optimization issues. Occupies a lot of space. Probably just my phone though. Overall, game good, story cool, Astolfo carries."
Need more Golden Apples and SQ for new players... Start dash is not enough
You guys need to make an online account. Like my phone broke and now I have no way of getting back my old account I spent a year in
The game is wonderful but the energy system is terrible early on but its good enough when u level up alot. The major issue is the gatcha aspect. The drop rates for ssr servants are terrible like they will say drop rate up but in reality drop rate up is still 1 percent. Like really.. one percent. And they are so stingey with giving u quarts which are used to summon. Free to play players will get shafted. Other than that gameplay is fun and the story it tells are top notch
"I already loved FGO from Camelot onwards, but the overall storyline for Part 2 has been so excellent I can't recommend this game enough. It's a difficult journey through each Lostbelt, but the struggles have always been worth it. This game is truly special."
"De los gachas m√°s avaros y un ainterfaz bastante vieja, a su vez tardas a√±os en volver a ver a la unidad que quieres"
"Great game!. One of the best turned based game I played. Also, Great story!"
CAN YOU PLEASE TRY TO MAKE FATE GRAND ORDER BETTER
I dont like king the game to easy and forces you to use op characters of vetran players
yorokobe shounen
Game
Everything is good the game is addictive even tho every fight is almost the same my rate is supposed to be 5 star but because of server disconnections i rate it 4 the thing is sometimes you have to wait for few minutes so you can play again but sometimes you don't you have to uninstall the app and install it again its fine if you have reissued a new code but what if you forgot it? Then you just lost your progress which sux cuz even 1 singularity took me a whole day to grind
"The game progress crashes from time to time, the first time I played, crashed for like 5 or 7 minutes, now it's everytime when I enter the game, using noble phantasms and opponent's too, and battles"
"Love fate, hate the pity system, it is insane that you need to do 330 summons to guarantee a character and the pity doesn't even transfer to the next banner"
No Google Play Save! Have to transfer from each and every device manually with password and long generated code each time you want to play on any other device. So no phone & tablet. No Google Play game save. Any purchases disappear. Happened to me. You've been warned about this older game.
Keeps crashing when in battle.
"Won't change my review until Lasengle stops being lazy and does something for the game that will be loved by ALL THE PLAYERS of this GAME in all servers. You could've stop servicing this game and develop another game, but both of us know this one prints unlimited money for your wallets supplied by your whale slaves, that's why you won't make any massive effort which shows your absolute greed and incompetency as a game company....oh sorry an INDIE game company, my bad with my mistake."
"I love this game and highly recommend it, if you like the fate franchise and turn base battles with a gacha system then this game is for you"
"I played LB7. Good luck with your potato devices cause ORT and his second form will lag your game horribly. well, that's when the update comes out"
"the battles are only fun for the first few times, not when I'm doing it repeatedly throughout the whole story. I wish they could add some cgs too other than a slapped on sprite. overall i think it's good good 8/10 since i can have blackbeard in my room"
Fun game I have a problem
SEIBBAAAAAA
Bad gacha
Keep losing connection from the game server don't know if it's just me and can we adjust the transitions? My eyes can't handle the transition of turning the whole screen off into instant white screen.
I really like this game because it gives me some knowledge about history and this is enjoyable game
Love the game
It's amazing even thought it's my first time playing it
Genuinely fantastic. An immersive narrative that just gets better and better the deeper you go in.
Great....
"I love this game so much and I love the Fate series so much!! But after you progress so very far and get so invested in the game and the progression you have made in it and something happens and you have to delete the app just temporarily in order to do something important only to find out that after you return to it and reinstall it, you are forced to start over from SCRATCH!!! It's so very frustrating!! I really love this game, but it is what it is. That is why I can't give it 5 stars!"
"can you fix Altria pendragon her damage is class B and Altria Pendragon (Alter) her damage are class A ,because they're damage are so much low than others heroe's, A im beginner I'm expecting Altria pendragon (Alter) 5 Star banner and A+ class but she's only 4 star and the most lowest rank as same Altria pendragon"
I WANT TO PLAY but my phone just can't run it so if you have something not that strong stray clear and please try and fix this aniplex please
Horrible summon rates
"Not sure if it's just an Android thing, but the game constantly crashes on lastest OS update when I decide to hop off a bit. Other than that, I'm a sucker for games with a card theme going for them and I love whaf FGO is providing so far."
Just another cheap gacha game with horrendous summoning rates
"As rumored, horrible and atrocious beyond logical comprehension."
Addictive and fun.
"Gameplat is visually impressive, if basic and somewhat dated. Gacha rates are terrible, and the game has a pretty bare pity system. Fun story, if somewhat convoluted due to all the series terms and setting quirks, and character designs, personalities and their stories are the main selling point. Starts bad but gets amazing once you hit the 6th"
I genuinely just want an auto quest function to make grinding easier
Game does not stay open in the background

"This is coming from a fan of JRPGs, MOBAGEs, and gacha games that make me wanna die: In the first couple years of FGO on both JP and NA, it was clear they were trying to find their footing. JP was getting favored real hard and NA felt like a consolation prize. That is 100% no longer the case. The writing is consistent, the mechanics are still evolving 5 years in, and the number of ways you can play the game and have fun continues to grow. Best for Fate fans and gacha hell survivors."
"Update: the lag is fixed but I'll never get my hopes up, cuz everytime an update appears it goes bonkers so only 4 star for now since it's not consistent"
"Been playing for a while, but being incentive for the long term, just isn't worth it anymore. The gacha is pure RNG with no fall back of reliably getting the 5* except pure luck, I guess I only enjoyed the game since I was a Fate fan back then, but the story itself isn't quite the best either."

Dead and with the worst gacha system you'll ever find.
Hell grind! Sure it's hell grind and if you want to get your fave/target servant you need to sell your soul to the devil to grind the amount you need for a guaranteed servant since the pity can't transfer to the upcoming banners. But nevertheless since it works that way and there's no auto so you need to farm manually I indeed made a contract with the devil and enjoyed myself playing this game AND YEAH YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT CONCERNING ABOUT META BUT INSTEAD WITH WAIFUS AND HUSBANDOS!
Nice waifus hehüòé
This game brings out the worst in me
Awesomeness
"10/10, no questions need to ask some improvement on some systems like showing the QP on the screen rather than just showing it on the gift box but it's just some minor nuances Still, the story is superb, especially since it's Nasu we're talking about, but still keep it up, wish you can got up to 10 years. will keep playing this game"

the game and graphics as well as the story line is good
Tunguska event is broken
"When are they going to put it in Spanish so appreciate the reading. You have to set a different speed for the fights, you have slow and fast, you just have to set one in the middle that's not slow and not fast."
its a fanastic I love the story and events come around their brilliant
"game is unplayable. Everytime I open it, I get a black screen. forcing me to redownload it. and every time you uninstall you lose ALL your progress. absolutely terrible game design."

"Used to play this game a while back I had fun with it for a while. But After a couple weeks I lost original account, and made another. Years after that my transfer code messed up and lost that account too. Contacted support and they ask for impossible to remember information for account recovery rather than having it linked to Google Play for fast & easy recovery. Considering even if you spent money they aren't helpful at all and too many other fate games to keep pursuing account recovery here."
this game I recommend not to play this game play any other game than this one oh and what is this pity system 330 for one 5ster character as a newcomer I do not recommend this game but I do recommend greyhaven or honkai star or genshin impact Oh and before you start saying oh you just haven't played a game for a while or no I have I play this game for almost in your like 3 months saving didn't not get a 5star to get guaranteed too 5stars you need 990 just to get one of course you need 330
The game doesn't launch properly even though I have cleared cache multiple times.
Bad game
There's so many limited servants it's not even funny anymore. And honestly a lot of them should have been story locked only (here's looking at you First Hassan and Iskander). Honestly they need a rotating limited banner at this point.
I love Sei Shounagon
I'm a former FGO player and I gotta say that the game disappointed me overtime. The story and characters are great as ever but the gameplay is incredibly dull. I'm a person who loves turn based games but the way they execute this concept is very boring. It just revolves around looping your noble phantasm for the billionth time. It's not fun. The only fun you get from this game is the CQ or the boss fights to some extent. I just wished the gameplay system was different.
Love it!!!!!
"This game is the best game on mobile, I'm so sad I've cleared it very depressed now all I can do is wait for events, with all quests clear there's no real reason to play anymore, hopefully they add some new stuff for people who have cleared all missions but still want to play, I'm tempted to just start a new game but I also don't want to loose all the servants I worked so hard to level and max level especially considering I spent a lot of money on them."
Well it's good game for the story It's Historical with a little Deviation if they fix the pitty system It's will be good for the players
"After playing this for all most 6 year planning to quit, gacha rate are the most worst after getting Morgan I was not able to get another 5* character since then . Already spend more than 1k free quartz after mogan"
Very complex and interesting strategy game. One of the few gacha style games where you can get quite far without a single high rarity character if you are creative enough.
"As of late 2023, and early 2024. The N.A. team has shown how lazy they can truly be when it comes to fixing any glitches/bugs in the game. And how little they care about their playerbase."
"Editing my post and rating. I hate with a burning passion how bad the RNG is in this game and how easy it is too burn away money with no reward for it. I rolled on the recent banner dumping money into it to try and get the darkness fox with no luck. Honestly I am almost at my breaking point, if I don't get a decent pull on the banner with Ruler James Moriarty I likely quitting and selling my account off. Fix your stupid RNG."
I do wish there was something like skip tickets or √ó5 options since It's mostly grinding in this game but it's still a pretty good if you love type moon
"Been playing since year one. Hate this game, hate that I've wasted thousands of dollars on it, hate the ""rate up"" system, hate that it took me this long to uninstall it."
This is EXTREMELY INACCURATE!!!!! and ANNOYING!!!!!!! I Hope This Game Will Be SHUTDOWN!!!!!!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
This is the greatest RPG/strategy game I've played
"the game is so clunky. reaction is slow, you can't skip any animation and for being called Fate/Grand Order (English) is sure lacking that in the voice acting department. oh and the reward system is so comboluted you barely know what you are supposed to do to get those rewards. I don't even know how this game is in the top grossing app store list."
"Very cool game, smooth game play, but the problem that I was experiencing with game was when I left the game. The game would not load. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game and had to start the game from the beginning since no previous gaming or account was saved. Please fix....."
Meh
Deadass bro this is straight robbery
"This gatcha is straightforward in spending and thankfully doesn't have packs that cost a fortune. You can only spend real money on Saint Quartz, which is easily farmable and saveable. Art and Story are very good. You can play at your own pace when you have time. There's regular events that give tons of free items. THERE IS NO PVP. It's a PVE game with quite it's fair share of challenges. One of a kind and I can actually relax while playing instead of having RTA anxiety."
"Overall the game is good but please update the account binding system, like we can bind our accounts to our gmail account."
I love the characters and story
"People really love this game for only story but aside story QoL for the game is one of the worst (non existence) I've seen in game. No auto, no skip ticket, no guide to get material, worst item drops, player skipping alot of banner, no proper Events, worst exchange shop. Only best thing is to have this game as anime only."
"2024 review (view edit history for previous ones). Gameplay is the same as it always was, have to grind and invest time (money if you're a spender). I'm only giving this a 3 star instead of a 4-5 star because... it's hard to play some (not all) of the boss/high difficulty battles because it keeps crashing on my device. So instead of having fun, it became more of a chore to try to finish a turn hoping it doesn't crash and have to restart again. Investing even more time. I still love FGO but..."
This game is cool
"yep fate franchise carried this game, worst rate up, worst pity system"
"I love the game but the problem is I can't link my acc so I use data transfer I broke my phone and got a new one this was like days ago now I have grinded a lot of Saint quartz I have reached out to fate in Gmail bit they haven't responded I hope I can get my account back, thank you overall my favorite game in mobile."
"Pretty good game, low success rates on 4 stars and up."
"For a gacha game, they are generous but like any gacha, it can become frustrating but once you learn to save your pull currency (known as quartz) for the banners you truly want, it becomes more enjoyable and the mechanics set it apart from most similar games. Plus the waifus and husbandos will get your gears turning xD"
This game is fun and I like how the battle goes the story is also good it's just that while playing it gives me crashes after crashes and it keeps saying re-download it or reconnect I already try everything and it's still not working can you please fix it
How do i make an ingame purchase if im outside US ?
No auto battle skip function. Toxic rateups.
Astolfo bussy go plap plap plap plap.
"The game is unstable, the gacha is still horribly predatory and lostbelt 6 fight designs are abysmal. This game is now third string material at best."
"Story locked event unless you play through entire the story. Have to go through lostbelt and singularity, I feel bad for newcomers who want to enjoy the game, they want to play event but have to skip the story to be able to play the event."
I can't get past the white screen
I couldn't Save my Progress on This Game and I couldn't link a account to Sync Across each Device so it doesn't make Sense because Sound Boring but Fun Games it not Recommended.
"The devs created a meta for the game that was unintended and have been attempting to course correct ever since. What results is a game that's become a chore to play with enemy gimmicks that aren't fun. For a game so story heavy, gate keeping said story behind enemy skills that are inconsistent and unfair to the player makes for a frustrating experience. The devs pursued the whales for meta and the game has suffered as a result."
"There's nothing worth playing here in this game, just go watch the story on YouTube. That's it. Boss fights are often terrible, I highly doubt the developers even actually playtest them to see if they ARE playable, such as the Lostbelt 5.2 fight with that Alter Ego, you won't even have a class advantage against him unless you have a Pretender, which there's only ONE of. Unbalanced, terrible gacha rates, crashes a lot. I repeat my first comment on this game."
I still enjoy the game but whatever is happening when I have my headphones on or switch to another application my game keeps crashing this has been happening since October please FGO team or Google fix this bug for all Android users.
summon rates are trash. you can really see how money hungry they are.
"The game consumes a lot of memory and stored caches can slow down the game graphics, so need to remember to clean the caches very often. Farming drop and gacha rates can be very low, but the developer is very generous with their apology and anniversaries gifts."
Its a good game but just keep crashing to much for me every time i use a support person's move the game just freeze or just straight up crashes friday may 20th 2022 it has now gotten worse and crashes every 2 minutes and it has now gotten worse i cant roll a 5 star or a enhance a 5 star with out it crash 2023 dec 26 ever since i got a phone that was made for playing games i can say the crashing has stopped so its a good game but that fact you need a phone of high quality to play sucks
Pathetic compensation
"The game itself is okay, the story is great, the music also, but the gacha aspect... Pity is non-existent, and the devs are greedy that they can't even compensate players properly when they make a mistake."
Been playing this game on and off almost since release and the steady downgrade and power creep is gotten insane. The most recent update has really cemented how out of touch Lasagne has become. The first raid bugged and auto completed due to a bad interger settings. This means loss of resources for the current banner characters and bond levels due to doing the raids. And the apology we get is just sorry here's 10 sq. It takes 30 sq for one 10x summon. 1/3 a summon when the pity system is 330.
The company clearly does not care when it wrongs it's players. I highly suggest you never start playing this game. This is coming from someone who does love many of the characters. I just can't recommend playing it though.
Best game ever it gave me ssr on start
"Dev screws up planned raids, which should have been an easy port from the JP version. Clearly the NA version of this game is merely an afterthought to them."
"The downward spiral continues. After releasing a bugged and poorly translated event, we're given almost a full day of radio silence, no actual fix and then not even half of a 10 roll. Utterly pathetic. The worst part is it somehow only gets worse from here with a 2 year long content draught coming. If I could rate it 0/5 I would at this point, and it sucks cause this game used to be the best on the market, now it's barely even a shadow of its former self."
"Needs an account function, came back to the game and lost everything, probably for the best though since this stops me from playing again"
I love the characters and lore but the gameplay gets stale very quickly and the gacha is ridiculous
"The game is good and the characters and the arts is good gameplay is good but as you continue to play its tiring because you need to play manually, its fine when playing story mode because you can strategize your move every turn but if you play in daily quest its become boring to fight repeatedly manually i hope you guys add an auto battle feature for daily quest fgo devs to make it easy to acquire enhancement,ascencion,skill upgrade materials for the convenient of your players and community."
Would be five but they've yet to give me gilgamesh and not the castor...
Lost data. This is also one of those games that force you to register for transfer numbers and account linking isn't an option. What makes it fatal for this game is the fact that you actually spend money at one point and you lose that progress.
"This stupid game doesn't let you migrate your data to a new phone, so I lost all my progress and blorbos when my phone bricked."
"Raid timers and limited time content is tuned to North American timezones, leaving EU with nothing. In this instance, a stage limited in quantity was unlocked at 3am Central European Time, and finished in 4 hours. Not recommended for European players."
Please fix the connection and loading. Cant play on a wifi connection
The salt of the gacha is too much but I love it edit: the last event is broken and you get to do nothing in the game
so Far Soo Good
One week is not enough for tunguska.
I couldn't even find a way to keep my precious Servant as I kept advancing. I'm done.
The latest Event( Tunguska) Made all event Craft essences behind a paywall however the only benefit that these provided was null and void as the Raids were programmed to end hours before they went live. Making them an entire waste of money. Shameful Display
I love fate
WHERE ARE THE RAIDS????
TUNGUUUUSSSSKAAAAAAAAA! Give me my raids
Awesome!!!
za goat
Gim jelek 6 bulan ga dapet SSR
"I love this game. Favorite anime series (all the Fate-verse) and this game brings the world I love to my fingertips. I wish there was a better way to get ascension materials than grinding nonstop, but other than that great game. Make sure you take an occassional screenshot of your Master's room and keep track of favorite Servants, in case you ever need account recovery."
"Please add auto mode it can be useful for players who want to afk farm, usually I used to have a 3 hour grind. But days go on it's starting to get 30 minute grind per day :/"
Keeps saying failed to connect to server
"With the latest Android update (newer phone), crashes when loading into battle. Literally unplayable until they upgrade/fix this. Which is a real bummer."
"Good game, just need to offer more rewards to its players, new free 5 Star characters and maybe return of 4 Star ticket."
"Fgo is very good game with amazing character designs, with an interesting story(Especially better if your already interested in fate lore),a lovable cast of characters, and a brutal Gacha! In my honest opinion the best part about the game is the Characters and story. And my only issue on this game is that we can't communicate with friends in game."
Game became super laggy after the recent updates
I enjoyed the game story a lot
Awesome
The gacha is terrible. If you don't want to suffer don't download this game as we have
"Had my account stolen from me, and the support team REFUSED to recover my account for me despite having name, birthday, names and classes of tons of servants and most importantly SAINT QUARTZ PURCHAES THAT DATE BACK TO 2018 but noooooooo the garbage shady degenerate support team refuses to help me recover my account. I'm absolutely sickened and disgusted by the lack of account binding and the lack of support for LONG TIME PLAYERS WHO HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS ON YOUR TRASHY GLITCHY PREDATORY GARBAGE"

Masterpiece!! It's a bit boring at the start of the story but later on the story became really good ‚ù§Ô∏è
I got Okita
Game crashes everytime i swap apps or close the phone since last update.
Good story line and animation but the the gacha drop rates are low
meow fgo peak tbh
No the one i was looking for
"I love this game and am a massive fan of the fate franchise. The only thing I have an issue with in this game is the way saving your game data works. The data is stored through a onetime transfer code to restore if you end up having to reinstall for any reason. I'd like to see this game adopt a more modern approach to game data saving if possible using Google play, or Facebook. Aside from that this is a ten out of ten experience that I would recommend wholeheartedly"
"Fun, addictive and got me into the franchise"
"i recently returned, i must say i will continue to spend money on this game, interesting story and the gancha and materials seems to be more friendly than before."
It's grindy but getting units u like is really gratifying
I've always loved this game!
Where my account.... ????? I had so much into thos account
Waste of time
It's not loading
How
Please add auto battle button
"I have started playing for like a year or so and till now i am still enjoying it. It has very good stories. Babylonia, Solomon, Anastasia, Olympus and Avalon le Fae are some of my favourite stories yet. And I'm also very fond of the gacha and the characters. Overall I love this game and have really enjoyed playing it."
"It's a fun game, but the pity system takes a few hundred dollars to achieve and the instructions on how to redeem codes is non existent."
"""In gacha we trust"""
I dig it. ü§ô
"This game didn't hook me. Other gacha games I have played (that I still play) have hooked me in with good writing, interesting characters, good rates, and/or an interesting premise. But from what I have seen this game has literally none of that. It's sad, I was expecting more from this praised titan of the gacha gaming sphere and I was disappointed. I would not recommend playing this game. Go find a higher quality gacha game."
I want the old one you literally destroy most of the good functions
Cute girls and pretty boys
The game is amazing. I just want to point out that my screen keeps freezing from time to time while playing
Feeding my addiction
great
"Haha astolfo is great, makes me feel a certain way ohhh my gawd."
This is Gacha
IOLOVE FATE -GRAND ORDERED SAMUNDERTAKER
Ever since I found out of this game I love it because I remember watch the series of the anime and it made my heart filled with joy to see a created with this type of anime
Love this game play it all.ost every chance I get.
The game crashed before it even started. It's saying check your connection. please fixes it.
Truly a great game and does the franchise well
"Gacha rates are horrible beyond compare but manages to keep people coming back. Here I am, installing once again."
I have Astolfo saber
"Great game, the lore is amazing, the only issues is that there's a crashing issue when ever you have wireless headphones on and the moment you leave the app and reopen it the game crashes"
"This game is the equivalent of going to a casino with 10k dollars and getting kicked out with no clothes, no money and a purple eye, but the story is great so a 10/10"
WHY IS THE CHRISTMAS EVENT TOO SHORT!
"These is a nice game with top notch graphic but there's a slight problem you see, theres lag spikes, some materials are impossible to even get,some times the screen freezes but overall these game is a nice game to destroy time if board"
I really love this game but I just wish it was a more reliable way to transfer your data I lost all my five star characters and story progress
If your a fan of the fate series then you'll have a really enjoyable time with this game
6 years and still a solid game.
Have been playing this game for a few years now and recently it is definitely starting to show its age and lack of innovation. Whilst the character design and art style is still top notch the devs definitely need to come up with some updates for the gameplay and presentation to keep up with its contemporaries.
Lots of womens.
I enjoyed this amazing great game!
"Game ok but I hate it, simply because I csnt seem to get astolfo... I've made multiple re roll accounts, I even got the rate up character on the banner! ALL I want is astolfo- thats its then ill play the game... ;-;"
Been playing for 6 years. One of the only gacha games that doesn't require a lot of my time. A side game for sure like a true mobile game ought to be.
This is peak anime mobile game experience
"My account didn't delete. I reinstall to get fresh new account, then it is still the same deletion again in main screen!!! I did fourth time"
Only gave me np4 demon king nobunaga wanted np5
"Amazing game,10/10 recommended :)"
"Edit: there is now a gacha safety net. And a pity system. Improving score. We got a censored servant in the NA version. QoL Japan gets are slowly, but steadily doled out to us (an is two years behind), but God do I wish it was faster. And after finishing a chapter in the main campaign, there is no way to replay it, but they are attempting a ""fix"" to this with SE.RA.PH. I hope Grand Order continues to make improvements in the future. Story is still 100% awesome."
"Love the game ^‚Ä¢^ Although the drop rates are kinda low, still it's one of the aspects of the game that makes you want to play the game just to get that servant"
"Good game gatcha bad Serious update after almost 2 years of logins. I grew really attached to this game and it's characters so even if gatcha can be frustrating, it's still worth it ^-^"
"Can't really explain why, but Ive just always enjoyed this game. Occasionally, the game will freeze up or just crash during a battle. But other than that, pretty happy with the game."
heh
perfect 5/5 game for fate/series addicts like me
"I love this game. However, this latest update has caused my game to constantly crash and I can't play. I felt lucky that though the most recent reviews complained of this, it hadn't happened to me yet. Here we are, though. Pleaaaaseee fix it. I have put so many hours into this through the years and would like to continue playing. I can't summon, I can't battle, I can't do anything. :( edit: they fixed whatever the issue was at some point because I haven't had issues in some time! fav mobile game"
"Peak, Kino, The goat, never play it"
I hate this dot instlit!!!
"The Fate series has been a favorite of mine since the original Fate/Stay visual novel. I was not that much of an FGO fan. That being said, this game needs updates. It's overly grindy and repetitive with the worst gotcha rates of any game I have ever played. Account handling is horrible, and if you uninstall, don't expect your stuff back later. It took 2 years to get a full team of 5s and still dont have all classes. Crazy how many Fate fans will give this 4-5 stars because it's all they've got."
"Good game, looks good also, team builder game based off the anime fate"
The ultimate game to play on the toilet!
"I was first indifferent to this series due to my misunderstanding how the story and classes worked. Now I warmed up to it. It's a really engaging game! Good series too. Some top of the line waifus as a bonus! Still probably my favorite gacha. UPdate: Game crashes way too much, it's almost unplayable now."
Ok
"After all this time, you still can't create accounts to save or cross progress to a different device. Wanted to go back after all these years of not playing it, and since I can barely remember my account, it's gone forever."
Broooüî•üî•
I think this game is awesome i like the graphics and the storyline and not too much lag.
Its good try it now
I LOVE THIS GAME üòçAND IM GIT GILGAMESH AND ENKIDU THE BEST DUO IN MY OPION
"Fgo is very good for fate fans, non fate fans and gacha addicts WHEN THE GAME RELEASED few years ago. Now it's dog water. I do still play to keep up, but lately i feel like the system overall is pretty much outdated. The stories are good past Singularity 6 onwards to latest Lostbelt. Yet it becomes very boring fast as the gameplay is a turn based with 2D side scroller-ish graphics and slightly appealing visual. In regards to the story, it is very good. It just needs more visuals other than pngs."
Crashing fixed again yay. Love game.
Crashes a lot but other than that it's really fun
"Recommended, this game have a good animation."
"The game is beautiful and enjoyable, but the problem is you're unable to bind in, please make a update where we can bind it towards google account and social media account."
Great Game choose wisely on who you want and save for them. The game Keeps getting better and better with every update especially for those of us who don't understand Japanese the subtitles really help a lot especially with getting to know your characters. The only thing I would want for them to add is an area were we can fight the hardest bosses over and over again to see how much damage are characters are doing and to see that big damage number when we fight bosses.
Wish it was in English
Arcade game theory of everything that you do not have
This game deserves 0 stars. It's idea of a pity for its gacha is over $300. You get nothing for maxed 4 star characters and it takes 10 NP 5 characters to get one currency. I'm glad there are better gachas out there. This game sucks and Lasgengle can rot.
Daed gaem
"this game is wonderful, it really is, but theres this bug that is killing my motivation with this game. for some reason, the game will at times just load for WAY too long. i turn off my wifi and pray that resources will download properly (it doesnt most of the time and i have to do it multiple times), and this happens FREQUENTLY. PLEASE fix this issue"
WHERE IS ASTOLFO
Boring
Literally the best mobile game story ever and gameplay is good enough
After closing out of the once I can't get back to the title screen anymore
Laggy
"The writing starts off as a bid mid. Bit when you get to the Camelot singularity (which might take some time) the writing takes a full 180 and becomes godlike, and that good writing stays for the rest of the game. The game also becomes bastardly difficult if you do not prepare for what is coming. The gacha is harsh, with the 1% 5-star drop rate and almost non existing pitty system. But you got plenty of strong 3 stars and free 4 stars which can help you on your way. I'd say it's a good game!"
Nice Girl Arthur
This is dog water. That's why I'm giving it a 5 star. Love the game lol been playing sense day 1.
Customer service suck they fix no problems
Fun me like fate
The game is very good I've aged it for a long time but if I'm being honest the story is kinda bland imo beating the story isn't that worth it tbh I Mena you get a grail and 10 quarts which is nice don't get me wrong but I feel like events should pop up more often and should be more accessible for newer players and the rewards for doing se basic things early game is nice but I wish some servants could get reworks (mainly Giles de Rais saber) I would like there to be new features like a wish list
Fun and fast
Addicting
I loved this game it's awesome but the Halloween mission s are hard to follow like beating the metal pu.pkins what metal pumpkin? But it's pretty historically accurate it's a very interesting. Great thing very amazing time filler huge fan of the series as well as the franchise in general as game as a good add-on to wish they could turn it into a movie or a show but all my data was lost I worked for hours üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ and I have no way to recover üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
"i played this game for almost 2 years at 1st it's quite good but after of some updates the app and the game keep logging it's too annoying and the bug never stop until this month and this day i wanted to play it it's stock on black screen, and it doesn't work out, will fix this...."
"I like the game, but since the last update the game crashes when I leave the app to check another app. Once this issue is resolved I will raise my rating again."
"Incredibly repetitive and boring gameplay centered on grinding and RNG, caters to fans of the series to remain relevant in a world full of better gameplay design and storytelling."
Newest event's locked.
Game has a weird bug that just crashes the app each time I leave it
"FGO has been an amazing game and is great for people who are new to the fate franchise to learn more about other servant's. But recently I've been having a problem with trying to get into the games server, my connection is great but it still won't let me in. Idk what to do but aside from that it's a great game!"
very amazing
I didn't go any further than the practice.
"Pretty cool. If ur game lags, delete caches and u should be good. Also I'm here against my will /hj"
It's pretty fun.
Complete garbage that's the first time encountered any kind of app game where you can't participate in an event because you didn't participate in an event a year prior completely retarded
The game keep crashing for no reason.
"I like it, plz give me more ssr"
I love the game if would work yall sniffing gule or what
Neat game
"(Edit 11/13/23) Back up to 4 stars, it works on my new phone."
"Crashes: Sadly the crashing issues are back, never wants to run in the background half the time. It seems to be a gamble on if it remains stable. Gameplay: It is fun to make teams of different cultural and historical figures that have plot and personality twists. I wish the gacha pity system was not so bad-- 320+ summons is a lot to get your character and premium currency is expensive. Unpopular opinion, but if they did a battle pass for monthly SQ I'd get it. FGO is addictive and enjoyable."
"Even after many years the gameplay is amazing, voice acting phenomenal, visuals are beautiful and the story is a page turner! This game truly deserves the title of the Greatest Heroic tale of humanity"
"Interesting story, better than other prominent games in that regard. Forgiving gameplay, not for the gacha coomsoomer mindset tho. Art direction and music is sheer breathtaking despite the multitudes of artists involved. Play it."
"One of the best gacha games out there. Great storyline, building your team is good, there are different characters to choose from. Free to play friendly game, although the premium currency is kinda expensive. Wish they could lower the price so I can roll on the guaranteed banner next time. :)"
"Gimme SSR, than i gip u 1 starüò¨"
"I give story, gameplay and music ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The 1 boss that I am terrified of facing is the ORT and reason why is it's one of the powerful beings in the nasuverse and my advice to new players, be prepared for the king of all marathon bosses"
FGO lore is one of the best things you will ever experience. The game is f2p friendly you can literally solo the arc 1 final boss with a properly enhanced 1 star servant but if you really want those 5 stars then you better prepare your wallet or use all your saved up luck.
I love Fate ‚ù§Ô∏è
scamba
I LOVE IT!!! Finally it comes to the english server.. waiting for ages!!!
This is story about taking back our waifu
trash
I love this game and I'm having a good time with this app.^^
Drop rates annoying af I spent 300-ish saint quarts for a banner and got no 5 star
It's very cool game but unfortunately once you don't get a transfer code when you get a new phone you cam transfer your progress which sucks. I tried contacting support by email but I received no answer from them to solve the issue.
The banners always rotate out as soon as you got enough to summon on it. And you'll never get the things you want. Desire sensor is fully activated
Amazing story
"It's a real shame when you've played this game for years and because of the constant updates the game crashes more and more, and even if your a paying veteran player even with all the evidence you give on purchases who you are they will still not help you get even one of your servants back. I will always be a fan of the show but I am no longer a supporter or fan of FGO. Also to be safe I wouldn't fund this game anymore."
"It was my favorite game until recently. I needed to transfer my account when i was doing it, though it said transfer failed and when I tried to use my other phone to go back to my account it logged out of that phone and I couldn't go back because I didn't have the transfer code, went through customer service for 3 DAYS and in the end they didn't give me my account I stopped playing because I don't want to go through the same thing."
"Great game... However it doesn't open up after the 2nd time, but it was fun while it lasted"
I think you guys should lower the cost for a 10 pull bro it takes forever to get 30 saint quartz and can you increase the rate for a five star like it's so unfair for f2p players
"as someone dat only care about a good story, no other game can beat dis 1"
It's fun
This is a great game I already got addicted and I'm barely holding back from spending money.
this game is awesome but it would be even moe cooler if goetia from this serious was given out for specific summon
Just happy to play Enkidu and Gil
"Gacha is broken, i didn't get a single 5‚òÖ since july 2023. It doesn't matter how much i roll, u til pity"
Saving for Oberon
"I've been playing this game for around 4 years now, and I can safely say that it is a really good gatcha game. Its characters do a really good job of taking history and finding unique but historical ways of representing them. The gameplay is engaging for a turn-based RPG. The game does a good job of making the lower-rank characters still have legitimate usability, so the game isn't pay to win. The story is very engaging, albeit time-consuming. Good even for people who are new to the franchise."
It is a good game with good mechanics and good plot but the draw gacha is unfair and ridiculous 50draw i got 5star servant but after banner i used 70draw not a single 5star servant show up thats also reason this game is bit dissapointing yea the free 14days to get quartz is useless to get 5star if the chnaces are low also no pity of stacks. The other reason this game is bit not playable because the account cant save to other savable site like others games.
Bro better give me luck fr
Played since launch and have no idea how I feel when the game ended
Wasted my life on this game. 10/10
I love Mordred
Love it for the characters and story but the gacha is unforgiving
I have decided upon further consideration to give this game 5 stars but I will warn the Gatcha rates are horrible and stupid expensive but the story just keeps getting better
"Enjoyable turn based game, nice character designs and story. Play responsibly."
"Tbh the Gacha is pretty bad but there's a friend point Gacha system which is pretty good for F2P players. Story is very good. Gameplay is very solid. And Events are very well written and very memorable. Since I am playing for the story, I think 5 star rating is pretty much deserved. If you don't like grinding and not a reader, plz don't even think about playing this game."
"It's okay, the story is the only reason most play it. Other than that rewards are horrible, rate-ups are laughable, and the daily mission rewards are hardly something to be even thought about. I mean who thought of this? A monkey with a type writer? You should take notes from a game called Destiny Child, very good rewards, gameplay, and rate-ups. Not to mention buyable items that help you summon more characters. I can see why Fate can't do this, you have a laughable amount of characters."
Your average predatory Gacha with blatant p2w mechanics. Don't play unless you wanna waste months grinding for a character that's barely usable. Trash game.
"Fun game but newest update kicks me out of the game consistently. If I let my phone go off game for anything, the game crashes completely and I have to restart it all over again. Uninstalled the game and reinstalled and it worked shortly. Now the crashing is consistent again."
Best rpg turned base game. But the loading screen is to long.. 2mins before the battle starts please fix that
"Worst gacha I've played. Lowest rates I've ever seen. Way too many materials for very little stamina to even farm for them. Extremely unbalanced fighting system. Requires way too much farming for materials, exp, etc for very little returns. Almost forgot about the terrible optimization as well. With an S22+, the game on the lowest settings, and following multiple trouble shooting guides online, the game will constantly freeze up for 5-15 seconds."
You can only transfer your game one time. So if you need to transfer it past that one time you have to start over.
5 star game. would not recommend
Game has been crashing every single time I put my phone to sleep or open any other app
"It barely has any enjoyable gameplay, is just reading and farming, with the very occasional fun bossfight or challenge quest"
It's ok
"Wonderful game, however, I wish it had more language options. I'm Brazilian, I would like it to be translated into Portuguese, as a fan of the anime and game, it would be splendid."
Awesome writing and very fleshed out (and ridiculous) characters. Surprisingly intuitive gameplay
"So far, WOW, in a good way. My head is spinning..."
Good material to fa
Im addict
I LOVE ASTOLFO
"Really Fun on mobile, but refuses to load on my chromebook"
(If you don't have a gambling addiction: üëç) (If you do have a gambling addiction: üëé)
"The game has really good content, it is crazy not to play if you are a Fate series fan."
Frequent crashes make the game unplayable as of recently plz fix problem
Game r√°c
More visual novel then game but the story aspect is truly fabulous. Sadly its heavily marred by the gacha.
"I like the story. Not so much for all the gender bending of historical characters. The loading is slow and you can't skip animations for attacks or noble phantasms even if you have seen them 50 thousand times. A lot of these noble phantasm animations are very long and eat up time. It would be nice if this game had skip tickets to help with slow loading grinding nodes like Dragalia Lost has. The drop rates for upgrade nodes are terrible as well. Also, would it kill them localize the voices?"
Great story.
This game is trash
Still a great game and still has an amazing story. Still not recommended tho.
"If you are a fan of the Fate franchise, this is a must play. It's easy to play without spending a lot of money, though if you want a specific character, you will have to spend a pretty ridiculous amount. In particular, the event gachas can be pretty frustrating."
"Was a long time fan but has been a massive waste of money lately, multiple banners and not a single of the rate up servants. Avoid the game unless you can afford it ""How about raising your Rate Up from nothing to an actual number"""
"great game, love it but don't play it"
"Horrible for me, played for one year and spent over $60 only got 4 gold servants all SRs and one of them is the automatic one from the tutorial. The two stars are because of the story Edit : i got roma in one ticket so i added 1 * Edit 2 : on second thought the rates are actually fair if you consider what rare units mean"
Noice
"My parents are going through a rough moment, and I'm trying to 120 Medusa."
ngl I'm not reading the app I'm reading the show it's a 4 because season 4 was trash ngl :) sao is good tho
Anime
"I liked Fate ever since I was introduced to it through Melty Blood, and this game is no different. I did run into one problem with it, when you uninstall the game, unless you were able to make it transferable, you cannot get your data back. When I went back recently, I was shocked to find that out the hard way. I had the rarest unit in the game, and I lost it. I can't remember anything beyond my old username. If anyone or even the devs can help me, that would be great."
Can this game run a FULL 2 minutes without freezing pls
Love this game. Graphics are awesome and game play is great. Recommend to all gamers who love fighting games and fantasy.
"I want an explanation. Why is the game slow to open or not opening at all? i even have a decent wifi now, so what give it's started having problems in October before it's still working fine heck i even finished castle halloween trilogy, but after the new update it's started to not work properly If I use wifi it won't open it always tell me to download catch but still it won't open it only open after switching to mobile data it open but slow so slow it's take me a solid 10 mins to play FIX IT!!!"
"While the Gacha is not the most fair in terms of its rate up % for a certain servant, the story of part 2 aka the lost belts are a worth while experience for a Type Moon/Fate Fan. Part one and the singularitys before the lostbelts are a mixed bag but again, are worth while reading."
Fat burds
"Best mobile game ever made. I have been playing every day for past 4 years. The most fair gacha game system, with amazing characters and story. I've become so much invested I think I am the Master of chaldea at this point."
Its so good to make me fall asleep.
I can't run the app pls fix it. :)
Fun game lots of good character good story and fun gameplay my only complaint is that its a slow burn at the start
"This game is the ultimate gimmicky scam. Every single aspect about this game is designed to milk as much time and money out of you for nothing in return. The drop rates are woeful and it's not like the cards have any tangible value anyways. So you are shelling out an arm and a leg for what is ultimately pixels on your screen. Everything else from the QP, AP, EXP, and everything in between is designed to be as time consuming and grind-y as possible. Cool artwork but this game is pure trash."
"Have been playing the game for 5 yrs, and while it's a harder game for newer players ,based on the current story, it becomes more fun the longer you play. Challenge quest are down right impossible for newer players so if you are reading this and are new don't get frustrated if you can't tackle challenge quest. The story is fun, but the gotcha can make or break a team. Fortunately even lower servants are useful to playing the game. It's 4 stars because...Gatcha, but its not as bad as others"
If 5 stars pls give me more wishes
This game sucks you have to pay to get any good characters do you have to grind non-stop to earn enough to get a good characters
Worth going homeless for my baby girl barghest
Probably my favorite game app. Would be great if we could pick any 1-3 5* characters as a thank you too.
"Accidentally uninstalled, didn't know it deletes everything so now i have nothing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Odorokubakari awesome
Great game too much faservice but I ignore it
"Just updating the game, don't mind me"
So cool üòé
"It's impossible to pay this game on Android, it freezes too much and crashes even more. Every event the game gets worse or unplayable, it's impossible to get past mission two part two for the Elizabeth Cinderella Halloween event because of the THIRTY DAMN ENEMY ANIMATION TRANSITIONS, yeah thanks for that. Fix your game already, if you can make these events? You can get off your lazy bums and fix it to make them playable damnit."
The best game for me!
The gache system SUCKS!!!! TOO MANY CARDS!!!!
"Game keeps crashing regardless of what I do, the only thing I find enjoyable about it now is that it's Fate. I would've given it 1 star otherwise"
Fgo my beloved
Its so laggy and really dissapointed to play this game. I love this game but there is something wrong about that
"While I really enjoy this game, it is getting to the point where I don't want to even look at the summon banners. This game has gotten totally out of control with the lack of of clothing on the perverted looking servants. It is just no class and very poor taste. I didn't mind most of the older servants, but now, it's just gross. As a female trying to play and enjoy this game, would now not recommend this game. So sad, some dev pervs had to ruin it."
The crashes have gotten much worse with them happening every couple minutes.
Freeze up and get kicked out
Its a very fun game but alot of grinding
"Awesome game and would tell any Fate fan to at least try it out you won't regret it, the only down side i can think of is the rates in the game(kind of bad) but as a counter you can use ANY unite to beat the game(yes even low stars)"
I need help to recover my account but I didn't make a transfer code since my old phone is permanently frozen and I don't want to have a new account since I wasted a long of money on it so ü•∫ help
The game is fun.
"Great 2D turn-based game. Music is amazing. Main story is beautiful, side stories are both wacky and tear-jerkers. Except the writing in the first 2 Singularities, which felt weird. Gacha is unforgiving, but not impossible (go 990 club or go home). Game can be cleared with 4* and 3* characters. Waifus are top-tier, Husbandos too. Materials can be a pain, but events make up for it. Save accordingly, spend wisely. And give it your 100% Maximum no chill."
"Overall it's a nice experience, I love the story and characters but the pull rates are pretty abysmal however it's not impossible to get the servant you want."
"IMPROVE GACHA RATES & FARMING.. IT ALSO HAS GACHA.. AND PLEASE GIVE MORE SQ AND STORY EVENTS, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO AFTER COMPLETING LB5"
Very bad gacha rates. Probably one of if not the best lore among all gacha games. I can't give it 5*s due to the lottery rates. Story is great but purchase options are horribly outdated
Gacha GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA!!!!
Gotcha dispair
"Gacha may be garbage, but I enjoy it. Great events to grind, and story is a grabber."
Love the amount of characters and story. Gameplay is meh and gatcha is hell. This game is in serious need of a overhaul
Can buy quartz
game fun
"Been playing for 5 years already, and I still love it as much as the day I first played it in 2018. It's one of the oldest gachas that's still ongoing, so it really impresses me it still has so much content, and a story now that puts any of its competitors to shame. The gameplay is outdated for sure being as old as it is, but the characters, story, and charming events will always set FGO apart as a cream of the crop. Bruh, I read Lostbelt 6 for 8 hours at one point, and I didn't want to stop."
Its ok
Nice waifu collection game and easy to understand gameplay. Love it.
"Game works again... after getting an entirely new phone. If your engine updates are going to keep people from playing on older phones, a little warning would be nice."
"As someone who normally doesn't like mobile games I was hesitant to give this game a chance but because I really love the Fate Franchise I decided to try it and I'm honestly surprised at how fun it is. even the gacha stuff is not as obnoxious and pay-to-win as other games. Game is not without flaws, the grinding can get repetitive, the story is slow and boring in the beginning but it gets definitely better later on. If you like Fate media you gonna have a good time"
"Great and agonising! Very fun, Highly recommend!"
"I've been playing for nearly 3 years now and never regret spending time for it. Although sometimes gacha sucks and dead weeks pretty often, the main story is worth to read and very impressive, especially LB6 story. Character designs are good and unique. Many ways to earn sq. Even 1-3 star servants can do high difficult quests. Now I'm even more grateful that the game doesn't have 50-50 pity and insane gear stat farming. Thanks LSG !"
"Bad gacha chances, bad gameplay, chars is ok. Only idea is good, barely."
Very good
I'm only playing because of the characters and the story and not so much for the gameplay. Many ppl will tell you that the pull rate for this game is the worst out of all the gacha games. And it is true. Farming mats is also hell. Stay away from this game if ur not a lore/story guy. Stay away from this game of ur not a fate fan.
"Good game, horrible gacha"
great game i really enjoy playing but since the last maintenance update the game keeps crashing since i got on the Camelot stage. my phone is 5g and very fast so please how can i fix it because i haven't been able to play since last night
Very nice game.
"Can't even play it, it just stays on the loading screen after ""click to start"" is shown it just loads and loads and nothing happens it's disappointing because I'm a massive fate fan and really want to try this game out. :("
"I love playing this game but every time I try to log in, I have to clear the cache multiple times and just hope it works. It's been happening for months now and all I want is to have fun again. I would have un-installed and reinstalled, but I don't want to lose my champions again"
I lost my ID forever
Tried installing it on my android 11 but it doesn't run...
The adventure is endless and the females are heart throbbing.
It's one of the most games I would play for long till I die.
The game is great! But the summon rate for a Servant SSR is way too low. Ive done 6 √ó10 pulls and i havent gotten a si gle SSR Servant.
I like the game it's just like the anime
Minus 1 star ‚≠ê for gacha....
Amazing game been playing for a long while across different phones and chasing Musashi in the gacha but the game has been crashing a bit and I'm not sure if it's my old phone or the game so yeah but a great game overall
It's good but rates are awful
"You no give okita alter saber yet, you get 5 stars whem i get her"
"FGO has been by far one of the worst gachas ever. Gameplay that is repetitive as hell. No autoplay, meaning you're spending hours playing the same quests you've done hundreds of times. And almost no ability to easily upgrade characters since Item drop rates are abysmal. The horrid pity system (good luck getting 990 SQ) Oh and when I messaged them on them fixing the game since it kept crashing on my phone,they promised a fix in August and it still kept crashing. Thanks devs."
"My absolute favorite mobile game. Fight with constructs modeled after historical figures, enjoy some of the finest Visual Novel writing, play some really well-made and frequent events! The improvements just keep pouring in and it has never been easier to save the world from multiple threats! Sometimes from your own people! Ah well, it can't be helped!"
"For the love of whatever god you believe in, please revamp the Pure Prism shop so it can reset weekly or monthly, farming is hell for new players and you can't get some ascension materials until very late story stages."
"Hands down one of, if not the best gacha game I've played in a long time. Interesting plot, simple game mechanics, amazing music and art and some memorable funny moments. Would definitely recommend picking it up.(Even if the summoning rates are ridiculous)"
Add more loli add more loli add more loli send me dic pic
"Great game, farming a bit boring but animations is top tier"
Great game. Only problem is the UI bugging especially during battles.
astolfo = 5 stars
"Great story after singularity 5, sometimes the gameplay is fun, sometimes is just boring farming, good visuals voice lines and music."
I'm addicted to gacha... I've spent over 1000 hours on this game and WELL OVER 1000 DOLLARS! I LOVE GACHA!
Lots of hot guys! Rasputin my husband
"gave me mental illness over female van gogh, overall a pretty good game 10/10 would go into debt again"
"This game has come a long way in its storied history. It'll never shake its tainted legacy of being the worst gacha in history but the devs have tirelessly to make all servants viable and have slowly but surely improved the game in many many aspects, except pull rates. The story and characters are easily some of the best and in my opinion it's saving grace. With the new studio I am cautiously optimistic that every aspect of this will keep improving. I wish the new devs all the best."
I have beaten lb6 PS. i hate you nasu
"I play on mobile, and every time I try to play ANY of the new Yamataikoku event, the game shuts down on me. I know it's an Android problem because the same happened with JP 2 years ago as well."
"I'm still on Solomon, but so far Camelot and Babylonia are very very good Nasu works üëΩüëç"
"Amazing fun game, would like an auto mode or even a times 3 speed up but other than that good game"
"Finally it doesn't feel like a ""wait for 2 years after JP"" server anymore. The English version is unique in its own right."
The rates for SSR are awful compared to other gachas and the pity takes far too long. 10/10 farming simulator with epic story
Downloaded it for astolfo
"This game does not have a self insert MC. If you start the game with that belief it will harm your enjoyment of the story. Rates are fine, even if low. It makes each 4/5 star feel special. The story is really long and is probably the best book series I've ever read. It's far better of a story than any other fate works. You're expected to reread story and theorize, but stay away from the online fandom because it's toxic as hell. Anyway it's an incredible game and I'd really recommend playing it."
It's freezes but its fun
Keep getting stuck in a loop of failing to connect to game server. Still getting stuck. Need to resort to using emulators. Still getting stuck. Still stuck.
Love it but I cant day more as I dont play it to often but when i do it's a amazing game
"Great mobile game. It has amazing stories as well as servants. There's a significant amount of lore available as well. You DO NOT have to have the best servants. You can get through everything with low rarity servants. So, if you don't want to spend money, you don't have to. Does it help to have high rarity servants? Of course, but it's not required. Just borrow other servants. This is a gacha game. Don't expect to get everything handed to you. It takes time and luck. Seriously."
"PLEASE give us option to not pick a companion, I don't like using other's characters."
Jimmygomez
A big fan of the fate series. I love anything fate related and this game helps me come back to it whenever I want to. I do wish they'd create another fate mobile game as this one's kind of old but I love it regardless.
"I don't know WHAT happened, but the game crashes so much that I can't even LOG INTO THE GAME, it took 5-6 crashes last time I logged in to get through it, and now, after at least double tge amount of attempts, I just straight up can't get it PERIOD. PLEASE FIX THIS"
I hate everything you stand for. (affectionate)
My favorite game to play. Great story and excellent story
"Everytime I spend money on this game I regret it -- pity is so high. Art, story, gameplay, all of it is so good. BUT, it is INCREDIBLY hard to get the SSR characters sadly. If you are generally unlucky...good luck! Wish there was more opportunity to get summons."
Ever since Lasengle took over from Delight Works my pull rates have been absolutely garbage! Scam company
This game. It's really phenomenal they love there playerbase. They want you to get the characters you like. But there are also some premium options but they aren't forced on you. And NO AUTO PLAY absolutely üëå
I did a 40 pull and did not grt a 4 star or 5star this game does not give you good reward you get to a 3 to 5 pull for doing one chapter which takes forever to do
Use to love the game. But since the update it will not even load. Hope it gets fixed with next update.
"Game is good. I watched the anime, and ended up playing this. For me the gacha rates are bad. No pity. And the transfer code is kind of annoying. Lost my account multiple times. Really wish they would let us bind our accounts in some other way."
"I loved this game before but ever since the last annniversary update, the rate of getting ssrs seems to have been f'ed. You can't even get at least 1 ssr in 300 sqs which, as a late gamer, can only be acquired by playing for months. I don't think this game is worth my time anymore"
it's gacha is extremely bad and predatory as well it's pity system is garbage it's impossible for a f2p player...you need 900 saint quartz just to get 1 guaranteed SSR servant and that is one of the issues. the pity system is bad. If the pity system was change that you get the SSR servant in 15 pulls you will get more people into buying saints quartz. It's better than what is being offer right now. Until something is change for better you get 5 stars for the story but 1 star for bad gacha rates.
I think I try fgo at least once every year and every time I remember why I never stick with it. the game itself is a very solid rpg and it can be rather fun. The lack of auto can be grating sometimes. It's just the gacha is terrible and 330 pity is equally bad. The fact it used to be worse doesn't help that I just feel repeated disappointment then leaving. If your a fate fan or don't mind just going with the flow it's a definite must try but if you are a impulse buyer it's best to stay away
Only one thing to say : Lostbelt 6
what have i done...
Hello I'm a fan of fate series so imma rate this 5 star
5 years and still no Jean Alter but still love the game (Come Home Jalter qmq)
"Goat game. I love fgo now and forever, the game has now a special place in my heart especially the waifus. Fgo is now part of my heart, mind, soul, and body. Without this game my life is meaningless and pathetic even though sometimes you hurt me when i'm pulling i still love the game. The lore is good and easy to play, fgo is sometimes generous(well except for luck jk xD). I, nico, shall dedicate my credit card, wallet, allowance. I pledged to you my liege that i won't play any game except fgo."
Game looks good but i cant play it on my older tablet
"Someone please help, my app was working and now it's not. Started today and spent the $12 to get a 5 Star but now every time i open the game it gets stuck on a black screen.. didn't link my account. Please help."
"Best gacha game. Sorry, I don't make the rules thats just how it is."
Thats hell you are walking into
Please give me my Summer Kama already. Thank you (or not) in advance.
Because I've been enjoying this series so far especially on the arcade one.
i cannot link to server after google update today; they broke the game
definitely one of the gacha games of all time
Great and engaging storyline. Edit: I'm adjusting the rating because the App keeps stuttering here and there with some freezes from time to time. It seems to be poorly optimized as I have a flagship device.
Needs auto or sweep stage.
"This game sucks, relays too much on luck even the gameplay. Also the gacha system sucks,too salty. Even the Dev are stingy 20k reaction for 6 Quartz (2 single rolls),but story is good."
MID
This is a great game!
Pense bem antes de entrar para esse mundo. √â um caminho sem volta - Palavras de um viciado
Better than the Chinese games that spam YouTube ads
"Nice fgo , best turn base and Anime gacha game . Although sometimes I'm disappointed because 1000 SQ only gets NP 2 SSR rate on. Sometimes 1 - 10 summon tickets even get 3 SSR rate off. And since the pity system came into existence, it has become difficult to get a guarantee servant SR"
The best mobile game ever. Truly a masterpiece of it's genre. Everything from the game to the character designs is a 10/10. The game is perfect.
"Gacha salt everyone, 300pity is real and 2 roll tix ssr is also real, game is weird asf. WE ALSO NEED A NEW ACCOUNT SYSTEM!"
Gacha is booty
üëå
Unskippable tutorials are horrendous. Made me want to throw my phone out the window.
"I'm blonde fetish and i love the servants especially Artoria, Mordred and Jeanne d'arc idk"
"Story is top notch. Character design are top notch. But everything else sucks. Boring gameplay. Unlimited Loading screen. Very low SSR rates. Quartz (in game currency) is very scarce. Play other games, unless you're a huge fate fansl."
"I've stopped playing this game for months at a time repeatedly, and keep coming back to it. The characters are just too charming, I can't abandon them."
I love everything about this game
"After several years, still didn't resolve poorly executed game mechanics from startup like NP strength down and star generation up. Also, very unwelcoming to new players. Some events literally lock out new players. At least give some event benefits for moving through main quest when you can't do the event. Main quest is too long when literally starting from Singularity F. Every time I see an event that I can't participate in, I drop the game and spend my money elsewhere."
Type Moon visual novels for android WHEN!?
I'm waifu simp so this game is wonderful ü•∞
This is the most addicting gotcha game I've ever played that doesn't take the gotcha part too seriously. I still have a lot of four star and five star servants in the game that are amazing.
Good overall
"I've played this game for now 4 months, and I love it! It's really fun. If you like action, offline games, and magic, then this game is for you! But I would love it if you developers could make a future update that you could have online battles and could battle real players. Also, I would like the percentage of getting a 5 star servant more likely. Maybe like 1.5%. But I did get some 5 star servants still. But it's a great game! I would rate 5+. But, I would recommend this for ages 7+."
"No battlepass and has top-tier waifus. Some of the story chapters are absolutely bangers. The game's combat can be really rough at times, but once you build your momentum, you are set."
This game is a wonderful experience. By far the best story of any mobile game I am aware of.
"I have played this game for a couple of years and I love it a lot. There is a lot of content on here and it keeps giving more. When I had an issue with my account not transferring correctly, they were able to help me no problem. They are good with communication and the game itself has so much you can play. Love it."
"I've played Fate for a few years now and I love it! It's addictive. They've got a lot of freebies so you really don't have to spend money on the game unless you want to. It crashes on my phone from time to time, but I chalk that up to having a sub-par phone üòÖ It's my favorite gacha game at the moment!"
best hell gacha game ever
App is crashing constantly
The game itself is quite nice. My main gripe is really just how long it takes for the game to load and do anything
Good game. Current problem for me is in the thanksgiving limited quests it says to complete nodes in main quest part 1 or 2 but i have already cleared lostbelt 5.5 so i ahve no main quest nodes to do. Should i miss out on quartz for being too far ahead??
It takes a lot of grinding to get enough currency to pull. And the pull rates aren't even good.
Great game. Only issue is the gacha is unkind most of the time and saint quartz for the summons are not given enough for top grossing.
"Outdated game, grinding is hell and it devalues the gameplay, game still has no auto / skip battle feature after 8 years of it's release, they stop releasing low rarity characters and updating their animation, UI is STILL trash, needs more QoL updates, THE GAME IS STILL 2 YEARS BEHIND FROM JP WHEN EVERY OTHER GACHA GAME IS 6 MONTHS. Only thing this game is good for is the story and characters, the release of which slows to a crawl every year. Latest anniversary made me is so disappointed I quit."
It is more desirable if this has a Facebook or Google save function since the player mostly are playing this for a certain amount of time then delete then gonna download and play again but sometimes the save function for this game didn't really save the game or being misinterpreted as it can be used endlessly but in reality the save function can only be used once and you need to re issue a new save code to use.
"For the past month or so, the daily log in rewards havnt been payin out the free summon ticket at end of each week. And I NO FOR FACT i logged on everyday for past 2weeks and ZERO TICKETS"
"Story rich, respect your time, addictive, all characters are well created from 1 star to 5 star, you can farm until you die, gacha is hell, this is Fate."
"F/GO is actually my first gacha game as a player in Gacha Verse, and I am quite glad that the game is doing great in terms of improving further, if there is something I would like to suggest, that would be implementation of some mechanics such as ""Skip Button"" for the nodes that you have already finished such as EXP nodes and so on, in that way, grinding would be more easy for those players who has almost no time to play the game itself."
FIGHTS ARE OK BUT CUTSCENES ARE TOO LONG ALSO WHY CAN'T I SKIP WHEN SUMMONING I JUST WANNA SEE WHAT I GOT ALTHOUGH THE SUMMONING ISN'T LONG WHY CANT I SKIP ALSO THE GAMES QUALITY MAKE ME FEEL LIKE ITS TEN YEARS OLD OTHER THAN THAT THIS GAME MAKES ME WANNA COMMIT GENOCIDE .
Superrrr good game
"I have started from last year November, and simply the game is beautiful."
very good
So i've had an account for about a year got so limited time servants and in general had a pretty big account. My data got corrupted when i was moving it over to my new phone. But instead of getting super mad I actually got excited at being able to experience the story again which is a testament to how fun this game is.
"Pity system makes fun of your time making you do 330 attempts JUST to get 1 SSR thay you can't choose whatsoever Don't waste your time with this one, I'm playing since 2019 and the game sucks! worst % chance ever seen on a gacha"
If your a fate fan play this game
I looked up genshin impact and this is what this is not genshin impact so I hate whoever designs PlayStore to do this to me üò°ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨>:(
This game is a nightmare I can't wake up from until it gets shutdown. 10/10 Prisma Illya characters are best girls
"It may be known as the hellscape of gatcha for a reason but it's unbelievably addictive, especially if you love the Fate franchise. I've invested more (time and money) than I'd care to admit. The story is fantastic, animation is nice and the character designs are beautiful and well thought out. Gameplay is simply turn-based but is somehow still engaging. I've been playing for years and have yet to experience any technical issues. Like everyone else, I do wish there was an email bind though."
I'm not downloading this game do not download SML play and now I can't download this this app is very horrible I'm going to like this game
Best
"Great game, gacha rates are as abysmal as it gets but sometimes it also gets a bit generous so I don't really have much of a complaint. If you're a fan of the fate franchise, there's a good chance you might also get into this game. The story, characters, art and music compositions are just one of the best that I've experienced from this media. Especially in the later contents, the quality of pretty much everything just gets greater and greater, overall its just good. Definitely worth a try."
How do you guys going to do clickbait like that
Fun and kino but sometimes cruel.
"UPDATE THE GAME!!, QOL features are needed such as account system instead of data transfer, a better pity system and some UI changes. Aside from that, pretty good game. Enjoyed the story and the gameplay a lot."
game is not super engaging or anything but i like it
"I got jalter so 5*, story and music good i guess"
Played this quite a while ago. Been trying to get back to it. A lot of older servants still desperately need animation updates. It's literally been years already.
It's so unbearably slow
Lots of content for the fate franchise! Just wish there was an optional autobattle feature because farming can be a bit tedious after awhile.
Very nice üëå
I can't play the game anymore. After the update the game won't load for me. Every other game I have works but not this one. It says to have a better connection. I've deleted and re-installed but it won't let me play. I don't have a problem with other games
Very fun but the gacha will kill you
The order is definitely grand.
Game always freezes randomly for about 3 - 5 minutes. It's really annoying.
"Great story, but game UI seriously needs to be updated. It was bad when it was released, and it is even worse now that their are other more recent gachas that have better systems. No real account binding system either, I mean *come on*! Actual gameplay is boring and repetitive, most of it is farming. That isade even worse due to the constant crashing. Unless you really care about Type-Moon, I really don't recommend playing F/ GO. Arknights is pretty fun if you want gacha and strategy."
Jack the ripper was here.
"I am honour bound to make this review. Due to life sucking I lost my account and info, I read recently that FGOSupport can recover lost accounts. Even though it's been what seems an eon, I sent out an email and despite my less than useful information, they actually got my account back. You have earned my eternal gratitude and respect FGOSupport. Also, this App is awesomesauce. Great story and even better characters. Waifus and husbandos galore."
"The game itself is fun but... Gah damn the rate up is a lie, overall the game is good and the game is generous in the gacha currency, good events and good character designs. But be warned if you are planning to play this.. *that's hell you're walking into*."
"Fantastic game imo. Great story with naturally some rotten parts, but overall still a quite good experience. No bs 30 different in-game currencies, and everything is incredibly streamlined. If you want something, you grind for it. It's as simple as that"
"The game over all isn't all to fun, and the way accounts work is that you need to have a transfer code in order to recover your account, which is BS. Since they don't even explain this which caused me to loose a lot of progress in game. And account recovery isnt reliable, due to the lack of response from support. A basic link to email would have made the game better for all players to avoid this issue"
Expensive and bad gacha rates but at least the free servants are usable.
"The game is simple to understand and play. The gacha system is less forgiving then other gacha games, but that what's makes this one unique. The story will rope you into the game and the animations of the game will leave you speech less that this is truly a mobile game."
"This game I loved playing but it locks me out of my account claiming a connection issues with I play the game normally on my phone, despite Genshin and Star Rail working. The rolls are beyond bad that it js not even the average rate. Love the story but this game is just not good so far. Something is wrong and reps don't even try to help me at all."
"Account Recovered Phone had a bad update and I had to factory reset. Lost access to my account. Emailed FGO support looking to recover my account. After a couple emails, they got me into my account in little over a day. Amazing support!"
Please give me 5 star servant
"It has been about a year now since I have sent an email to support for account retrievel and haven't gotten a reply, even with attachments showing my purchase history. I don't even want my account back now. I would just like to point out how scummy and predatory it is to make account retrievel as painful as possible to make people not want to quit and just arbitrarily decide not to respond to retrievel requests that have all the information asked for."
I loved the game and I played it on computer with bluestacks then my computer broke and I don't remember the transfer code so all my progress is gone. So overall great game but I wish I could get my progress back easier
"My favorite game. The gatcha system is kinda scary, there was times that i couldn't pull a single SSR using 500+SQ and just a couple of days ago, I pulled two featured SSR with a single multi. Characters are awesome, story is great, voice acting is top notch, best I've seen in many games. Prices for the premium SQ are a bit high, I would like them to offer discounts on their SQ shops, still the game is so awesome I wouldn't give them any lower than 5 stars."
I approb
"FGO is amazing, aside from having to grind and the gacha system with a barely functioning pity rate, this game beats any negatives over the head with all of its other positives in it's story, characters, gameplay and more. It doesn't matter if you're a diehard Fate fan or a run of the mill gacha game player, FGO won't disappoint and will keep you enthralled throughout the entire journey, every fight has meaning, every piece of scenery has meaning, everything matters, and its up to you to save it"
It's a love and hate relationship
The gacha rates are HORRIBLE! I did 40 ten pulls and only got Nero caster( limited time banner unit) from the Pity summon. For context you need to get 5 copies to max out a servant. And more context if you were to buy that many saint quartz(in game currency) you're looking at $250-$300 dollars just to get only one copy. Great story but predatory gacha rates.
Fun enough game but the grind gets a bit boring
"I quit years ago due to constant crashing, lag and freezing on THREE different brands of phones AND connections. Came back because I missed the storyline to the same problems but tolerated them until recent Nerofest updates amplified my issues to critical mass. Support was of no help whatsoever just regurgitating the same steps I already took to fix it myself. Eventually discovered the game needs 10GB free space to function decently before the lag and crashing returned. Enjoy your one star!"
I love playing FGO but there's one problem it laagy and it will freeze on Android phone I'm using a 3 phones to play it for one account 2 Androids and one iphone 7 plus this game favor iphone than android I'm using a 2 new phone with 4gb ram and 8gb and new SOC but they're laggy on the 4gb ram will freeze the game on the 8gb it's so laggy but on iphone 7 plus I can play it smoothly please make it optimize same as iphone.
"I don't know if they'll make any improvement but the graphics were the worst and fighting took a while. Gameplay is basic, art is ok; not that good because this game is about 8 years old. Overall not a pleasant experience."
NEGATIVE 1000000000--- STAR! OTHER GACHA GAMES ARE BETTER DON'T BE DRAGGED IN THIS HELL
"Crashing after lock screen about 4-5 minutes. Its make me waste time to reload game again and again. ***Your last update are not fix anything i need And now, crash again *Last update you corrected this error, i hope you will do this further better, thankyou"
I love how this is NOT a pay to win game. I'm just starting singularity 6 right now. Thank you for making this game!! The storyline always has me wanting to come back and keep playing.
"It's a good game and it's quite relaxing and enjoyable. It's somewhat f2p friendly and it's essy to understand as well. But the problem is that even though my wifi and data connections are strong, it still says 'Connection to server lost' or that the signal was too weak. Please fix this, it's hindering my in-game experience a lot especially since the loading takes so long as well."
A great game when it comes to gameplay however the biggest FLAW is the fact that I can't just use my email address to save or transfer data I've lost count of the number of time I've had to restart because I couldn't transfer my save data thankfully I never spent my but there's nothing more I Hate then losing my progress in a game 0/10
it is a wonderful game closely based on the Anime I love it
"Game is great. Customer service sucks balls. I lost my account when my old phone died and they don't have any way to bind it to facebook or playstore accounts. They then want you to remember an exhaustively annoying list of things. Who remembers their servants, friends names or favourite servant? They ask if you can remember your friend code, if my phone hadn't died with it on it I would have given it to you. Three years of play and event exclusive servants down the tubes. Lazy CS and designers."
Great game. Been playing for a year. Nothing bad to say about it
"The first couple of singulars are a bit of a drag. I've heard good things about the lost belts from my friends who got me into this game, but the start is boring. You'll need to put many hours in to get there. I've played many gacha games, and this system has some of the worst rates I've seen. The UI is terrible to navigate through. On top of that, the transfer code system is very outdated. I wish there was an account system like every other game out there. All your progress can be lost easily."
How pl UTI is you can geu
No attempt to make any improvement at all. QOL is the worst in any game I've ever played so far.
Fantastic story and amazing character designs though prepare for gacha hell. Your wallet will be dry.
I'll rate 5 star if I get Oberon today (I got him i just forgot to rate it after)
Drop rates are very low
"Tried getting into this game, but it takes up too much space. I tried transferring my save data to another device, but it didn't work. Oh well lost everything."
"One of the best gacha games out there, that is, at least for me with my rank EX luck. High quality story, a decent gameplay experience, and they fixed a lot of the game breaking bugs."
"This is game is a gacha, and one with horrible pity at that. But I still love the game I don't spend much on it, and a lot of the welfare servants are good enough to clear everything."
The game is good I'll give them that. But it will lag at the smallest things. Open the menu to fast and suddenly you have to wait 15 minutes.
The crashes on this game is becoming a problem if it's gonna keep doing this they might as well just refund people all their money and shut down the servers. While I patiently wait for a new update.
I tried this due to the hype but damn is this good if not for the server kicking out out due to events otherwise it's still impressive
I Like it
sad i cant play this game with my 2gb ram phone anymore üò≠
"I want to see this game goes bankrupt, lazy developer deserve nothing."
The amount of f2p currency you get is very little. The guarentee 5 star is only provided with 1k premium currency. But I'm pretty sure you can beat the game f2p.
I've been playing the game since it came out and have seen the game tremendously improve since its release back in 2017. I recommend the game to people unfamiliar with Type Moon's nasuverse to bring some new fans into the larger nasuverse and its many different stories. I've been a Type-moon fan since the 10th anniversary and it still remains my favorite fictional universe as a whole with its massive lore.
5-star for this game it's fun and addicting at the same time
"An interesting game and to think I started playing this because of the Saber Wars event. The story is amazing with the exception of Orleans to Okeanos. The Art is great, the ost is amazing, the gacha is a complete salt fest, the grinding is a real pain. And yet this game is extremely fun thanks to how usable the 1 to 3 stars are other than that the plethora of event is amazing even though again the grind is a pain. Really I recommend this game to people who wants to experience a great story."
Great story and characters
This is a really great game. Would definitely recommend it. Vast amount of combinations you can do in the game between servant and Craft Essences.
"The graphics is amazing, character voice line Iss cool the gamer is fun to play it just have some bugs"
Most modern games support full 60 FPS and FGO still does not support it.
K (0_o)
It's great the 1 first arc follows the anime
"Just one huge text dump after another. Story is nothing, gameplay is very basic, music is forgettable, art is ok at best, menu navigation is hell. Because this game is like 8 years old you rent heroes from players who are 100+ higher than you. Summoning is awkward and overall not a pleasant experience."
Great game if not for missons that can be played at a certain time frame as my time zone is different i would like to have it removed
"peak fiction, enough said"
I like the game so far but the main problem is is the crashing of the game I hope you'll fix it soon but anyways good gain and prove on the bug fixes
Good game bur feels extremely repetitive and lacks new content. BUT I love the fate series so can't be too angry
"Continue to come back to this game. Take my advice, don't be a fool like me! If you want to remove it from your phone temporarily, transfer the account onto your computer or something. It can be hard to recover your account."
This if one of the gacha game I really like!
the gacha rates are abyssmal and you dont get enough gems to make it worth it
I'm a big fan of Fate series üòÅüëç
"I new to this game, and I already love this game, keep up the good work !!!"
The game is fun to play event have good story and fun mechanic and.
"No new animation update to old Servants, Low Item drop rate for enhancement and the turn based mechanics is stilll as boring as ever since the day it was released. There are bunch of better games to waste your time into and FGO is not one of it"
Ackkk ü§©ü•≥ nice gameeee
So I really loved this game but lost my phone with over a year's worth of game time. There's a account recovery which I was greatful for. I was asked questions like name date of birth and a short list of servants and their class etc. After a ton of emails and tons of the info that I was asked for I was told that I still needed to provide the information. Heart broken üíî
"This game is great and I love it but since Lostbelt 6 addition it keeps crashing a lot. The most often moments of the crashes are: game start, after NP usage, new battle screen (i.e. Battle 2/3) and battle rewards loading screen. It also once crashed for me during 11x summon. I've tried clearing cache at game level, clearing cache at system level and reinstalling. Nothing helped so far. I would be very grateful if you could fix that so I can enjoy the game as I did before."
"Makes me salty af, but I love it."
"Need a better type moon multiverse game it should be like genshin impact with dub and romance options. This game is just like danmachi memoria it's not good at all, just boring"
Coudlve been a grest game. Its just hard to understand most of the things in the game
Dated
"It's a wonderful game, but even good devices have issues playing with new NP of recent character's. But still an wonderful game."
still no 5 star servant the RNG is too random
"The gameplay is pretty good, characters are all interesting renditions of historical/mythological characters with some real substance pertaining to their lore (most of the time), and the gacha is. . .fair. F2P friendly despite the gacha since the lower rarity characters can compete with higher rarities given investment. Overall a good game, and still holds up as the granddaddy of gacha."
I love FGO waifus
The story mode is really good and the lostbelt
Best writing out of all gachas by far
Get gud
cool
Artoria
Fun game love it
Good gameplay and story.
Fun game good gameplay and great story but awful gacha
Fun game
"It's a Gacha game, one where f2p people can get far with the less powerful units, but only if you take the time fully them to at least max level and max their skills. They've done a good deal of reworking since my first post. It's even more f2p friendly now."
I got even reimbursed with a lot of good summons. I'm good now.
Melusine
great story and lore Better than HSR
The game is good and epic story relling is a bit off but iverall still ome of the best games
"It is actually a very good game with memorable characters coupled with an amazing story. Getting high rarity servants is quite hard for free to play players, but I got lucky and got 3 5-star servants, so can't complain that much. The only real problem I have with FGO is the waiting time before each missions or battles, I get that they still need to ready character sprites and all that, but it really is a very long wait. I'd rather download a lot of data for each servant. Update: Fast Loading!!"
"It's greedy, a little selfish, and hit or miss for gameplay... but at least the story is enjoyable and the off content fun."
This is good game But the gacha and grinding (material and money aka. QP) is so dang hell
Let the salt flows
"Loving it, waiting for Aesc"
Saber is best girl.
game sucks
astolfo üëç
"Mash finished her enemies with ease, but she also Finished Me. (‚Å† ‚Å†Íàç‚Å†·¥ó‚Å†Íàç‚Å†)"
Laggy. Takes 30sec - 1 min. Loading every single fight
"Been playing since 2019. No issue except freezing at some point, the SSR rates and the grind on this game is insane. If you wanna play a turn based game with insanely sweaty balls grind. You must play this game"
"Arguments may have started, but who cares? Good game, i constantly recommended it to my friends."
Most challenging gacha with superb storyline and animation
"Thx i get oberon,plz give me morgan,last day"
One of the best game with interesting plot
Loved the story line and the universe Music is a joy Character depth feels like they're my friends family The community and dev is caring Overall i love everything about it üòä
"I've had a great experience playing this game. I wish it was easier to find specific friends support servants, but that doesn't subtract from the fun. And while the gacha rates aren't the best, that just makes it better when you manage to pull any gold servant."
"This game has the best story for mobile games. There's no contest. I've read genshin, and looked at arknights, haven't checked out star rail but it doesn't matter. This games story is so head and shoulders above everything else it's not even funny. The character designs are incredible, the battle system is tedious but does have depth to it. Ultimately, I would only recommend this game for the long grind, not for casual players."
"The grind is real. Have not experienced any game errors yet so as of now its going pretty well. Gameplay can be a bit repetitive but it's still fun imo. Story-wise, it is incredibly interesting and i enjoyed reading thru the story."
"Very encouraging changes being made since Lasengle took over, and I'm optimistic on the future for this game."
"Well, it's a very difficult sensation write about this game. Everybody knows that this game is one of the hardest for get a SSR character and that would be a very bad thing but is so cool that I can't hate it. The Story, characters, music, art, voices... The whole game is so cool that I can't hate it. Yes, the rates are trash but with effort and don't spend in all banners is possible get the characters that you want. It's only an administration job"
Would've been 5star if there's auto battle/skip battle feature
Awful
"Rejoice! The living cancer of humankind, the avatar of stingy greedy corp!! THIS IS THE WORST GACHA GAME ON THIS ENTIRE FREAKING PLANET (in term of gacha rate and rate up banner). DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IS CANCER GAME!! While character design is absurdly good and story is topnotch (e.g. Babylonia arc). If you still care about your sane sanity and healty mind, try other game for christ sake. The game will tryin to lure you, the more servants you have, the harder you tryin to quit, Trust me!!"
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars. (Only real ones know)
Always lagging even on a modern smartphone
When is FGO gonna add an account system
i have been unable to play the game for the past week. my game crashes as soon as it tries to load in
More and more difficult to recommend as it gets older. Play Limbus Company instead of you're just after a good story since the story is the only reason I can think to stick around in fgo at this point and the writing in fgo ha been very inconsistent.
Good luck dealing with their support
"Combat is decent, animation is good, can skip cutscenes. That's it though. No auto battles, can't skip ultimates you've seen 50+ times. Have to play same mission 3-6 times just to move on to another one for 3-6 times but the chapter has 15+ sections so you're on same chapter for a good 45+ minutes cuz you can't skip anything but cutscenes. And the free side quests after you beat that one section you gotta do those 3 time to get 1 crystal you can't use till you get 3 to summon something useless."
Hey there's a glitch where the screen goes black after you open the game and I wait for like 15 to 20.mins and nothing happens
One of the best story rich games in a long time.
"The thing i hated the most characters are designed inaccurate and unfaithfully to the original person or original source like for example shuten doji is a NOT A 5 FOOT LOLI shuten doji is and always was male,ugly and a abusedly gross Ogre/Oni and Leonardo DaVinci is a MALE AND LATIN GUY and napoleon is not a badass he was more of stuck up military jerk. It sucks the immersion out when you portray history and mythology wrong. As a history and mythology lover THIS HURT ME ALOT"
Gilgamesh crashes me
Super bad nobody download it
"Story is mid, gameplay gets stale fast The part I find the most fun in this game is the collecting"
500 SQ no Merlin. 330 SQ no Douman. 150 SQ no Godjuna. 780 SQ no Oberon
Simply the best of the gatcha games
"Please update gameplay, having to do the same card combos every round is exhausting. Story and characters have soul, but gameplay is repetitive and boring."
"Just dont touch this game, play other game like star rail thats better game option"
"I got Vitch and Oberon, but no Morgan and Albion."
"playing game to reliefs stress, but this game just added more stress in my life, sigh..."
I love it ^-^
Well since the root issue has long been fixed it wouldn't be right to judge the game based on that anymore. I'll leave it at a 4 until I dip my toes in the water some more.
"Awesome, sold my soul to the Inner Sea of Salt in 2017 and haven't stopped. If you wanna mald rolling this is the game"
i like the funny anime girls :)
I can't connect to the game server even though our wifi doesn't have a problem. I even tried on my other phone and still can't connect
predatory still

"Came for the story. Stayed for the story. Don't take those 1 stars reviews that says low gacha rates. Yeah the gacha rates are low but SQ(item needed to roll) are almost everywhere in the game Yeah but the only problem for me is freezing, sometimes after 20-30 minutes, the game will freeze."
Like the game play....
Hell game love it you'll lose everything if ur unlucky
Gacha is bad civ
Well I would like to give this game 1üåü but it want let me. my game keeps glitching and kicking me off all the time! This is ridiculous!
An entire year later lol
douman pretty
"one word, voyager."
Exceptional experience
Don't know where my money go.. ü´†
"I failed Oberon, here's a 5*"
Beeg woman make brain go brrrrrrr
"Im changing it to 5 star cuz even you give me bunch of 4/5 star ce, i love this game üò°üòäüëç"
"I downloaded this game and it keeps saying failed to connect to the sever despite i tried everything but it weirdly works in I use a Japanese vpn for it but if i switch it off,it will completely stop working (i tried reinstalling it,checking my wifi and storage and cleaning my cache ) so what should i do??? Please fix this issue!!"
500+ sq no oberon. Gim tai üòÆ‚Äçüí®
"What's with all the freezing? Fix your ""app"""
üò∞You monsters!!!?my email is usually how I get back into the game you took that away from me I don't remember ever seeing password because I was just jump in the game this is cruel and unusual punishment
Very good to the point I hate it
Its good I just wish the gacha rates were better.
"Love the graphics, storyline (singularity and lostbelts), new weapon turret on mash shield on storylines. I save saint quartz and use them on very difficult battles."
"Games fun, wish I could support since I love this series. I refuse to pay companies that can't add proper save mechanics. I've lost money and time with this style of save before. Edit 7/2023: Deleting this. *2nd time I lost my save because my phone was damaged. Never playing this game ever again and never playing any game with with outdated saving methods!!"
My account is lucky ! ! !
"The power creep in this game has gotten insane. It's gotten to the point where you have to build teams specifically built to get through bosses, and even then, you will likely get hit by a full party wipe attack."
"Beutifule story, and fun characters. that's about it."
Aside from the Gacha and the first four singularities being either awful to average. Quality of the game does greatly improve after these segments and the constant updates have given better quality of life changes. It's good. 3/5 Update: Game's current state and ownership changed to Lasengel and they've made a number of massive improvements across the board in qol. But most importantly lost belt 6 released and it gave us the best fate story if not one of the best rpg stories in long time! 4/5
"Greatly saddened. Started up the app after a while of inactivity. I transferred my data to my current phone so I know I had everything. But now I am starting from scratch. I was in the Lost Belts. I had so many High rarity servants that took me forever to get to where they were, and now it is all missing. Soul crushing to have lost them all. Update: Without three pieces of information, they were not able to recover my account. Friend code, last transfer code, and Master name."
A great time untill it quit working. I really enjoyed playing this game but very recently it has stopped letting me play and I've already cleared my cache and even uninstalled it and it still doesn't work. Well got it to work but now I have to start all over again so got to drop my rating üò≠
Fate ü§¢
bruh I play this for 1 week it didn't give me a 5 star yet
Best Game Ever
That fact that almost everything is based on 1 shotting is so lame
I love the story of this game keep it up the good work ‚ù§Ô∏è
Edit: Oberon banner came! Which means more data to be downloaded which also means the crashing becomes more and more frequent. I'm currently on Lost belt 6 and I can't even finish a single node after the recent update for the oberon banner. I hope this gets seen by the NA devs cause its really bothersome to play fgo with it crashing 60% of the time.
"I kept playing this game not because of it's mechanics, strategy, or visuals which were all great and an absolute blast to interact with. I kept playing because of the imperfect perfect storyline. Perfect because it offered characters with every single personality you can think of that really built off each other in their own respective storyline. Basic upgrade materials and currency were not the things that pushed me to finish the quests it was the masterful character development."
Great gameplay amazing story and pretty and cool charactersüòç
"Been a fate fan for god knows when, so this game is a blessing and a curse for all fate and gacha addicts alike, like me. Story: 10/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Characters: 10000000/10 Keep up the great work lasagna!!!üíØ"
"While the game itself is worth playing for husbandos, it is not worth spending money. The amount you get per purchase is stupidly low if you spend 3.99 you will only receive like 5 saint quartz, it's not worth spending money if your a low spender like me, just grind stages and save up for your fav servant(s). I only wish if skip tickets can be handed out, even if they're just gained through events or missions (similar to how bungo stray dogs hands them out)."
"This game is not for you. If you are just getting into fgo, you will eventually hit an experience that makes you wonder if you're playing the game wrong, or multiple such experiences. This is because you havent either been playing for free from launch, or else arent whaling so hard that captain ahab returned from the dead as your exclusive servant. There are simply some encounters that will ruin this game for you, and the longer you waited to join, the more you'll get punished."
I love this game but why are they censoring words? Please stop doing this!
I wish they added a Google play service since I lost my progress when I accidentally uninstalled fgo
ASTOLFO
They have the worst login and transfer system it is 2023 and they are so behind and unwilling to get better by using Google login or FB login. I regret any money I put into this game and time cause due to losing a phone I lost all my progress. I will never play this game or support this franchise again. I recommend do not invest time or money in this game play something better like star Rail or genshin impact.
"With the growing pool of servants in the banners to roll from, its harder and harder to get the ones that are on ""rate up"". The rate up is a lie and you literally have to spend 'X' amount of money if you really want a specific servant. Rate up is a lie The story is great dont get me wrong, but its a gatcha, and it'll ""gatcha by the wallet"" if they release someone youll want."
FIX THE GOD DAM DROP RATE FOR THE BANNERS NOW!
"Lack of QoL updates,bad rates,and poor direction led me to unistall this game after several years. Not worth the time or money."
Cannot pay for saint quartz
"My game is bugging even when it's connected to internet, it won't load at all fails every time it tries to connect to the wifi. Please fix the bug or just my game in general I would like to play again and I've been trying for days now to play :("
"gacha suck, gib free 5* ticket ill change this to rating 5 ^edit(i took tamamo from the giveaway ticket changed it to 3* now, give another) 07/11/23 changed it 4star; give another 5* servant i'll change it to 5star review"
konyanskaya pls :>
"I gacha too much, i need to commit np 5 summer abby Update: got her to np 5, the fbi is watching my every move now."
Come on the game can't work plss developers fix it it always couldn't enter the game fix it come on respond plsss
Fgo sucks Does not give sq's
"So this game is fun, story is great compared to other Gacha's I have played. For a while felt burnt out by the game. But took a break and am enjoying it once more. Thankfully for some of the QoL has improved the game from its initial launch"
Laggy and always crashes.
Got the white screen issue...sigh Hope the issue will be fix soon
Your rate is suck. ü§¨ü§¨ 720sq no ssr.
"I absolutely love this game, wouldn't recommend"
fix your game it freezes and lags constantly and thats when it launches at all it shouldnt take a super computer to run a freaaken moble game!
"Unironically developed a gambling addiction while playing this ""game"" I was rationalizing how many days I could go without eating so I could buy more pulls. Spent 2.5k and still couldn't pull jalter, one good thing came from that, it reformed me. I've despised gacha in all forms since. And haven't spent a PENNY in a gacha since. Don't play the game, don't spend a dime. You can get all the pngs used in the game for free on Google. Seriously, buying a hentai visual novel is a better purchase."
Still great.
"I got Koyanskaya. Best game. Download it for the foot fetish event in the next 2 years. Thank you, Lasagna."
I love this game the story is amazing all the characters are viable to use the graphics are dope and gameplay is very fun once you assemble a team the only issue is the uptick in crashes after the recent updates but a fix for that is sister for later this year
Ccewf
rate up is a lie :((((((
van gogh best girl
"A well-balanced game. Gives you a lot of free stuff but rates are kinda bad. Story is pretty well-written overall, especially for the later arcs. The best thing has to be the aesthetics. Jokes about waifus and fan-service aside, the newer character designs and animation are quite appealing."
"I love the game when it works, but I have to restart it 10 times to get it to work. It refuses to rotate to landscape properly"
6 years anniversary currently going on and the best they can do is give you a couple multis to toss at your 1% chance of obtaining a limited 5* servant. The story is mid with some high points but it doesn't matter when the way the game works makes it feel like an absolute slog to get through. For me this game has the least player friendly practices outside of adding qol once a year. The pity for one copy of a unit is about 400$ give or change and if they are dps units they need dupes.
"The story is good, the gacha system is a real deal gamble. But yeah once you play the game there is no escape. I'll be looking forward for more amazing stories. dmn I'm having luck issue. haven't pull most of the ssr that i want even with how much i spend or roll. my effort was in vain in farming. and whaling so much taking its toll. :("
Enjoyable.
I love to play anime games on music and I love to play anime new games on my phone lol.
It's a great game and all I would had giving 5 if it wasn't for kicking me out cause first it's good and stuff when I click a battle it glitches or freezes but I can only play so little
The gacha rates are awful. Just another app wanting more money and still not giving you the character you want. Now they lock past servants behind paid quarts. Not free quarts. Update: All these different categories are only paid quarts now. Not worth it.
I have a better chance to have a date with your mum than getting a wanted 5 star
I love this game 10/10
This game is pure grief don't play it. Pity is very much non-existent.
this game made me insane.
Best mobile game ever!
"480 saint quartz, 30 summon tickets. No Koyanskaya, only pain."
worst gacha ever
"Extremely predatory. You're more often than not to get useless junk than characters from the gatcha system, meaning that even a whale would likely be required to put in an exorbitant amount of money for the slight chance of having any of the characters they actually want. The tutorial is also far too long without any option to skip it completely. Massive disappointment."
Terrible game if i could give it less than one star i would
Terrible seeing as all i get when i load the game is a white screen. Could the develepors do something about that please? Why do you players in Japan unlock rank up quests before us North American players that isn't fair!!!üò†üò†üò† I can't load up the game again. You developers need to do something about this
"Haven't finished the show, but i like this turn base game. If you can recomend predownloading in options because its occasionally slow."
"The game is nice overall except a wonky pity system with questionable rate? Idk Also I cant buy Saint quartz in my region which is very inconvenience, pls fix this so i can enjoy the game once more"
can't log.in because of the game server issues
6th anniversary yay let me give you all these currency to roll and you get nothing because pity doesn't carry over and you need to 300 pulls to get pity. as the years pass by i thought this game would become more forgiving with its gacha but it just wants you to spend money. Great game but i hate the gacha to a point where i really need to consider quitting and play something else
"anniversary coming in with 2 unscheduled, no notice, no ETA sudden maintenance, with a bug that basically gave you a bunch of free pulls, only if you were a whale. rather than equally handing out quartz that the whales gotten basically for free, they rolledback the quartz that they've gotten, not realising those who exploited this and rolled all of that immediately get no downside, while everyone else who wasn't in on it got only 5 quartz as compensation"
"Dear developer, if you make it available in Indonesian playstore, sure you will get much money. Believe me"
My fave gacha of all time but gacha rates still sucks.
"It's very fun with lots of great story. Just look up how to get started online because if you go in blind it's much more difficult. Reroll the starter banner for Heracles and ""follow"" 3 people in the support list with maxed out servants that are high on online tier lists, can only follow in first 10 levels then you can never follow again so pick 3 good people early on and you'll have no problems."
"I love the game, but recently it's been glitching. The background and characters don't appear and I have to restart it. I just updated the game today and it keeps crashing whenever I try to do a summoning roll"
The game is still nice as ever with a great adventure
Zero gameplay
Love it but I would like the battle system to be a little better and for the characters to look cooler
"Story is good, but the rate up is bad."
"Been playing for a while now and seemed the character pulls got low, but doing the guaranteed 5 star summon AND the 5 star choice ticket for this event, great job devs. Not sure if new players get all that, but its worth trying. If ur thinking of trying the game, nows the time."
"No way to link your account and if you lose it, You're pretty much out of luck. I lost my account and with all the info I gave them, It was still deemed not recoverable. Story is great but other than that, Its horrible. Great for killing time but not worth investing it."
"Play it for the story the stories writing improves immensely after about singularity 5 , the combat is satisfying but it's a slow grind. You don't need many 5 stars technically but let's be real you are here to roll waifu/husbando."
FVCJ THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE (i love it)
"If you can hold on for the first few story chapters, you will get to where it gets good and lose your life to this game."
"This game is great, I love the storyline,its an emotional rollercoaster that has even had me crying, and the ridiculous yet entertaining events. The characters designs/history are perhaps the best part of the game (at least for me). Not to mention the phenomenon voice actors that bring each character to life. However, the gatcha is a hell that you cannot escape from, so be responsible and don't roll on every banner that catches your interest. Overall, I would strongly recommend playing."
"Gacha rates have always been awful but I finally got burnt out with how bad they are and the ""pity"" is hardly one"
"Enjoying it since it was released, proud to be one of the 1st 100k people to play this 1st b4 it went viral :)"
"Please fix the sound issue....... Edit: So the sound issue got fixed but it took so long for them to fix... Either way, im happy that they fixed it and im giving it a 5 star for now..."
It won't let me get into it. It keeps telling me to update the app when I already have.
"5* simply because it's Fate, and the storytelling is great. There are plenty downsides in terms of gameplay and gacha rates, but meh, I don't care, I'm here for the story, and I'm enjoying every bit of it. Gameplay is still very much enjoyable, even though I was never a fan of strategy games. Only thing I'd wish for is Account system and being able to play on different devices without losing one of them."
"Kys, rate up is a lie"
Good game dose crash some times tho UWU
"A bad game with gacha rate , I lost 200 quartz and get nothing in return"
"ABSOLUTE TRASH - Want to play a game where you can spend 1000$'s of dollars worth of currency and not even get a single SR/4* Character? Then this is for you!!! The disgusting gacha system overshadows any good this game has. Which is honestly just the story, the gameplay is extremely dated and stale. Do yourself a favor and play something else, watch story videos on YouTube or something. I say this as a huge type moon fan."
"6th Anniv Salt. No Muramasa, no Arthur, no Ibuki, no Morgan, no Melusine, no Koyan. Wow. Thank you so much. The last SSR that i got is God Caren. I think its time to quit for good. ü•≤"
"I love the game but my problem is you have to have a recovery code instead of having it save to a google account or other accounts its so hard specially when you forgotten the password of that code and or your phone breaks which is unpredictable I couldn't recover my old account because my game ID, and pass was on my old phone that my brother breaks."
Doesn't work and keeps on shutting down the app before I can even play it.
It's the only gacha game I continue to play.
"I love the game, eventhough the gacah system is the less lucky one"
"The problem is the rate of getting a 5 star,it's to low"
That's hell you're walking into kid.
The game's story is very intriguing and engaging that I can't help but find out what happens next. My only problem is how you play the game and that its looks like Art based Servants are the most effiecient for a party. There is also how hard it is to gain Servants here and there. Otherwise the game is above average at best.
Good gacha gambling chance and vision novel and if deleted your game by accident and did not take down the issued number you could just ask/email the game team
OMG REALLY SO GOOD I RECOMMENDED THIS GAME GACHA THIS IS THE BEST GACHA GAME I PLAYED I LIKE THE STORYS AND THE GAMEPLAY AND THE ANIMATION AND GRAPHICS SO AWESOME!!!!!!
"FGO is a travesty; it's a cheap, outdated, shameless scam that appeals to no one but degenerates. The Fate franchise as a whole is littered with promotions for such unsavory practices as rape, pedophilia, and defamation. (I.E: they put children in lewd outfits and feature tasteless depictions of abuse victims as their Valentine's day mascots.) The entire Type-Moon brand is an embarrassing mess of unfiltered garbage; the Inbred weebs who support them should feel ashamed and deserve bullying."
"Straight up been playing fate for 6 years. Sometimes we will spend a few weeks apart, but our love is eternal. I always come back. Must have transfered this game across 10 new phones haha. Must try but def watch a quick youtube vid of you are new to fate"
"I am a fan of fate anime and decided to play their game for 3 years. Today one of the best supports in the game came out and as always I couldn't invoke it, I spent 557 qs adding the ones I bought were 600. Today I'm leaving this game because I don't have a support to help me advance in the game. They have an amazing story but the Gatcha system sucks, three years without support and I have not been able to advance the story. I will keep an eye on the story of the game cause it is very good ."
"Good game. Gacha hell, sure, but also good."
It's Good but the gacha is so Difficult
"I've loved this game since the minute I picked it up several years ago, even had a login streak as long as I've played, never missed a day. But now the app refuses to work, and the game has become completely unplayable. And I can't even re download the app because then I'll lose my save data. This app needs a massive overhaul. When it works it's great though."
poggers
Should of got into this game sooner.

60fps mode finally
Update 8/23: New event and game still repeatedly crashes
Ritsuka really has Ex-rank luck
Good very good no salt. But suffering from success
My favorite mobile game of all time. Gacha is a bit costly tho..
Disrespectful gacha system. Will give 0 stars. Ruins grinding and hard work. Will never spend money on this game again. Not recommended to cash or even waste your time.
I'm down bad y'all.
Terrible gacha rate
This game is great because it has koyanskaya and oberon! Great game would recommend
"This game is good althought my wifi suck buts it's still good(Old review) (New review) the game itself is very good i never encountered a single bug although, sometimes my game stops but i can still play it and the service of developers are very helpful"
It's more of a visual novel with Sim aspects more than a game if u like spend alot of time and mabye money of a chance of collecting your 2d fictional women then sure join
"Returning player and forgot there is no account linking, but am having a blast replaying the old zones"
Best mobile game
Great story. Fun engaging game play. Latest update introduced improved graphics but it only works on newer phone models. The summoning is hell. After the initial saint quarts start dash roll out and a year. It becomes hell to get anything above a three star. I have went ten months between new servants and craft essences.
"A good game, but has been crashing almost constantly from the Webview bug. Until it's fixed, I can't recommend this to anyone with a Samsung phone."
"So. I started playing this because a friend dragged me into it. But it has turned out to be genuinely good. The gameplay can be a little same-y after a while. But don't skip the story. It's entertaining and the learn to play manga that was made with it has many meme worthy moments of hilarity. As to the paid aspect... welll. Of course it's going to hurt. But asside from maybe two banners a year where it is paid only, you can earn enough saint quartz ingame to play for free. Over all. 10/10."
"The game might look simple but if you're hooked to the story, you'll also be hooked to the gameplay. The game is generous when it comes to resources and servants. Great story and great characters. Superb game. Not a pay to win game."
FGO BEST GAME 2023
Lots of Cute and Funny Characters üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Nag maintenance nung naglalaro ako, di ko makukuha rewards kasalanan nyo to"
masterpiece
smh still enjoying<3
"Love the game, love the anime, i love fate series"
Great story and characters gacha could be better for getting specific items
Other than the atrocious gacha system the game is fun with its turn based combat along with its wonderful animation all coming together to tell such a great story
Okayge really cool old game
"After a year playing this game I can say this is the most fun I've had playing in a turn-based game, the gacha is unforgiving I zeroed out many times, however the story is good and it gets better after the later chapters, every character has it's own gimmicks and the gameplay is simple just pick three cards, use the skills, then try your best to kill the enemy as quickly as possible overall love this game, however they should really implement a skip np animation for farming it."
Best game because of Artoria
Chill game sessh for F2P until you fight bosses. Battle of the lifetime or maybe im just bad at it but still everything is enjoyable. Thanks for making this game accessible for a broke bloke like me
Love the new servants and other stuff they did to the game and is f2p friendly if you wanna go that route
"It's an amazing experience to use some of the carictors, especially Hercules he's my favorite. All the noble fantasims look so cool and detailed, definitely worth a try."
It's a good game. A little expensive though.
"Story is absolutely incredible and the most recent chapters (Lostbelt 6) is one of the most well written works of fiction I've had the pleasure of reading. The game play and design could be better, but if you're getting into this gatcha game, you are primarily here for the franchise and the story and on that front, there's no competition from any other game out there."
I like sabers name Altria pendragon. Altria is right translation of artoria I was soo happy when I seen Altria caster in lb6
Love the story. Wish it had a pity system.
I Got SSR
Pls Oberon
Have a bug of front babylon aria seventh singularity
Amazing character design
Melusine <3
"There is no bound account in this game so the moment you uninstall the game then you lose all your progress as well 5 star servants, I lost my Hassan because of this"
I spend 25 dollar and saved it and got a password but it's I must put something in but I hate having to start all over everytime
"Best gacha on the market. Wait, I heard gacha? Gacha? Where gacha? Gacha, gacha, gacha"
Fun game it take while to get hook but the story interesting if you read it and it's very big on strategy.
not f2p friendly drop rate sucks not worth of time.
My fav game so far
"Really fun game, great and interesting characters and story. It has one of the *harshest* gacha systems Ive ever seen; but I feel that enough SQ(the in game currency) is given that you can get characters that you want, as long as you don't dump into every banner to roll around"
I've been with FGO for around 4 years now and have only recently had problems with connecting to the game. Not sure whether it's connection or my phone (S10e) but regardless I'll keep playing and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the Fate series!
"Played for 5 years by now. Its quality has dropped since Act II. The translations have occasional spelling and grammar mistakes in them, which should not be the case since Aniplex and Type-Moon are involved. The game has developed a habit of crashing for no discernable reason over the last half year or so, which is odd since the game otherwise runs smoothly; I run it on a current-gen smartphone. Gacha is trash but that's to be expected. Gameplay loop is entertaining at best and mundane at worst."
GO JP
I just like fate
No comment
"Help I have been trying to connect for the past few days, but am unable to for reasons unknown. My wifi and phone used to run the game just fine before the update, now it just keeps trying to connect and it has been 2 hours and still nothing. I have cleared data and cache and also redownloaded the game several times and nothing works. Pls help"
I'm having issues with it right now I went to do a 10x summons and it takes my gems and closes application and doesn't give me the characters it just took my gems I'd give it 5 stars other than this
"Make no mistake: many of the game's reviews come from its earlier inception, where it was balanced and playable, and the storyline focused on fun. Now it goes out of its way to kill you instantly so you have to use purchasable game currency to continue, and many of the events force you into endless grinding the same exact fight over and over to achieve anything. The story has zero agency: everything is always too powerful even when you beat it, and you must always be saved. More review soon."
1 year no new ssr no sense of rewarding the old playera
"If you willing to slog through the first story arc, you will be in the ride of your lives. Also, this is hell you will be walking into."
Ufss tener paciencia y tendr√°s buenas cosas
"The game, the story and the equity is extremely good but can i make a request, rather than visiting the gift and the enhancing section, can you make a space on the middle part where the money and SQ are shown and are switching if that is possible"
Nice...?
Great game. This is my favorite. Don't play it if you value your life and sanity.
Right on
Great story. I play a lot before. To much time to farm make me quit playing this game. If only they add auto ai to farm like how grand summoners did. Then I probably gonna keep playing.
"Am a previous player that only recently redownloaded the game after getting a new phone. At first it worked perfectly, transfered over my account and game was running smoothly, fast forward a day later and tried running the game again, black screen, waited but the black screen wouldn't leave, cleared cache, still black, restarted device, still black screen. Really frustrated right now as it was working perfectly at first."
The game is alright
Total scam. Money hungry pay to win game.
I think my account is banned from actually getting any 4 or 5 stars from the banner. Haven't seen a banner servant in 500 sq.
Low 5star summon
I need 5 stars ü§ßü§ß
"Does not have link set up where I originally linked it on Facebook and Google play and when I came back to start it, I have no progress saved."
Very poor gacha rates. The worse pity system of all gacha game's ever.
anime girls innit
"I have played this game for a couple of years now and have always justified its abhorrent gacha rates with a good storyline however that is now being challenged by other games who have a good storyline as well as a fair gacha system. Once upon a time, I would've said that FGO was one of the best games I have played but no, that is no longer the case and it has finally made its way to the bottom of my list."
"games story is great, characters are great. but the rates hurt alot. And can completely kill motivation to play, its absurd they continue to stick to archaic rates while other games that are making more are moving to be more forgiving. Gacha games are only as fun as the characters u get, hopefully this game changes or dies soon"
Imagine hell but a relatively fun version of hell with historical waifus and husbandos.
I like this game.
It's a game
"Been fan of fate for quite sometime. Yes this is gatcha game however, this game has true story and characters you truly will fall in love with. So do I recommend game if you are fan or getting into because of anime (as well as movies) Also it's good time to join since rate up is going be S tier this year Plus some good rerun events from BB event to NEW SUMMER EVENT PLUS CASTORIA"
One of the best mobile games and definitely the best story in mobile games!!!
I enjoy the stories and the Heroic Spirits
üò≠
The game is fun but it continuously either kicks me out in the middle of a battle or it won't even bring me to the game at all just a black screen
Thanks üôè For Get Back My Account ‚ô•Ô∏è
Lag and crash
Keep getting frozen or a black screen.
"I love this game, the story is amazing and the characters are very cool"
"In my opinion, this is the best gacha game. FGO's characters have more depth and lore to them than any other gacha who mostly focus on waifus. Most gacha's stories/ lore don't stay interesting but FGO's story consistantly keeps me on the edge of my seat. Gameplay is definitely unique to all others. Only bad things I have to say about FGO are its droprates. I would also like to be able to interact with our servants more."
Hello I will now f2p this game may I burn in salt from gacha hell
This game is fun
one of the best moble games
Very nice.
This game bro üò≠ 540sq and no castoria dawg
I dont hate the game or anything there is particularly something i hate in this game not the graphics or anything what i hate is the data transfer of the game. I have lost 10 acc that i played for more than 50 days and everytime i come back i always lost may progress
why are yall using ai slop in your animated trailers lol you guys make so much money
thank you for 3 rolls morgan
Simply amazing. Best gacha game ever created.
this game is garbage!!
"Fantastic game apart from EU being scammed on SQ prices and more and more typos cropping up in their translations, which makes it feel a little low effort for what it is."
"the story is amazing and i love the characters, it's almost 5 stars but in my opinion the craft essence rate is to high for summons, and it would be nice to have character pool and craft essence separated."
P2w to the moon
"Performance 2/10, gacha system 0/10, gameplay 7/10. Honestly just don't spend your money on this game, at the very least until they fix game performance. As it stands they don't deserve your dollar"
Fate of an Average Order | 6.0/10 | While there is a solid combat system; the narrative is far-fetched and uninteresting. Unlocking new characters is exciting as they are interesting but that is downplayed by the cumbersome menu and user interface design. I would only recommend this to hardcore gacha enthusiasts.
Very very very long loading time. Very long. Just getting into a stage and organizing units before starting wastes a lot of time. Fix your loading time.
"Nice game, but recently it won't allow me to load into the game"
"Just got the game 3 days ago and it wouldn't allow me to login after my 1st time playing, it would just be stuck on a white screen. Edit: the game stopped doing that after multiple tries, not changing my rating because as it turns out the game is just boring."
Love the game. Even got one of my favorite servants. Though I am confused. I'm guessing the north American version of this game doesn't have any way to redeem codes?
I dropped my life savings on this game...
"A really bland, personality void gacha games in an already crowded market. Animation is clunky and remniscent of early browser games. Lacks any sort of polish and comes off as very lazily made. Had high hopes for this game as i like the series but it met the minimum expectations which is a shame."
Not player friendly. Forcing players to leave the game by puting ridiculously strong enemies or forcing you to only use a char that is weak against enemy. Take the fun out of enjoying the game.
I love the game and the stories and I like the fact that when I deleted it saved all my progress I'm y grateful for that overall 10/10 but I wish u didn't need 30 saint quartz just for only 11 summons
"would be nice if it wasn't for the too- much-loading issue. i had to wait for a few minutes, because it keeps on loading. a waste of time, and a waste of battery parcentage. for the summoning part, i am so disappointed. it just stucks there and there's no ""skip"" or ""next"" button to click which is very very confusing. now, i get why the review of this game is too low compare to other games I've played. i just hope that the issues I've mentioned would be resolve."
Drop rates are ridiculously low. Gameplay is boring.
The game didn't close properly and erased my game all my servant's I had acquired over the past year.
My game sometimes it's stuck at loading page when start app I can't start the game i have to wait for reset time . That made me miss login streak . Any idea to fix this?
"I'll admit, I've wasted a ton of money on this game. But did I have fun, yes, I've played for years now and don't plan on stopping. These reviews on crashes and freezing I've never experienced, I still highly recommend this game to anyone out there who loves anime. But it will slowly edge you twords a gambling addiction not gonna lie"
I have not been able to login since the last update and I don't know why or what to do
The game literally keeps crashing at the last node of Solomon like come on! If it gets fixed 5 star Update it fixed itself after updates.
Definitely one of the Most Epic Games of All Time!!!
"Updated review: Would have deleted this game long ago if it wasn't for the story, characters, and world building. Absolute worst gacha system in the genre (330 summons for a pity that doesn't carry over). Work on improving the game itself is extremely slow. Many servants need buffs and/or animation updates but are just neglected. This game has so much potential but it's squandered by the developers greed and complacency. Don't bother with this game unless you love Fate or are a whale."
"Lasengle is bad, don't support them"
My life has been worse off because of this game. 10/10 would recommend.
"It's really dumb that it makes you downland the update before the start screen, I'm trying to transfer my data to a new device, but I have to update the game in the old one to do that, which I obviously won't play in anymore. That's bad design"
Brilliant game and game play and graphics
"yeah no, everyone who gave it a 5 star is downright a masochist for sure. the gacha rates are so bad I'd rather touch grass."
Best game ever
Muramasa √ßƒ±kmazsa 1 yƒ±ldƒ±z atarƒ±m Edit: 400 sq yinede √ßƒ±kmadƒ±
Good plot
Amazing game
"Does not reward players for their time, save 150 sq I get nothing, save 500sq I get nothing and you'll know how long it takes to get that amount if you play. Had good story at some parts but that's all there is to this game. They will deliberately make you fail on your pulls so you end up spending."
"I've been playing a little over a year now, and I still find this game awesome and outstanding to play with. 10/10 would definitely recommend"
Awesome work as always!
gameplay is not it bro there's no way around it plus this thing's clearly not optimized but every arc following camelot goes hard
"Very good game, engaging and fun"
I can't wait for the lb6
"Bastante entretenido. Creo que el costo del gacha es muy elevado, pero se puede jugar sin meter dinero. Es uno de los pocos gachas que realmente entretienen."
the best game i ever played
"I Absolutely love the Fate series, and this game is absolutely amazing."
Artoria beats Goku
"Great story, hard gacha."
"I don't know how long i played but its still super good though!!! Heheh, waiting for Morgan"
"I love playing this game .The only things I dislike are the framing for ascension materials for characters and the AP needed to do quests and the number of times the game freezes or crashes.Other than that, I really like this game."
I like it
I really like the game but i can't play it as it always the application didn't launch properly or failed to connect to the game server I haven't even play for so long like I only once play it
Great fun.
"The writing has been fun, seeing how many of these characters would basically act in a more modern world while falling with the main story threat. Of course, you have to deal with a GOOD NUMBER of heroes being gender swapped, but that's been par for the course. The biggest problem is how flashy it can be, and by that, I mean getting blinded by a bright flash of white screen and some having some intense flickering effects, with no way to tone down either, so you have to be careful with your eyes"
Poopoo
"Should always have at least 3-5 quartz per day like the beginner rewards, made the game a lot more fun"
"Horrible, p2w garbage,drop rate are horrible, you will never get a 4 to 5 start. Anyone who claim that not a true I got some many, you are just salty you didn't got any are delusional or have horrible gambling addiction that they can see the true, even though is in from of they face. Average consumer's now days are too stupid to control themselves and they will put money on anything similar to Slot machine just to satisfy their addiction."
Stupid trash game bad üñïüëé
Can you guys fix the freezing for this game. It's so annoying that I couldn't play properly. My phone is already on high specs so I don't see the issue on why the heck it's always freezing! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
Bs gacha system other than that beautiful
"The frustration that how many times you roll you cant get the servant that you want. You need ssr luck for this game or thats just how the game is. Anyway i can't stop myself to play this game, it's addictive(for diehard Fate fans). Most recommended game. Thank you developers."
This game loves to freeze up whenever I start playing and it would be that way for minutes. It's fun to play but the game freezing constantly makes it not fun to play. 3 stars.
"I hate that you have to remember a number code to retrieve your account due to this, and not knowing that it would not save my account through Google play or anything I lost my account that I worked hard for, other than that it's an ok rpg."
most character
Lost ALL my data after the game just stopped working. I had a solid team and everything then the next day it just stopped letting me get past the title screen.
"Returning player. Just started about a week ago, and I am having great luck on these banners. One 4 üåü Lancer in Tutorial summon, four 4 üåü Sabers, one 5 üåü Caster, and one 4 üåü Ruler. Highly recommend to not only try this game, but also get a transfer ID and save it when you get a good start."
"The game offers way too little information on itself. Servant skills in the game dont give specific number values. An attack up skill would be looked at the same in every servant eventhough some have higher percentages. The rank of the skill (ex. A,B, or EX) dont always mean that the skill has high percentages. Weekly missions and event missions tell you to kill a specific enemy type but NEVER tell you the names that fit. It's a guessing game. I want to like the game but it's hard to."
fun fact: this game still has dead weeks even tho its 2 years behind its jp counterpart
i miss my house
"I've been playing this game for years and up until now the only way for me to actually move or play my account to another phone is to create a transfer code and password. Can you guys innovate and find other ways to make it so that if an event that i lost my phone and was not able to save a Picture of my transfer code to the cloud or saved it on another device i can still access it through other means? Cuz im afraid that if it does happen, I might not be able to retreive it."
THE GAME IS PURE COPIUM!!!!! JESUS CHRIST!!!!
"Artwork and va work is awesome, battle stuff is turn based which is fine, a bit laggy, not that much in terms of graphic, but holy heck the story is just amazing! Its probably 3/5 at best but fgo and just fate stuff overall will always be 5/5 in my heart"
Easily the dullest intro and tutorial to a game I've ever seen. Couldn't even finish it.
Superhell is coming.
"Great game, excellent storyline. 1-3 star servants can even compete with 4-5 star ones so you don't really need top-tier servants to clear the game. However the material farming is abysmal, stressful, time-consuming and simply terrible, especially for gold material and secret gems. It would be a much better game if the drop rate for material increases!"
I've gone and come back to this game 3 times previously just about to start my fourth time and I am starting to think that's for a reason every time this game has been on my mind the playthroughs from multiple youtubers has given me a sign that I should come back to this game wondering bout my first account but I'll inquire about it later.
Guacamole
"Fine for what it is. I wish it was on PC too. The graphics and art is pretty low resolution, and it's dumb that it's lagging behind the JP version."
Egg
great game but I gamble every thing I own
An update caused it to delete my profile/data from my phone. If I didn't have my transfer code and password on hand I would have been f'd.
"As far as Gacha Games go, this one is one of the most fair ones I play. Any character can be used at any point in the game as long as you either put effort into building them or plan hard fights accordingly. While the odds for 5 stars are rough, the game gives a good number of strong event servants and materials to where they aren't required to play through the game. Good story and worth playing if you wanna burn time and enjoy historical fiction."
"I'm totally fine on not working on keeping Zhuge Liang on the last anniversary event, totally fine."
Get lucky or get nothing at all
Gacha trash
Gas
"These days, the game is practically an update simulator. Cuz they keep updating it every GODDAMN DAY AT THIS POINT!!!"
"i hate this game, but i love Jeanne d'Arc so i give this 5 stars for Jeanne"
"Visual novel with a mandatory card game in the middle, but you have to pay to actually have the characters. The story is really good, but I found the gameplay to be sooooo boring. Also, this is one of the worst gacha rate games I've played. People save for a character for over a year, and still dont get them. Also, they finally added pity, but its so high it's like $1200 or something to reach it. Scam gacha, gameplay is about as interesting as stale whole grain bread. Just watch the show."
"The game is straight up a scam. This is worst then gambling, at least there you win every once in awhile."
My favourite game
"Decent if you know the series, and if you're a history buff anime fan. Not that what they present is factual at all, but they do keep the interactions between historical figures accurate. Consistent events, but some gated behind story progression. Can do it all with provided free units if rng doesn't favor you, don't pour money in as that's a slippery slope with their prices. Data doesn't transfer very well so be careful."
I really like the game but my problem is that every time I play it and get off of it go go to another app the game refuses to load and turns to a black screen so I have to re download it and start all the way back over
"I love this game but I always often exit the application myself, if possible, please give instructions so that I don't exit alone, thank you very much"
Pretty cool game I enjoy the characters and game play sincerely have a good day
Has Astolfo
It gives off a great vibe and it resemble the show
Like nasu
My pulls are phenomenal get reck
Grail Fronts are crashing my phone non stop because I wanted to take a break and now it's loading me back in and freezing everytime I try so I guess I gotta restart now
Excalibur...Morgan!!!
"It's good, also Mordred is best girl"
"It is a wonderful game that I enjoyed both on the battle system and on story. However, it is extremely frustrating to not have the account linked to your google account thus resulting in you having to get lucky or have great memory if you want a chance to get your account back should anything happen to the device you were using. Had I known that the data was not connected to your google account I would have saved the info elsewhere but I didn't and now I may never get my account back."
"Awesome game, came for the waifus stayed for the plot. And the waifus."
good story .. but garbage Quality of Life in game .. no auto and skip for farming wasting time instead of just log in do what need to be done then go back to other stuff in life that matters
Can i have a copy of Oberon pls
"Crashing issues have be resolved, probably due to the game being transferred over from dw servers"
Good game overall but it crashes and I can't play the events
A game that makes you comeback when you roll lucky in the gatcha but at the same time enjoy the story of the game which is now has an anime adaptation :) Edit 2023: Pity system is a joke
"I love murder. My genocide count is higher than Mao Zedong's, Stalin's, and Hitler's combined. Great game."
"Great f2p friendly game. Gacha rates are low, so don't expect to get everyone you want. However, game content can be cleared using low-star units and welfare units. We still need a pity though. Another thing, please improve the data backup system. Needing to re-issue a transfer code when switching devices is a hassle. Edit: freezing issue is so annoying and it's appalling that it still hasn't been fixed after so long."
"A wonderful and gripping RPG with a ton of great art and strategy involved, held back only by a money-sucking gacha mechanic."
Really enjoy the game but for some reason I've been getting an error where it doesn't progress past the start up screen. it just turns white when it should be logging me into my account
Future me: That's hell your walking into Me now: I know *slowly walks in*
I am addicted to gacha help
"The gacha Rate need to be better.. For a F2P like me, saving 600SQ and got no 5* is hurt AF.. Been playing this game since it was released, now i almost thinking about retiring"
Because illya is my favorite
I love cu
Give me Summer Kiara or else...........
"Rates could be better, but that's just standard gacha. The story is what's really on display here, and it reaches its full potential once the play makes it to the 2nd arc."
"Has kept me entertained for the many months I have played. Great story and lore, with interesting characters and great designs."
Best rgp game in type moon series
I enjoy the game however the amount of hand holding is enough to make me uninstall
Please fix the bug right now when I'm playing Grail front the game crashes even though my phone is not full storage
Everything is nice except for the gacha which is atrocious.
"Well, discovered my gambling addiction I didn't know I had"
"A great story locked behind months and years of mind-numbing grinding. Don't listen to the voices, you don't enjoy this. Don't let the tiny bursts of dopamine keep you going, they're lies in a sea of agony. It's too late for me, I'm never getting those years back... ooh look a new version of Rin!"
"I beat the first arc with a SSR who was one of the worst at the time and using only story support when possible. While being meta does help in some of the harder fights and with grinding, it is not necessary at all. Like all gatcha games, it's something of a ""lifestyle"" game and you'll often find yourself in a schedule to play it. The game notoriously lacks content however. Weeks can go by without any worthwhile events. I mention this because most of the stuff you want will come from events."
"game runs worse after every update, nigh unplayable now"
Fate for greatness
Astolfo :)
Pls fix the crashing and freezing
"Love the story and characters, but the rates are not great and wish we had a auto mode and farm and skip battle and summoning button, especially for those who are busy and/or multitask? Also Tamamo and the Apocrypha cast,FTW!"
"The game so far has been a lot of fun for me, but it may place many people off due to the amount of farming in it. Also there will be some times when a character's skill animation or Noble Phantasm lower frames or even freeze the game, however this was never frequent and only happened whenever I had bad Internet. Other than that the game's story has the same quality as any other from the Fate franchise even during events. The gameplay is unique for a turn based RPG and easy to understand."
Very fun game
"This game is incredible, I can't say more, but, there's the demeter, the worst enemy"
Great VA work and character designs. Story is slow to start but once it gets going its amazing. Been loving the game since I start.
"Literally the best story in any mobile game, if not visual novels in general."
Frick this game
Nice game‚ú®
Good game with good story and now it has pity
"Why is it that when you load this game it's just a black screen? Played for two hours , now I can't get it to load.... Guess I'll just stick to watching the anime üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Edited for this thought: reading the reviews it would appear that I am not the only one experiencing this bug ... Therefore if it's been a persistent bug with no fix from the devs than I would say this game is probably dead ... What a shame ."
I REALLY LOVE üòç THIS APP ! SINCERELY ALWAYS MR.DARRELL CLAY
Game forces you to reroll because you don't get a choice who to start with. Then it makes you use them.
"The fact that it's 2023 and this game has no way of linking accounts to some sort of Social Media/Google play is outright stupid. I had a lot of maxed out servants and even though I stopped playing for two years or so, I hate that all of my progress is now gone and in order to try and get it back, I have to remember information about an account I haven't touched in 2 years. Very brain dead."
"Came back after 2-ish years, transferred my data, and now I can't even get past the title screen."
"I have nothing more to say, than FGO is my favorite anime franchise"
"I've been playing this game on and off since it was released in the original Japenese. It's a great gacha game with a lot to do and learn and plenty of decent events to keep things interesting. Although they have been making changes recently that spells trouble for the servers. Crashes are regular, updates are a pain, and they don't seem to prioritize maintaining the app at all anymore"
Aniplex.inc How can optain the tranfer number i sent my user id
"Really love the franchise, been a fan of Fate series but just picked fgo game, i would give it 5stars if only we could link the game to google acc."
"Good story, matches players progression well so you are not leveling up for long periods of time before moving on. Almost non existent ads."
BOOBA
"Event stories are always fun and enjoyable. Main stories have so many moments that make you go ""wow!....."" or ""this character, this character is one of my favorites now"". Rates are meh..... but if you plan ahead(check JP schedule) it becomes very doable to get a character you like or want. Main story is clearable with just lower rarity units so it's very F2P friendly, just be ready to grind a bit."
"After recent update, game became very laggy. Cant enjoy the event at all. *Edit: After the new patch the lagging issue were solved, but somehow the game crash sometimes. Never had this issue before, hope it will be fixed too *Edit2: looks like the crashing issue were caused by my old device, game is fine with other device."
"One of the most friendly to f2p gatcha games out there. While it doesnt have a reasonable pity draw system, it makes up for it with plenty of free SQ. The art is great, the story is fantastic, and the events are fun as well. Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed."
I'm playing on a moto g stylus 5G and I haven't had any crashes or real lag. I used to on my previous device but after getting my current one it works like a dream. Overall I love this game's story and gameplay. It got me into the fate series and even got me to cry sometimes. I truly thank my past self for downloading this beautiful game.
Me spend the cash I get dopamine perfect
Very recommended!
Fate is fate
"Everyone, please stop giving the game negative reviews because of the frequent crashes. The latest versions of Android is behind all this so please hang tight for a fix in a later update."
"Best Turn base game here in mobile, the story is engaging, the difficulty has thrills in it and you will really appreciate it if you are a fan of Fate series"
Playing king hassan and cursed arm and hundred face and fate xiang yu i am very happy to get fate xiang yu because i no have any of the lostbelt serevant thanks and happy to bond with fate xiang yu i have been bond with cursed arm hassan and king hassan aka old man of the mountains bond together hope to bond with Fate xiang yu
"after the recent update, the game crashes almost once per stage. ive literally never had this issue before"
This has been a great game to me tbh I love the story and characters alot more then I thought I would tho I would like for it to atleast fix it's bug of it crashing and hanging if you could do that this game would get a 5 star rating
Good but the drop rates are...
Can you make this app fullscreen on my red magic 6r? Edit: thanks devs.
"Would be better if you could anchor your account, otherwise i like the game a lot."
"Honestly I still don't get why I play this game, I want to keep playing. I've invested more in other games but this is the only game I'm still playing."
Gray best saberface
Best game. Worst gacha üëåüëåüëå
Tradh game
Needs more Tamamo Cat.
This company is making millions of dollars and yet they refuse to implement any sort of quality of life. Not to mention they don't have any proper backup system other than that outdated transfer code. It seems to me this company doesn't care about it's players or respect our time.
The worst free to play ever. The American server is 2years behind jap!! Has the lowest rates ever and when you pull for units you can get completely useless equipment instead of actual characters. Horrible translation and no auto play system. Super stingy game I don't know they are one of the top earners still with a horribly dated system. Do not support this go play something else.
"The gacha rate is one the worst for gacha games. Even with the pity system, things can go really bad at times. Events also have RNG, leaving you out of getting the 5th copy of CE to MLB it. The game could be great but competition has greatly surpassed FGO in terms of gacha rates e.g. Genshin where players are more willing to open their wallets."
"I can deal with the constant ads but I cannot deal with that horrible music that accompanies them. If I could, I would give -1 star for every time I've had to hear it."
"Hi, I have trouble, my game is freezed in black screen after I click into the application after I try to restart a few times. And when I try to delete and reinstall the app, all of my data and progress in this app are gone. Pls help fix this issue. Thanks"
"Gotta be honest, I love this game. But recently I can't even get on like a lot of others. It says it can't connect to the server."
"Really fun, the character rates are a bit low especially for 5 stars"
The game shuts down every time I try to log in.
Hi developers! the game is pretty fun and great but i have problems regarding optimization of the game for my phone. My phone is above the minimum requirements but it still sometimes freezes the screen for 10 seconds or so and then sometimes a lot of frame drops even in low resolution mode. I am hoping they optimize the game for new devices!
I have a lot of fun playing this game but I think it's time to let go for now until next time fgo
Rating this game one star because there is no options to bind the game to email or fb would be more safer way to keep account data safe and not lose progress if they allow it
One of the best games I've ever played Story well written And characters from different cultures And mythology Absolutely amazing
GACHA!!
"I played fgo for four years. Spent money every now and then. A few days ago I got a error saying my account was transfered. After a back and forth with customer service. Provided receipts from 2018 to 2021 of paid quartz and a bunch of personal info, they say because my account is active They can't help me. I never shared my transfer code with anyone. I have no idea how someone got my account transfer but I cannot recommend this game due to the security. 4 years gone."
"Came back, story absolutely carrying rn, gacha is still bad, but every gacha is too"
"Great game but it keeps crashing and I cant get past lostbelt 2 because of the constant crashing. Please fix the game, I really enjoy it."
"My experience for now has been very good,Good graphics,easy control battle system and interesting heroes,enjoy"
Cannot connect to server :( Keep getting this error and everything Itried hasnt worked. I'm missing out on the special event!
Imagine Saber Astolfo. Haha just kidding.... Unless...?
"Like others have said, recently I've tried to play the game but it won't load! I tried clearing my cache, restarting my phone, etc. But it just remains in a black loading screen. Please fix!"
Unfortunately within the last few days this game has stopped working on Wi-Fi and today won't even load off of my mobile data so I may end up losing all my login bonuses because of this.
best mobile game i have ever seen
Will we get draco queen?
I am using a REVVL 6 Pro and For some reason after initially downloading the game the first time I will play it it runs perfectly fine and puts me at the tutorial. However after going through the tutorial or closing the app and then reopening it I will get nothing but a blank screen.
I like the history the game
I don't get astolfo :(
I love the game play and lore when the game works. Has frequent crashes and as of the recent update I can no longer Play the game with wifi just cell service and my service is bad
I know this games fine and the gameplay and story is interesting but there are major problems like saving accounts and the game not connecting properly it keeps saying not connected to server even thou my wifi is fine this game just has to many bugs and problems that needs to be fixed
catch up to jp and dont replicate their dead weeks/months please
Really appreciate
GATCHA?! GATCHA?... GATCHA!
Fate
Been playing since the game came out and it is still a really fun game
for the development please fix the crash when you klik icon to summon the banner van gogh i want to roll van gogh
Favorite gatcha game. Gameplay is actually engaging too.
Don't play unless you have money!
"One of the worst in terms of rolling in gacha. Is the lowest ssr rates that I know of. Even rate ups are a crapshoot cuz they share the pool w/ the generic pool, it's a high chance of not getting what you want unless you pity. Pity is only once, if you pity or get the rate up once, it's gone for that banner forever. It doesn't carry over. EN FGO's only upside is that it's permanently 2 years behind JP, allowing you to plan ahead. It takes almost a year to get pity for f2p. It's a whale's game."
"Would give it 5 stars, because I've loved and played for years. But over the past two days, it won't even start, no matter how many times I clear the cache. It claims I don't have good connection, but my internet is fine."
"Inactive email support! I have emailed so many times, following up for updates but still no reply!"
Yea it's good keep it up
It's a good game!
I did like the game but having to reinstall every time there's an update is getting old not restarting again wish I could give 0 stars
I can't load the game recently for the past few days. It is stuck in the black loading screen. I tried pressing no and then yes on the clear cache in different attempts but I still can't open it. I also tried waiting for 5 minutes but it won't open. I also tried restarting my phone and the Wi-Fi but it didn't work. My app is also at the latest version. And lastly I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but it didn't work! What is going on?! Please fix it. I am playing in Vivo Y22s.
Please fix this error
Thanks for the 5 stars
Fate Go is prolly the must play among fate heads and also one of the longest running gacha. Also rate up is s lie
the ONLY gatcha game we need ~ none of that fake communist stuff ~
"You could beat the game perfectly without a single SSR, until the Lostbelts. The difficulty spike is pretty big and if you don't have a five star with the required skill set or someone who could tank hits, you're done for. Rates are bad, so you could already imagine how much of a pain it'll be. I was one of the lucky F2P to get quite the amount of SSRs, but no support servants. Yeah, if you missed out/don't have Castoria, Waver, Tamamo, Skadi, or Merlin, good luck on lostbelts. Le epic wack RNG"
FGO.
"Got Astolfo :D. The game crashes sometimes. It also have audio issues, freezes or lags."
"Been playing since launch, but lately there has been a lot of bugs. Its been unplayable. Edit: I installed web privew and works well now."
Fun but the drop rates are abysmal
Great game but sometimes it lacks content and dookie summons
Doesn't crash all the time now.
Great game!
"That's hell you're walking into. I don't recommend this game to anyone, especially if they have self control issues around micro transactions. The rates for SSR are a joke, if you want an specific character be ready to dump cash into this. The good thing is that the free to play and low rarities are very useful."
"Overall amazing Just don't like the Saint quarts issue, pretty sure not the issue but also chances to get servants are pretty damn low, atleast for me"
"I just honestly, have nothing to complain"
"I have been playing this game ever since it was released in America and love the franchise. The game had rarely had issues and minimal crashes when starting to play, but that changed with the recent updates. The game has frozen or crashed more times than I can count, and during an event no less, which is making it nearly unplayable. All of my friends also play this game and have seen the same issues too. On top of this, draw rates are still incredibly low compared to other gacha games I play..."
Please make an enhanced version with 3d models and account transfers
"The game is wonderful, in my opinion, but the only issue i seem to have is when I try to buy saint quartz, when I try to buy some, it says it can't go through. And from their I decided to turn to different methods to buy it, like gift cards but at last I'm at a loss."
"The game was generally good, good graphics, nice voice actor per character, also great character design. I'm just having issues with the petty system that just been implemented."
"What do i expect on Gameplay? Too outdated, But story is High tier, Not Bad but well Written. And i stay for my Waifus. gAcha is Hell and this game is the proof"
"The quality and the special affects for the skills are just amazing, same as the story u- guys put it together so perfectly"
Amazing Story and amazing characters that's all I have got to say
believe me i play this game because of doujins
"Allo!?? After recent update (Van Gogh event), my game always crashed right after I click button to Summoning pool. Fix please. EDIT: Giving 5 again"
I love this game good story but too hard to get ssr servant and ce save is the key to get good ssr. I recommend to pull support servants because any character are good if they have a good support. Thats all good luck on summon and enjoy the story.
rate up is a lie
"I enjoyed playing this game since it's easy to understand, it has good music and story, and they give many rewards. However, I didn't got the ssr I want so yeah, only 4 star. You better give me Castoria next time."
I like it Pisacco
It's pretty fun and has a great story. The gacha aspects aren't to unforgiving either
Story is great for me... The game has highs and lows but it never fails to excite me üôÇ
The game are good the story also but gacha drop rate is little bit brutal but it still a good game keep developing:))
a beautiful story about history... take it with a grain of salt.
3 stars because it's missing a dozen QoL features other games have. Add skip options for quests already! Not everyone is jobless. And stupidly expensive prices. Fk off with 86$ for 150 gems. Especially when your rates are the most infamous in the gacha market.
Excellent to ruin your live
ai seiba
"I love This game everything is good The gacha is quite fun too the issue is already Fixed By the devs Great service love this game, best gacha And graphics are good super easy to understand and it features Fgo Characters THE MANAGEMENT TEAM ARE VERRY CHAD ON HANDLING LOST ACCOUNTS SOO ITS VERRY CONVENIENT TAKING THEM BACK"
This game helped me understand fate when i wanted to enjoy it. I have played this game since december 2021 and have enjoyed it. Even though it has had it's up's and downs.
Devil May cry Fate you have to be careful
People got sum mad skill issue with fgo
Inconvenient login system
stuttering as hell. You guys MUST fix this
I can't even play the game anymore the game crashes too much that was never a problem before
Bait banners suck
"More like Fate/Craft Essence order. Not counting guaranteed banner for New years, not a single SSR from any of the pulls in the past year. This is getting ridiculous. You should be ashamed of your drop rates."
"this game is beautiful, the graphics are wonderful and it has many more stories and it has a voice and there are many more stories even though my internet is weak it is still smooth it is really good I wish it had many servants and thank you again for this game because it had Android I'm really happy thanks"
Trying to get ahold of support lost my account i have user id and proof of purchase why am i getting new answere
"4 outta 5 The stories are getting better (some are freakin amazing), music & ost are phenomenal as usual. Only problem still remains is how cruel the gacha system is (even with pity at 900credits - which is a lot)"
Can't get in
No pity system
"I haven't written a review in a long time! Why has this game not got a 5* review, loving everything about this game, what a find, thank you!"
"Nice game tbh, I'm liking the ff's made referencing the game, and playing this game gives me insight at how should I make a ff too"
It's a great game just wish it was easier to get the Saint stone thingys lol
Hackers Material ..
I spent all my lifes money trying to get a JPEG üòî
"Game definitely much better than what it was years ago. The grind however is still there. Better, but still tedious. It's the only reason I didn't gave it a 5 star."
Have a few leggy problems and the game freeze but besides good game
"My game stopped working. As soon as i start up the game, it shows the usual white logo screen for a few seconds but then turns completely black with nothing happening afterwords. The usual small touch patterns appear when i touch the screen but nothing else. Please help as i dont know how to get account back?!"
"Pity system needs some work, but it's an improvement, events are still to time consuming, and I've been losing my will to play. Otherwise a solid game."
Ciwcymbr
"Ever tried playing a game with electronics off? Same experience. I have been playing this game for 6 years now and starting in October of 22 the game has lag, crashes constantly, won't load past the loading screen, or will black screen. I emailed support to ask about any fixes as none were working that were recommended. I was then emailed back saying they would look into it and an update later its fixed. Then the very next update it's back to it's same problems. Update: New patch still not fixed"
"Man, I love this game"
sad because i can't use my same account that i put a lot of work into on my new phone
the rates are absolute GARBAGE. The rates are bloated with craft essences while the ACTUAL GODDAMN SERVANTS are the hard to gets. ugh. and the grinding...why is there no auto features? the story is addicting but nah...just go watch it on youtube and play a better game.
this game made me mentally unstable ong
"I give you 5 stars, you give me Van Gogh ( no van Gogh)"
Gun
It's Been a Year when I Started to This Game But Sadly I Need to Let Go‚Ä¶ It's Been Fun‚Ä¶ ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I saved up to 500SQ and still didn't get a single 5*. Uninstalled the game. Story is too long and only for just 3SQ. NOT WORTH IT!!!
I tried opening today but the game keeps telling me i failed to connect over and over Even though I have strong internet pls help
"Never paid for anything, still I have a lot of my favorite 5* servants, I am playing since launch in NA"
No longer wants to upate and won't let me play. Wasted to much time
"All in all, it's a good game, but there's a problem with the damage counter. After the np is finished, it disappears too quickly, so idk how big the total damage."
The gacha is merciful to me
I'm changing my review cause it was super fun no issues.. Since the recent update the app refuses to load keeps saying application didn't launch properly
Unhealthy. Will not recommend
"Horrible rates. You can't expect anything, even after spending large amounts. Literally better off playing almost any other gacha."
Hello lasengle why I can't transfer my data?
It's literally unplayable. It keeps saying that it can't connect to the server. It's very disappointing since I spent money on the game and would still very much like to play the game. Hope it gets fix soon. Edit: the app is working again but it will probably be a problem again.
I beat this game. Good game.
Download game to find out there is more to download so can't play game y do that y can u just show how much there is to download. Had to give it one star to post
I've been playing this game since 2017 and all I can say is I still love it.
"I love the characters in this game, their personality shines, the art is great, and the story has me invested. However the game is so boring and such a grind fest. Gameplay is basically a matching card game and you get basically nothing for completing quests. Summon rates are abyssmal, for refrence Fire Emblem Heroes has an average of 8% for a 5 star and 3% for a focus. The loading times are really long too. This game is super pay to win and its only getting by necause of Fate fans and simps"
"sucks,very bad game play"
No neco arc in sight.
worst drop rates on playstore.
Love the game a lot but now it's kicks me out every time I use Gilgamesh (Archer)
The game did not load and now all my data is gone
If this didn't require so much bandwidth that it crashes when ever u try to do anything i wouldn't be giving it a -5star but u cant give that so have to give 1 star but please fix been trying the same level multiple times manage to do 1 attack out of 3 then it stops responding as it requires a 100% perfect imternet signal with absolutely no lag or drops whatsoever unless u have that this game just can't be played which makes this game suitable for a console but not a fone fullstop until u fix it
"I've always loved FATE for it's giving history a modern personality while keeping the facts correct; this game puts you in the master seat of a whole new journey. If you're f2p like myself, the grind is slow but rewarding. It took me over a year to get a 5* from each class, and the gacha rates are unforgiving, but the gameplay is amazing and the story is as well."
This game has caused me financial issues more than once. 10/10 would spend at least another ¬£100
genshin players be hating
Fun fact not related to the game:the character in the logo of the game it's the exact same character from Alice in sword art online
Crashing issue seems to be fixed and they've been doing a lot of good stuff with NA. Goated game
Pls fix the game. After the update I can't summon servants. When I press the summon button it will crash pls fix it immediately üò≠üò≠ (Update 17 march 2023 7:04PM) Game still not working in my phone
"Good game, good story, bad gacha"
ps4 and xbox series
"Game is great, but it feels stagnant after awhile. It is fun for me but it's not for everyone."
Great story great game.
Best F2P ever! The only mobile game worth my time. Gatcha sucks but oh well.
Game!
"Overall good now, occasional issues with logging in but mostly back to the amazing game that I initially started playing."
"Been an old player before , and after coming back to the game with a new account. My experience so far has been engaging, so many things have changed with how many years have passed. The game has became beginner friendly with helping new players level up their units and rewards them well that you won't notice that you're hooked on the game."
"It took my money, beat me with it, and then runs away telling me it will do it again."
"Make other payment option like buying saints quartz from your offical website, make it Global not restrict to NA. Lower the pity system"
My phone's almost to the point where it can't support this game anymore. Can't buy a new one because I'm broke. Thanks for the years.
A good rpg game that has a great story and funny but good events :3
Won't let me update
"Ngl, this might be the best gacha game I've ever played. Im not really a fan of the servants' drop rates but the main story is very well written. I love fgo so much! And the devs really cares about their players because they give us a fair amount of rewards every time we login. I hope for more things to come and thank you fgo!"
Only mobile game I play. Very reasonably balanced and rewards sticking with it. Constantly hosting events and regularly adding major expansions.
Free to play. Lmao. 10/10
No hiatus. Arthur came home. :)
Incredible
Amazing storyline and well developed characters
Great story! Fun battle system. You definitely have to try it. My favorite game by far!
I love gambling for another saber face
"My wife made fun of me constantly for playing this game. Now she has 3 waifus and is furiously rolling for Saber Alter. In all seriousness though, it's an amazing mobile RPG with great writing and gameplay. Pacing can be a little weird due to the gacha nature of summons and events can come at you at a breakneck speed, but there's a good reason millions play this game. Every quartz you earn is a satisfying reward."
me likey woman very fun game
App version error but no option to update appears. Amazing work on taking care of your game.
Beautiful Game <3
"Well to keep it short, Fate Grand Order is overall a good game no more no less. Yes, it does tend to get boring because of all the grinding, yes the gacha system is annoying even more so if you're a free to play. Other than that controls are simple, game style and graphics are good and storytelling is interesting from time to time."
Fun game but too pricey
Really solid Gacha game that actually feels like it has okay rates. A lot of the lower star characters are actually useful and can be used in strategic ways. Only reason why I put 4 and not 5 stars is the pity is crazy high especially because pity doesn't carry over like most gacha games now.
As a new player and long time time fan of the series I have to say I spent more time on this gotcha game then I would like to admit but there's good reason the story is amazing and they have done a great job at giving even lesser know heroic spirits some time in the sun and unlike other games of a similar nature you can beat the games story with low rarity units you don't have to priorities high rarity ones so if there is a low rarity character you love you can take them into the end

"Something is going wrong with the game. When I try and Enhance some of my Servants they're registering as Lancer class when they're not. Archer EMIYA, Saber Fergus mac Roi, Rider Boudica, to name a few. Is it just mine or is this happening everywhere? Edit: Nevermind, turns out I had the filter on. Sorry."
Trash game still using codes. Can't even reply to my account recovery email.
"Haven't been playing long but it's pretty immersive with the story telling of the singularities. I have noticed that it will freeze during story progression, battles and navigating menus."
"It became unplayable now for me as I find it so rather tedious to get my account back and all my progress are now gone. Even costumer service from your email sucks at doing transfer code job now. Like they rather declined me taking back my account back just because I keep reinstalling this game because of your game's crashes. MY CONNECTION AND INTERNET IS GOOD. YOUR GAME SUCKS NOW. NO ACCOUNT BINDING OR LOGIN CREDENTIALS SAVED. LIKE SERIOUSLY, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE GAME DATA LOSSES. TCH."
I hope in this summer. summer camp event will be back. I really want back yu mei ren
"Really great story and pretty decent gameplay. Of course the monetisation is scummy, but you can complete basically everything without having to pay a dime. It's less p2w and more pay to get chance of getting waifu, as with most popular gacha games. Overall, I don't really care for rolling anyways, and the story is what drew me in. The earlier singularities are sort of boring sotrywise, but camelot and after were really great imo."
Would love it if more old republic characters were available...darth bane and tarre visla just to name a couple
Login bonus on events cut you off from future rewards if you miss one day. Stingy. Repetitive ads
Tamamo cat very sex
If you're a fan of the Fate series this is a must try
I been playing this over one year now but but somehow this update it become lagged you can't even play it properly. I hope you fixe it soon I want to play it again
"It's a very good game in terms of fights, voice lines, animation etc... But I wish if they add multiplayer to this game like (arena) or something like that"
Can not login... Stuck on the loading screen and game refuses to run. Has been like this for the past 2 weeks.
It's fun but a level 10 enemy is doing a lot of damage to my level 50. Makes no sense.
"Rich story and impressive set of characters. Great variety of illustrators and VAs. NA team pushing QoL updates earlier is a huge plus. However, lack of reasonable pity and recent frequent crashes are a minus though."
"great story and character designs, boring gameplay"
I really enjoy this game but it would make it more enjoyable if you'd start doing collaberation events and implement an auto battle feature but other than that i really like the gameplay & it would make it easier if we could use our social accounts to keep our progress instead of having to make a transfer code & password to keep our progress but other than that it's a great game to play keep up the great work
Hard
Going to start playing this game i hope its good
Why did i even this pee?can't ever remember playing this dish
"Nothing wrong mechanically with the game, other than absolutely garbage dumpster Fire drop rates for heroes, I'm tired of getting the same CE 4x in a 11 drop roll and having half of my drops wasted after brain numbingly grinding for the stupid saints quartz"
"It's been years and they didn't bother to add that one line of code that prevents the screen from locking itself. There have been some improvements, but in this last event there's a never-ending video and I cannot play the game."

"If your screen turns black and / or game keeps crashing, you need to fix your web system view."
"There is so much wrong with this version of FGO: inaccurate or entirely missing translations, and censorship of dialogue and art (servant and story lines, Emiya Alter). There are so many instances of the ""translators"" inserting whatever they want instead of a correct translation. This all happens so often, it honestly shouldn't be considered FGO (English), but FGO (Reddit), especially since that is the only place they look at"
"Literal skinner box game. Everything in the game encourages you to put in way more than you get out. And with such abysmal rates for literally any character, with NO PITY SYSTEM, you are hard pressed to be able to get who you want. Not to mention the gameplay sucks as well, with none of the conveniences that other gacha's provide leaving it clunky and a huge time waste. The story is the only saving grace, but you can watch it on youtube. Play a better game like Blue Archive or Genshin Impact."
"I needed help in recovering my account. I asked fgo support to see if they can help me recover it. They asked me questions pertaining to my account. I told them my answers as best as I could remember. I also showed them my most recent receipt that I bought saint quartz with. A day later, they replied that they could not recover my account due to insufficient and accurate data that I replied with. I have spent four years and over 3k in this game. Waste of time and effort. Never coming back ever."
"Its good despite lag and crash on low budget phones, still worth it"
Excellent game. Very entertaining
i love fgo
used to be a great game but the super rare chance of draw 5star even 4star servant and lack of new game elements has letting lots of old player decided to quit this game.
"Everything about the game is wonderful, the graphics, the story and the characters are very well made"
"I highly agree with the 3* rating. The game's story is very interesting and unique. The summons are brutal unless you pay for saints quarts. As a free to play player, I have some 4* and a few 5* servants. This game would do well to get rid of the craft essences in the summon pool as I've had countless times gotten 4 and 5* essences that very well could have been servants. I highly dislike this aspect of the game, especially since gaining enough to do a 10 times summon is hard enough as is."
BEST GAME EVER 10/10
I hate this game.
"I tried to play this game when it was first launched but wasn't able to. But here are my takes now that I experienced it. PROS: unique turn based rpg with action cards, Type-Moon characters to collect in gacha & easy to play. CONS: for a game released in 2018 the illustration & new content looks fine; but the GUI & graphics it didn't aged well. Even the characters are in 2D puppet animation w/out shading & shadow. Overall, I like the Fate series & I had fun playing, but it's just feels old."
The Game Was Not Great It's Says NO CONNECTION BUT I HAVE A STABLE CONNECTION
Mindless grindy gameplay
"Microtransactions are the only way to get anything good in this game either that or you can sit and grind for extremely long hours, get 600 sq, and then maybe with extraordinary luck you might get a good character"
Trash
"Constant Crashing ""Game Server is Lost (restart) or (retry)"" is a constant thing in events. Clearing Cache and Reinstalling doesn't work. Only changing timezones work. Thankfully, Support is fast to help though"
I've played this game for about 5 minutes and it already doesn't work. Even when it was working it froze every 30 seconds. All in all game would be better if you could actually play it.
"The gameplay, story, and characters are fine.The problem comes from the criminals gacha rates that are so bad that some players have used thousands for one copy of a character with nothing showing up. Areas of the gameplay and story anlre also lacking and outdated as well. The more recent issue is that the game with always crash. Unless you have a really modern phone this game will be slow and crash a lot. I only recommend this game to people with good impulse control and a modern 2019-23 phone."
"I have a complaint,the game has been great so far,but i have recently noticed that 3 of the Servants i got from the gacha (Shakespere, Hassan of the Cursed Arm and Caligula) have suddenly dissapeared from my Servant roster. And im pretty sure i didnt accidentally sell them in the shop section."
If you love the franchise you will like playing this one. But beware that its an 2015 gacha game and even your love can be questioned.
"Summons have become horribly unbalanced. 160+ summons got one 4 star servant. Having a pity system kick in after 350 draws, no thank you. This paying customer is checking out."
Great game great story and great characters with lovely events
The game starts off quite slow. However as you progress through the games story you realize that at a point it goes from stupid easy to crazy hard making you plan and use any units you can to pass level after level. The waifus they put out are top tier and seem to be quite unique. The combat system has grown on my quite a bit compared to when I started and didn't understand how it was playable. The game is verry deep and stands the tests of time.
"Game is broken. Tells me app didn't launch properly I've cleared casch cookies, reinstalled game and same thing. Even tried a different internet connection and nothing works. Smh"
This game is literally broken right now. I can't even log on due to server issues.
gambling addiction
"I'd give it a zero if I could for the complete trash that is it's account system. I had to redownload the game and ended up losing everything. Good going lasengle, 2023 and you guys can't figure out a way we can link an account to the google play store we use to BUY the stuff in the game. Well done"
I can't log in üò≠
Idk WHAT happened but thd game doesn't even load anymore. Tried everything nothing works. I get up to the starting screen but after it freezes on a white screen then crashes and boots me out. Use to run just fine now I can't even play it.
"Perfect game. My complaint is that if you ever have to stop playing it you have to get a new transfer number (i didn't notice this and lost everything, to my knowlege)"
It's aight
"I can't get on the game at all. It keeps saying retry or restart. No matter how many times I try, even clearing cache, still won't load letting me in. Twice this issue has happened. October and now this month. Please fix this"
Actual gacha game which is perfect in every aspect
the pity system is obscene and game is very stingy w/summoning stones
Phone died unexpectedly tried to get my account back and their email support system is a joke been playing since 2017 sad to see it go but oh well guess ill just have to live with it.
"Saving the world with history's greatest heroes, half of which are cute anime girls. That's what they call peak fiction. The gacha rates are terrible but nothing else is monetized so what else could you expect?"
Fate is fate it's going to be goated!
Nothing is sacred anymore.
There is unfortunately a lot of white washing of characters
This game requires online features to play let's you play with characters around the world signor killer jack the ripper and riches woman ever lived cleopatra and her greatest spy ever life differently going get assassin ever sever England started year 2004 hol grail war still be held video games predict the future game theory channel we got reported from the government holy grail war still be held Lady ather need our assistance lancelot still available our world cleopatra and jack the ripper
Gacha.
"Yet these hands, will never hold anything..."
It's a fun game but I have a black screen and can't get into the game
"Horrible. After 1 game update the game refuses to even start, ive cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled and it still doesnt work. UPDATE: ALL OF MY PROGRESS HAS BEEN ERASED!!!! Unbelievable. If i could half a star i would. As a newer player to have what good stuff ive gotten taken from me and have to start over is no good. All because of a start up bug. 1 star but from me personally...only Half a star until i get some sort of compensation"
"It would be better if it were even a 1% more chance to get a 5star servant, it's damn near impossible, I've only ever had 2 over the multiple accounts, I even made multiple accounts in the same event period that gave out large amounts of quarts which is the premium currency and still only got one 5 star per account, I don't like the idea of having to purchase stuff to get better, it erases the ideology of earning anything, therefore there is no point to spend any sort of time doing anything."
"It's a gacha with pretty basic controls, 2d waifus and husbandos and a decent enough turn based combat. But I'm biased so I rate 4/5 for fate. Not amazing but saiba"
I absolutely love fate zero and I think this game does the anime justice! I highly recommend checking this game out you won't be disappointed.
"Painful, I am in immense debt and still don't have a SSR Rider 10/10 Edit: I actually do have a SSR Rider now, all I need now is a SSR Caster"
"Since I have been playing this game for more than 3 years, this game is really for people of big spenders to be able to get what they want as the chances are too low and the new pity syatem is not free player friendly. Ihave played several games with pity syatems but this game is far worst or the most worst. The pricing of ita in app game currency is too expensive compared to other game which I played. For 3 dollars you can do one summon as to others you can do several summons with those curency"
Widescreen disappears when using gesture mode on realme 8i.
"Good game, i like the fate franchise so getting my favourtie characters in a game is really nice. Sure the characters are herd to get, but if you save up enough and get the character you want, its much more rewarding. Also this game is one of the most balanced games I have played. 3 star servants can clear most of this games content if you use the right strategy."
Exceptional. The price for in-game currency is overpriced.
Oh they added pity that's sweet! Oh you have to spend 950 quartz ($480) to hit it......why even put a pity in
Got a new device game runs fine now
I love this game but the new update has made it noticably much more slower and crashes far more frequently. I can't even log on without it crashing now.
"lost a year of game play, sad the devs, can screw it up soo bad, refund my 11.99 google, you ripped me off,,, looks like i lost 3 years of play, dont waste your time, grrrr"
One of the most irritating yet entertaining things I've experienced
"Great story, I have to knock a star off for the reptitive gameplay, and also the constant crashes."
"I am not expert in leaving reviews but here is what I think The game is good, the story is pretty amazing too. So far, it is going great. I also love the graphics and gameplay. I just wish that you all would consider changing Tezcatlipoca's design a little bit because it has been a circus this whole time. To be honest, his whole personality and his insights are what made me like him but his art is just.."
Good but it's long to get good characters
I genuinely love this game.
"Nice Game Wonderful gameplay and story , I play this everyday and every update and new story is wonderful keep it up guys . Just a little edit, please fix some bugs, when i play the game its really good but when i was going to summon and pick a friend servant some how it stuck but i can hear the game sound ok but not the screen. Thanks"
Been playing for years. Gems are expensive. Story is out there but well done.
Fantastic story and great character designs.
I want to play an fog like in arcade pls make that
"Very enjoyable, it's a great game for those interested in the fate franchise, mythology or history and the storytelling is some of the best I've ever seen. I'd highly recommend giving this game a go provided you can spare the memory on your phone"
bad gacha rates
One of my best games I've ever played! I love FGO so much!!!
At first I thought it was a boring game but after I played it I realized it was an interesting game so I keep playing it and I'm kinda addicted.
Excellent game! I have been playing for over a year and I generally found my experience playing Fate/GO to be pretty positive. Truly a masterpiece!
suck no ssr
"Love the game, love the story, love the mechanics. Don't love the 2 year delay between the Japanese and Global versions."
Good combination of 3d and 2d animations and camrea are smooth there's still great femboys but improve the drop rates of some of those femboys I swear u never get em like astolfo or any other ones tbh I'm just here for them girl boys
Amazing as always only complaint is lag
Gacha hell
"Recently stopped working at all on a Moto G6. Game itself is decent when it does work, but the old school JRPG feels quite dated. Probably going to either take a break or quit entirely because Genshin Impact is just so much better. Gacha monetization is also quite predatory but also completely unnecessary for playing the game all the way through."
This my drugs and l'm still doing it
"I would like to give it a more meaningful review, but it simply does not run in my Moto Z2. Instead of all these illustrations, I only saw a blank screen. I tried it in a Galaxy S20. It worked, but it is essentially Fate Grand loading and Fate Grand dialog. The long loading time and the extencive dialog made the mandatory tutorial even more annoying."
I hate this game üíïüíïüíï‚ú®
I LOVE ASTOLFO AND MINAMOTO NO RAIKOU THEY ARE MY DADDY AND MOMMY RESPECTIVELY GOD BLESS
"This game hasthe worst gacha. I used to spend money, but the game gave me literally nothing for my money. The devs are dishonest and I honestly believe the rates are rigged. If you play, do so as F2P as they will take your money and give you nothing! Lasengle provides zero content and thevgrail front is poorly designed trash! They proved in JP that they will never appropriately end the game!"
"I like it, it is very entertaining, and I finally got the ones I wanted"
"Absolutely stupid account system that does not have login options or bind to you in any way, and account recovery is difficult even if you have proof that a lost account is yours. Gacha system is also unfavorable."
Wow it's so amezingüòäüòä
"2/10/23 back again and what a surprise the update of today didn't do ish and still crashes on the menu screen at this point I might as well uninstall the game, pls fix thank you üòûüòûüòûüòû and even when I go to the summon menu it crashes the whole game, at this point pls add a cross saved with Facebook or Google because I just want to uninstall it at this point"
"This will ruin you, and you'll never recover financially. But the Collection deserve sacrifice. 10/5 would ruin second life for 5 stars."
"Game crashes somewhat often (I have a Note 4, idk if it's a phone or app issue but until low res/60fps settings were added it was very stable.) Other than that it's a great game with an awesome story, definitely worth trying."
Unfunctional trash no longer opens. Take this waste of a game off the market and stop embarrassing yourselves.
As of someone that has played it for four years. I have had a great experience with Fate/go. I wish I could continue. But my android can't take anymore storage for the constant patches for the game. I really wish that there would be a version on the Switch or a version of it being lite on the data.
i've been playing this game for five years. cheers
"top tier story, but not a fan of the gameplay. ill just stick to the anime then."
This is a rate
"I really enjoy this game, but it honestly needs an auto system. I can't keep manually fighting every scenario and stage. I wannt press auto and let it do its thing. Please consider auto battle."
"Sadly the game is nice but the fact that they force you to use hereos of other people is boring af, and ruins the whole experience of getting there yourself. You legit are forced to use 5 star hereos that are max lvl that 1 shot everything. And the worst part is people say ""just put them in the back and dont use them..... It defeats the whole purpose of playing a gacha if I am only going to use 2 hereos when the game allows me to use 3... Potential is there but execution is poor."
Lo que pudieras pedir y mas.
They fixed the crashes and now it's completely playable. Love the story and animation update
Cant login. Just white screen after the title page
I wish they seperate banners for servant and CE
"love the game, hate the gacha"
"The rates of the gacha are abysmal in general, the gameplay is dated and playing on lower end phones is VERY ROUGH with newer units, and old events never get rerun, making some early free units unavailable for new players (and will get worse in the future in regards to reruns). This game should not be your introduction into the fate franchise. The characters are incredibly writen, and the story (for the most part) is brilliant and PEAK FICTION in some chapters."
I hate life
This game has an interesting story and characters are ü§åü§åü§å
"Honestly the game is amazing,it's got a unique battling style great characters and a godly storyline,it might be hard to get into because of the first 5 singularities but everything after that is fully worth the wait"
Mwa
nice updates üòä
Gimme lots of SSR!!!!?
"Well I had a white screen display after updating. It happened on my 3 accounts though it works well on BlueStacks . Problem is I didn't have the time to get the transfer numbers. I tried different methods like reinstalling (when I still had my transfer numbers), changing settings to US language, cache clear, and restarting my phone. Sadly none worked and I'm afraid of losing my 2 year progress. Damn sorry fgo, but without a patch 2 stars is all I can give right now."
This game has lots of stuff to do which is nice and they keep adding more and more! My only complaint is that in your summon pools for servants it is very rare to get one. I've had to go through hundreds worth of items just to get a new servant and it's exhausting.
Best gatcha game of all time. Can be fully enjoyed f2p. Funds Melty.
3‚òÖ for 3 rows ssr
I love this game it deserves 100 stars good story good combat and good Characters I find myself coming back to this game constantly even when I have other games I can play like I would rather play this than all my consoles that I have people just need to look pass the bad parts of games and focus on the good parts and this game has many good parts people just need to understand the good points are there and it is a fun game with good game management and gameplay 2000 points from me
I love the Fate franchise and this game has reached peak of their fame.
truly the game of all time
Fun and addictive don't lose your life savings
Predatory Gacha game that refuse to change for better. DO NOT PLAY
Very fun for a fan of the series
"I thought this would look like the anime, but in the year 2023, mulitimillion $ corporations still use flash. There are better high school projects, actually free to play, on kongregate(dot)com."
need better game play and better support system
Pls fix crash problem
This game is good it's fun in a lot ways. this is also entertaining and the freebies they giving is a win win situation for a player.
"Used to be great, but now keeps crashing & lagging."
Love the game but recently it started crashing on me can't battle or login or see the news or summon without it crashing or freezing wish they fix this issue
Still best gacha
"Love the game BUT seriously really really HATE the horrendous mat farm/grind! SPENDING COUNTLESS HOURS DOING THE SAME SCENARIO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH MIN. 4-5 TURN EACH ROUND IS SLOWLY DRIVING ME INSANE! It's tolerable if the gameplay is actually Exciting but NO IT'S NOT! NO ROUND AUTO-SKIP AND NP-SKIP MAKES ME WONDER IF I REALLY SHOULD KEEP THIS BS GAME!! CUZ IF THE DEVELOPER AND THE OG CREATOR CARES ABOUT THEIR PLAYERBASE, WHY CAN'T THEY CARE ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CUZ OF ENDLESS GRIND!?"
"Hate the combat system. It's cheating badly using support system. Loving the story in this. Immersive, very enjoyable. Enjoying the people and the world too. I was wrong. Even if combat isn't something I agree with, the support part, the story and characters are too good. It's very good. Highly recommend!"
"Downloaded it and played for a an hour or so, had fun spent some money. But then my phone stopped doing anything. With the apo closed. I could barely get it unlocked. Took the risk and uninstalled and look at that my phone works perfectly again. Very fun game with great character designs but not ever gonna risk downloading it again if it bricks my freaking phone."
My game ended up crashing and Uninstaller itself and now everything is gone.5 years just gone
"Loved the game, but due to constant crashing on start-up, I can't play it anymore. I cleared the cache and checked my storage, but the problem persists. Check the news update? Crash. Summons? Crash. Battles? Crash. I can't continue the current event because the game crashes when mini Jason tries to buff my team. The game's become a garbled mess."
üåóüç≤ü•Çüçæ
Please put voices in the dialogue its so much better that way! Especially the main stories!!
Well It's almost update on Android almost every 3 month now it requires v 2.35.1
Great variety of character and story. Could use some English voicee though!
Plss fix the crashing. I can't enter to get my transfer code that's why I can't uninstall because all progress will be lost.Please fix it.
"My gaming group won't shut up about FGO so I leave them w/this. I quit cold-turkey, even if it ran perfectly (never has since 10/27/2022 crashfest) I can't return in good conscience. It makes a mockery of my time (every event & battle is a grind) resources (500MB+ on 1 battle. I need my data plan for work, I can't waste 80% on FGO grind) trust (app breaks on updates, no recourse) & wallet (a peer lost $300 for 1 new sprite). Cut your losses & move on, perhaps to videogames that you actually own."
Pays for Melty Blood DLC
Hello I love this game but I lost 2 of my accounts due to breaking my phone do I have anyway to get both of them back? I have no trasfer code saved
"This game is fun and good way to kill time. However, the chances of getting a 5 star or even a 4 star is way to low. I tried to transfer my old file to my new phone, and all data is gone. I had the characters all the way back to 2018."
greatt!!
Crapy rates when summoning.
If you didn't start yet please just play on JP instead
Fate isn't opening
Game keeps crashing every 3 minutes and because of it I have barely advanced in the event
"Looks nice, however not my type of game"
Its fine.
Events are useless for new players. Only veterans can take advantage because it's too difficult. Not new player friendly
"Everyone keeps talking about FateGO, so decided to give it a try - get past the title screen, the game freezes on the loading screen and either remains frozen or it just crashes - not a good start there."
Got NP2 Space Ishtar on 4 tickets but lose 390 SQ on Taira's banner TY FGO!
I started watching the show now the game has my attention....
"It has been fun, I really like the anime so I figured I'd try this game and so far I've enjoyed it."
"Game was fine, and good if you like Fate/, but the support is terrible. My phone needed to be reset, and I couldn't load the game to get a transfer code to save and transfer my account. There is no other way. When requesting assistance through their support system, they will not get my account back because I'm lacking information to give them that no one would have. They stopped replying to my request. I've lost a 5 year old account due to their negligence. 5 years of logging in and playtime."
"Terrible translations, localizations, and censorship. WAY too much of it as well"
"what just happened? after the release of christmas event last year this game just continuously crashed, I can't even farm anymore since in the middle of the battle it will just go back to my homescreen, it's somehow currently unplayable to me."
The app automatically stopped every battle finish. Please fix itüôè
Love type moon this game is amazing if you love story rpg type games i recommend this to anyone just to try
The crush issues are solved. Thanks.
"This is not a great gacha game. It is NOT beginner friendly. Rate up is actually a lie, rates are way lower. Save your money, there is no ""reasonable"" pity gacha. You effectively have to use $1k per banner for maybe ""pity"". There really is no reason to continue playing NA when the other regional servers are ahead by 1-2 years. Story is good, but if you're here to get the characters you want... good luck because you're never getting them. Also game crashes consistently for some odd reason."
"The story is very good and the excellent characters bring everything together lovelily. That said, the game is a tad old in machanics althought the events do keep it very alive if you're OK with farming. Why is it a 3 stars then?! The gatcha. The business model alone is irksome (with the whole predatory angle) but FGO even to this day still manages to be worse than most. You can ""make do"" with free characters and the like but if you're one to not be able to let go if you fail at a roll go away!"
"Great fun. Wish they would make a pc version though, the games getting a little too fat and keeps crashing, I login-crash, I use an NP-crash, I got to a new node-crash, I start a battle-crash."

Crashed on my old Samsung Jstar frequently. Works with no problemsmy new Moto G Stylus. Could have been the age of my old phone. Pity 5star is also stupidly high and does not roll over to new banners. The story and characters have been enough to keep me playing on and off for several years.
"Been playing since 2017, love the game. It has issues, saint quartz is very expensive, if you can look past such things it is worth your time. The servant designs are awesome, the stories are great and most events are enjoyable. Had an issue where I lost my account recently and customer support was great. Took 5 days but I got it back, always have a transfer number active to avoid these issues."
"This game is basically just a gambling but instead of winning an actual useful money, you win jpeg of japanese cartoon character. The future of gaming are bleak"
Fun gacha game with good story and characters and surprising depth in gameplay
"It's a good rpg, great story. And disable and reset your updates on your smart wallpaper app to stop the crashing haven't had one since"
"Love the game, one thing i hate is the gacha rate"
"Save yourself the headache and don't play this game. This game can't link to an account, so if delete it , it's gone without a pass code. A pass code that you have to create and remember. Story mode gets out of control without some good 4- 5 stars, cause some enemies can one shot. No free 5 stars unless you go back in time or wait for a free banner that comes once a year. The vn story is fun, that's all I can admit. You are better off playing the main games to get your fate fix."
This game is absolutely unplayable I have been trying to play it for a few hours only like 10% of that was actually me playing the rest was lagging freezing and crashing that is no way to play a game do yourself a favor and don't play this laggy piece of garbage
Somehow this game gets worse
"Got my account back thanks to customer service. I keep getting connection failure to server even though my internet is fine, can't even get to home screen without having to rely on mobile data. My phone is Motorola G pure. Also, occasionally get crashes on the new event."
It's Good!
"Played perfectly fine. No crashes. Love the IP. Time, effort, and potentially money for the 0.6%-ish chance to get a servant I want. Nah, not me."
"Well been fun... but if too long a hiastas is just gonna up a delete everything I've done, effectively wasting my time and money then I suppose I'm done. Nice while it lasted"
Please make it available on SEA store so I can whale easily üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
The performance in the game has been really bad since the last update. It stutter so much its not even funny
The game is really fun but I have run into a very annoying issue. The game tends to crash every time I try and start a quest. Please fix Edit: Now it's everytime I open the game. Thanks...
You really have to have good wifi or internet to play this.üòÄ
ENERGY BASED They really need to remove AP / energy system. Otherwise great game esp if u love the fate series. Noble Phantasms done extremely well.
"I had to transfer it to my old phone because my primary one broke and despite having enough memory the game crashes before i can issue a transfer number for my new phone, it crashes as soon as i get past the title page."
Game good it just that every now and again it freezes up and crashes or it automatically shut down as very annoying fix this bug please I'll rate it 5 stars afterwards:)
It's a good game for me.
Gameplay very bad
"If you like spending money or saving for banners and suffering very very miniscule drop rates and getting absolutely nothing after saving 50,000k Gems. This is your game. Been using the same 4 star characters since I started. And if you like losing your progress after a forced reinstall after a certain update good luck getting a hold of your past account. So good luck."
the cache need work like add some step up and separate character summing cards from the equip cards to and increasce the present of 5 star and 4 star character the rest of the game is good I would like to see some crossover event as well then I will give this game 5 stars
Game is fun too play and glad that I didn't have a problem yet great work
Game recently won't let me login and says I have a connection error when my phone works perfectly fine on my connection.
fun : D
I'm in hell
Astolfo Saber is too hot and now I'm gay
It's a good game from the previews and I was hoping if there will be a release in Africa
"For my opinion this game is interesting, cause of their story line but I suggest player to download this game with higher RAM cause 2GB RAM phone can't handle this game and it can cause crash / anything else."
I LOVE FATE GRAND ORDER
"Awesome game with almost always excellent storytelling. EDIT I also stand by my five stars. Yes the update this october cause a glitch, but despite what CERTAIN trolls will have you believe, The FGO Crew already fixed it and at least the developers LISTEN to the players and write to you back! so again, please, give this game a chance, cause it is amazing!"
"This game is more on farming, but I still like it since the story has a good plot and it's really interesting."
Played for quite some time and it's a lot of fun
Update finally fixed the crashing. I wish the gacha rates were better but the game is self is great.
Glitches sometimes but is really fun to play
Give me arjuna alter np5 plz
noice
"The crashes have been fixed for a while, but have held off on changing my review until such time that I felt I wasn't getting played. Now that I know the game won't up and die on me mid-fight, I can safely say that most meta options are limited. With very little to no reruns of some of the best. GL out there"
I've been playing for years and I can say it's all worthit
"Been playing on and off for years, still hooked."
The greatest gacha
"I feel like in terms of gameplay it could be improved. But high difficulty content can be really fun to challenge. Nonetheless, the main appeal of the game is the story. If you rate this game less than a 4 you are probably the type of player that just skips through it without paying much atention to all the work behind it. Despite being a gacha, is a masterpiece."
I would rate this game a 4 star but woth the latest update the game keeps crashing and i cant even play. All i can do is login and thats it. If i try play it automatically crashes. I have reset cache and redownloaded game yet it still happens.(edit: problems went away)
this is the accurate representation of hell but its fun
Fix ur gacha system T.T
An amazing game with good characters and story.
Game ƒëb r·∫ª r√°ck
"Would give 0 stars if I could, 300 plus quartz for a ""guaranteed"" summon, what a joke."
BEST GAME EVER IVE BEEN PLAYING FOR 3 YEARS
"Been playing the game for years, and I absolutely love it, but recently it's been crashing like crazy. Every time I select a support it would freeze on a black screen then crash. It's really unfortunate, since this is such a good game."
Can't even get past the title screen without a crash
I love okita again
Hell
The story is amazing
Love it and has an amazing story.
"You cant connect to any form of social media account, so when I got a new phone and downloaded the game, guess what? I lost all of my progress. Hours upon hours of progress because a basic feature to let you connect to social media wasn't added."
oh you're a fate fan? explain the fate lore in full detail then
"I can't get my account back because I used an emulator to play this game, and apparently, it's a war crime. It's also poorly notified to players like a sticky note on a billboard. It has perhaps been 4 years and Ive been tirelessly trying to appeal. Customer support also only responds to my appeal once a year. Absurd. To you guys it's business, to us it's a game that we wish has better treatment of it's players. I wish your team the worst of the worst."
So buggy after full screen update. It crash and freeze too often.
I have an addiction to historical waifus which fuels my severe gambling addiction.
"Listing awful changes in recent updates. First things first, 5 missing beast footprints I put into a character went missing, arguably $500 worth or 2 months worth of logins. Kiara swimsuit had her right breast nerfed, and now is smaller than her left. Anyone nearby can easily interfere during a summon and basically hijack the 5* data. Zoomed the camera out like 2 updates ago, now characters are hard to see. Support was phony and lost 15 encrypted skins. management is so stupid, killed the game."
I swear it must be just me then but I still never get characters I literally only get essences in almost every 10x draw or 3 star characters it's getting bs why haven't the creators fix this already so everyone has equal opportunity especially if people can't spend hundreds of dollars on a game not everyone got money
Mash is best girl
Nice when it's not crashing. Version 2.40.4 doesnt work. It says there is a new version. Clearly there is not... anywhere...
OK so I've played fgo a longggggg time. Then took a two year break. This game is dated af and has an abysmal summon system. Saying that I don't think any of the summons are necessary and since the game is entirely single player it's not p2w. Although the top tier supports really help. What is good is that your old servants never become redundant. Edit:1 star I didn't get Murumasa
"Pity is heavily needed otherwise it just pushes more players away, especially newer players. The game is honestly good but its gacha really needs some sort of pity system or at least a top off to at least give players who opt in to pay some sort of incentive."
Great game but now after playing for 5 months it is my first time to experienced connection issues even tho my internet is good disappointed I already uninstalled the game still the same
One of the gacha game with the best story / universe out there
"very addicting, they should put our account in a google email option :/ my old acct from 2020 is lostt. Cons: too much filler fights in the main quest and repetitive. Gacha rates are super low despite reaching 100 pulls.. but NO 5 star :< Edit: gacha rates sucks, they should give more rewards like Saint quartz.. Changed rating to 1 star"
Awesome I can finally fight with servants
Dogwater on a stick in Gimmick City.
I completed my RinFace collection as of now. NOW HURRY UP AND RELEASE SUMMER ERESHKIGAL ALREADY!!
I LOVE IT.
"Please fix the stuttering on Poco X4 GT is killing me, the lag and the stuttering."
"Literally takes the ntire year to save up enough crystals to summon a 5 star. You have to drop money or summon 350 times. The devil need to fix the drop rates, or lower the required amount, or give out crystals more than 1 at a damn time"
Mash best kouhai
"I like the game because I love fate and for a gacha its age it'd be unfair for me to nitpick at its gameplay loop, the only reason this isn't a 4 or 5 is because these rates are abysmal I've been playing for a year and I've not received a 5 star servant since the anniversary and I'm lucky to pull 4 stars servants from time to time, Craft essence bloats the banners significantly because the rates are upto 3x the servants"
"This is a great game but i gave it 3 stars because of ""Failed to connect to the game server"" , i have to use a vpn to make it work which is annoying because i have to open it everytime i want to play."
"Definitely a worthwhile game, but only if you have self-control. It goes without saying that it is a gacha game and one with a 1% chance to get a five star servant. Depending on the type of phone you have, you may experience crashes, but most issues are usually fixed before they become a problem."
"Aight, it seems like with the JP'S lag problem with some nodes, I noticed that even on the EN version as well. Hope it might be fixed as well."
"I use an LG Stylo 6. As per the recent updates, the game has been crashing and lagging far more frequently. My usual fix (Opening then exiting the app drawer), doesn't work- instead I get booted back to the start-up screen. It's a shame. I really enjoy this game and the events. However, I have no choice but to stop playing because the issues render it nigh-unplayable due to the lag. Would I recommend? Yes. But I recommend caution until the issues are fixed and the screen freezing is addressed."
"It would be so good that you can link your progression to a facebook or google account, so you don't need to transfer your account to any new device. The lack of this feature is what prevents me to rating five stars."
For some reason it won't let me download Can't even play it
I was way further in this game with lots of great summons but once I uninstalled it and reinstalled I couldn't get my account back and whatever I do it would only start from the beginning no welcome back player or anything just from the start so my honest suggestion is please connect your game with google or fb or anything so that player could return and get their data back and not start from scratch again.
Terrible 10/10
have sunk many hours into this game
A fun casual game for Fate fans.
This app was even more boring than the ad
Best way to lighten my wallet and drop my account balances back down to poverty levels
i love this game it makes me really want to kms becuase of ur gacha I would recommend for suic cidal teens like meüòç
One of the best game i have ever played
"Been playing this for a while now. Never had any problems, now I cant launch the game unless I'm connected to wifi. Keep getting messages saying network is unstable to try later. Getting really annoying, there has been 4 updates since this started and none of them have address. Fix the issue. I'll fix my review."
Pls give me luck
Game won't give me Jeanne alter
"Great story, good events(sometimes even great), a lot of favourite characters. But a bit boring(and sometimes broken) gameplay, not very friendly gacha (at least f2p servants can cover a lot) and endless grind. Although it's a hellish rabbit hole, don't go there..."
Space ishtarless
"Definitely one of my most favorite mobile games! The story is well-written and even brought me to tears a couple of times! The gameplay is pretty addicting. The gacha system seems a bit steep, but all of the characters are well fleshed out and loveable that I don't mind saving up my SQ to roll for them when their banners arrive! Lately, there have been a lot of moments where the game lags and hangs, but other than that, I still think it's a fun game after playing it for years already."
It won't open
"Guess I'll give an actual review. When it comes to the gameplay itself it's standard turn based with extra mechanics that are diffrent enough that it dosent feel stale. Even when not taking the new jp update we just got. If you don't like gacha then don't play the game man cause, even when pity gets added it's still a pretty high cap to get to. So how you feel about the gacha is probably gonna be a big make or brake for you. Besides all that though the story is amazing both main and events."
Due to an update a few months back the game breaks for me. The character models turn black or become invisible leaving the outlines. The background becomes black or miss most of it. The servant in their NPs become purely black. And the repeatable beast fight has some major glitches
"Game durjana , ditinggal atau pensi sayang. Di mainin bikin pala pecah"
Please make it available in Pakistan
2000 days still stuck at this game
aaaaaa gacha salt so far
BEST GAME EVAHHH
"Graphics, Voiceover, Characters, Rewards, Animation is Too Good but the Rateup for each character/Servant rather is kinda debatable but its Okay I Do really expect to Make this game more more better in the future updates"
"Been playing the game for almost 3 years, and while I enjoy the gameplay, the tendency to slow down at times can be a bad experience."
"Always been a fan of strategy games games like this, also works well in my device, story is enjoyable and satisfactory. Decided to play the game since my friend recommended it."
"Gilgamesh was the only reason I rated it 5stars, The gacha is insane when you try to pull for RNG summons but whatever. As a endgame player....Pretty much alright."

So much money. I love getting my fav charas!!
best storyline
nice game but the pity system makes me cry I've usee all my squats and didn't even get muramasa.üò©üò≠
Worst game I've ever played.
Events I missed out on due to constant crashing: Halloween 2022 Thanksgiving 2022 Christmas 2022 New Years 2022 and what is soon to be Saber Wars 2023 I will update this whenever new content comes out.
Reception for new players is pathetic. Care about new players and maybe they'll care about you.
It has Astolfo in it :)
"200++ SQ for unwanted Craft Essence and Servant, thanks game"
The game crashes and freezes constantly to the point that the game is unplayable. Do not waste your time until it is fixed
Don't even have a skip button for np sick of watching video you can't skip and the banner rate up is a lie
"Install, Uninstall F.G.O. once I go back to login . so I just lose my profile account, save progress. What is it for me to do to save it on game drive!!?? // Prisma Code replay to me Cool Kool , O I know how to receive saved progress // Place my true feelings about this game awesome and even more girl Cruises it's so Remarkable success üòâ‚ù£üéÆ‚ù£"
Great game. Unfortunately even $500 can't buy you your desired servant. What's the point of even a supporting a game that barely has a pity when you can't get a single copy of your desired character. You're better off playing Genshin Impact because they too have a great story and at least they have a pity system. A shame because I loved this game.
Peak game like subway surface
The game is still unplayable it crashes at the menu i cant even play it
Audio crashes in battle please fix
The story is great and the event's are exciting. I must have for Fate fan's.
Game is good and all but due to some recent updates in the game. It keeps on crashing on certain loadouts such as during using NP or using skills in the game not playable sometimes.
Lots of lag. And rates are poor. Don't spend money on it
"I used to really enjoy playing this game, but I unfortunately have to give it a terrible rating due to recent problems. I haven't been able to play it for several months now due to constant crashes after and often before reaching the title screen. I have done everything I can on my end and have confirmed it isn't a hardware issue, yet I and many others are suffering from this problem. I have missed out on numerous events and limited time summons because of this."
"So I just saw the add for the three white knights summon and got excited for Arthur prototype. Then, when I get to that point, I see that his summon is locked behind paid saints quartz. If you are going to advertise things like this, be upfront about the fact that you must pay to even have a chance at getting the unit in question. If I could, I would give this a zero."
Keren cokkkk
"Broken. Game crashes every 3-5 minutes. At first thought it was my phone but after looking it up this has been a problem in general for over six months. Don't bother with this game, they don't care enough to fix it when it becomes unplayable."
I hate having a forced tutorial where I can't touch settings or log in first. Very irritating. Also wish they had googe login for cloud back up
"I'm enjoying the Game, but also experience weird freezes since a few updates ago. Really annoying when a huge portion of the game consists of farming resources."
"""Drop rate up!"" Spent 1,000 free crystals and no said ""increased drop rate character""."
"This game is actually hot garbage now. Pity is at a whopping 330 rolls, which I'm starting to wonder that they actually lowered the rates so most players will hit the cap. There's also the issue of it randomly crashing out of nowhere and suddenly freezing during farming sessions that makes it nigh unplayable. For those planning to play this game, don't. This game is a terrible timesink and money sink and you will never get the most out of it without dishing money."
Lost all the motivation Spent around 600 sq and still didn't get any sr or ssr.
"Amazing visuals, beautiful story and knows how to reward its players, I recommend FGO for lots of newcoming Gacha players!"
"Not bad, but I can't say good either. It's Boring. I mean, it's not the only game that has long story dialogue (that is kind irrelevant unless you actually care about the entire backstory of the universe) and character cliches. Some cliches are usable to get the audience interested, but when they get used constantly. It becomes repetitive and you'll hate them in general. Eats storage and crashes just like twisted wonderland. Guess both got released as grabs and never got fixed bc deal with it ^"
"I have an S22 Ultra and the game has been running smoothly for a good while so good job guys, now I can go back to do the events and remaining Lostbelts, thank you."
"I think it's one of the best gacha games I know and play. It's rewarding, tiring, annoying, has waifus just like any other gacha game, but most of all it's fun."
"Because of this game, I really considered going to therapy and wellness mental health sessions. This game is really straining on my mental health. All everyone wants me is my money. This game just solidified it. I will re install this game in 2 hours."
Went to see if they updated the combat and saw my stuff was all gone because the system to save account info is trash. Time to restart and see if my opinion on the combat changes at all.
"Do you like farming 3 hours for a single material you need 60 of? Do you like saving currency a whole year for a PNG,inevitably fail to get said PNG then massacring your wallet to satisfy your gambling tendencies? If you answered yes to both then this game is surely for you"
I'm gonna giveup now enough pain I have been getting CE n Ce for past 6months Disappointed again and again but I didn't give up for this one day I saved SQ tickets everything I could yet didn't get a single gold idk what to do with this game anymore I don't have any reason I didn't wanted to quit but I had to I can't play a game when my lucks sucks so bad at this game I will remember how beautiful the game was back when i was playing story. GoodBye Fate Ce order great Game it was I ‚ù§Ô∏è the story.
Too much grind for obnoxiously low summon rates.
This game keeps crashing. Won't even let me play and I've spend 30 minutes pressing retry and restart. I've cleared the cache and reinstalled. Oh well. Over 4 years of game play and collecting wasted. Still not working...
Gacha rateup is an absolute lie over 200sq no muramasa
"Played this game for years. QoL just keeps getting better as well as getting the sooner than when JP server did. Friendly to new players, great story. If you are a fan of the varies Fate series, light novel, games, manga, anime be sure to expect lots of fanservice and easter eggs."
Hey I just transferred my account and now when I log in I can't play the game my app is stuck on a black screen and wont continue no matter what I do please fix this have have several limited servants and I don't wanna restart my account
"I enjoy the quality of the story whenever the newer main chapters get released. And being PvE, I appreciate there being no guild or PvP matches that you need to participate in, so I can take my time in progressing with how I like."
I NEVER HAD THIS (‚Å† ‚Å†ÔΩ•‡∏±‚Å†Ôπè‚Å†ÔΩ•‡∏±‚Å†)
Add skip animation plss. Games good btw.
my biggest issue is the game keeps crashing otherwise its a great game
Waifu.
It's a pretty fun just make a auto mode
Love this game but there has been a lot of crashing of late that makes it borderline impossible to play or doing anything at all I'll most likely change the score when it get fixed Edit: It seems to be a preformance issue with certain phones as soon as I upgraded to a new phone it vanished but I'll raise the score regardless
Got the same servant that I already have on ggsr. Waste of money. Could have at least gave me something new. Maybe add a filter where I can avoid getting similar copies of servant might help.
"Crash, crash and more crash, unplayable... I have Samsung galaxy a10"
Damn stupid game cant be playable after 2 weeks
I can't get it to the game it's rigged.
"I Like the game itself because the stories are awesome and the gacha is bad because the rate up is a lie, but the transfer code sucks you know why because when you use your transfer code to another device and the internet slows down at that time then it will takes time to load then after that loading you can't enter anymore because it will pop a message says ""The transfer ID is already in use"" and what if there is an event that needs a streak to login then goodbye rewards, you will lose it."
Stuck in conformation party screen
Incredible story without the need to spend any real life money to get complete to it. The gacha system is ruthless though so be prepared to leave hope at the door.
"The game itself is incredible, but is is very grindy, and for a 10 pull it offers a 3 star servant which you will get anyway. At a minimum it should be a 4 star servant."
After playing for 3 years this is my favorite waifu game.
Well i got muramasa so i'll give it 5starüëçüòù but i still want super orion and space ishtar üòÑ
Pretty good game but the redownload data made my account disappear so yeah trash game for sure it needs to burn in hell
Stop with the ads jfc
I like the character designs. Japan always make their characters look appealing and for that I like it. Okita is now my favorite character in fiction

Never got my account back. Described it to a tee and still they couldn't get it back. Oh well
I have a hate and love relationship.

Please fix your game for android users I can't even play missions without the game just shutting off on me now and I played this game when it first came out on an older version android than the one I currently using and I never had this happen before.
"Great story, appealing and well written characters, and meh gameplay loop. What is the problem? The gacha. This is closer to gambling than most other gacha in the point that's there is no reasonable gurantee for low-to-mid spenders or free to play. You need about $400-500 dollars to gurantee a single copy of a 5 star charscter. Pity doesn't tranfer either, so you're left saving for a long time if you wanna stay free to play or low spender. That's why 3 stars."
I hate this game
this truly was our fate grand order
The support team is so quick and efficient üôèüôèüôè
700 saints quarts still won't get u the character u want even in the pool his drop rate is up
"I can't play any nodes - as soon as I hit ""Start Quest,"" the game crashes and I'm sent back to my phone's home screen. I have loved this game for so long and would just like to be able to play again :-(. üòîüòîüòîüòûüòûüòûüò¢"
Annoyed with gacha system
"It's a good game but I spent 3 80 dollars on this game but still didn't get my servan, wasn't the pity system supposed to at least give me one?"
Peyt grand order
Wow Gssr event for 15 quarts a steal...... You can't use Quarts you farm and needs you to buy it.l and here i was looking forward to it. Well that was a let down
"Great story, beautiful character design"
I hate this
"Great story, viable F2P gameplay. But if you aren't F2P the gacha rates are nightmarishly bad. Be warned."
"7 years too late, animations looks like from a year 2000 browser game"
"I love the game! I really do! I've been playing it for years and having a blast! But as of the most recent update, I literally cannot even load up the game without it crashing. I barely get past the main menu screen without it crashing again, and it's honestly really frustrating. (Update: this problem has now been fixed!)"
increase heart drop rates pls
I wish there's a way for F2F players to join the GSSR banner like 500 SQ for F2F players to spend I doubt there's anyone willing to bust that much SQ üòÜ
Gacha Hell
Rates are 00.1 for a 5 star actually Appalling
This is a great and fun game but the only problem is the bug that a been experiencing lately when a tap on the start up screen it just leave on a black screen.
"Great game, Unfortunately i can't even log in anymore. Its always failing to connect to the server even if i have a great internet connection"
Active developers and good story
I enjoy
"Just want my husband, Astolfo"
I <3 this game so much
"The Game itself is awesome but I'm disappointed It didn't save any of the characters that I had on my old phone, when I switched to this phone üò≠"
"Fun game with great story. The gacha is awful but in the end, FGO is amongst the funnest games I ever played, currently is my main game. HOpefully make the game more stable; it freezes up for no reason and one time it froze so badly that i could not do anything even when restarting game and clearing cache, so i had to reinstall game. Also please add a reasonable pity system as it sucks to spend a lot of pulls just to get nothing"
Pity where
The game is great only problem is it laggs constantly
"I love the game but pls fix the game, it keep crashing and it is unplayable."
"Fate is overall one of the best anime in the world the franchise is huge so fgo being a thing is great.But there is a huge problem you can't connect to Google play or loginin,in any sort of way"
"A fun, Grindy game. Lots of fun which you can F2P pretty easily."
Seigi no mikata
"You don't know how much I'm obsessed with this stupid series. It has been a huge part of my life. Despite the merciless gacha rates, and how outdated this game can be, the amazing story, side events and the characters make up for it. This game runs smooth as butter on my tablet, and I can even use my pen. Low battery usage, too. There is occasional freezing though, hoping it gets fixed. So, thank you devs. Here's to another year of hell."
"1) Please consider adding a more permanent account binding, such as email for example 2) The game crashes before you can even play it (playing on Android) I really like this game (even at its most frustrating times), so it feels pretty disappointing to not even be able to play especially when events come up."
too buggy
Still better than most.
"Price increase for SQ is bad. Different from JP. That alone is why they deserve 1 star. Pity is a bad joke. Coupled with the price increase, I'm going full F2P."
"Changed review back to 5, performance was fixed. One of the most solid gacha games I've played, very engaging story with a lot of well written characters. Lots of free servants through the year with awesome rewards for us the players. Great and unique way to implement co-op where you can use other people's servants. Beautiful art direction (specially with noble phantasms), some sprites look aged, but most servants have very artsy animations. Overall a very complete and satisfying experience."
Fun game Some good characters Abysmal gacha rates
"Game crashes entirely too often. Mostly when loading a stage or inbetween phases. On average, it'll crash once or twice per stage. Please fix this."
It's a good game when it isn't crashing.
It good
A fan of Fate series so ill give it a 4.... But damn Drop rates for Heroes is so low.... Give us a ssr servant pplllssss....... edited: Take it back.... for some reason im got luck with my second acc. ... keep up zhe good work..
Thanks for all the hard work keep it up.
Please add a save button
Nice game i love astolfol
Hey dev what are you doing to fix this crashing issues? Now I can't continue playing this great game.. So many bug issues to fix.. üòî
"For the love of God, i have no idea why, but i cannot make/ use the game on split screen despite allowing permission for it. Same goes for my sis. Please allow us to use the app in split/ floating screen again."
Best and worse game of the whole gaming industry
The story is amazing The gameplay is easy to understand but hard to master There is a lot of amazing characters to pick from ftp (3 Stars Servants or below) To 4-5 Stars Servants The gacha is hell (you gonna appreciate more your 5 Stars Servants if you pull one) There is al ot of content and events to keep players busy
"F2P friendly, makes you care about the characters and collect them, a good amount of content and a good story that keeps you in the game. FGO does a great job being a game you want to invest your time into."
Great game for waifus
"Great combat mechanics, great characters, and a 10/10 story."
it's very fun but it occasionally doesn't or incorrectly load a character model or image like summon banner or Ishtar or something
Auto deploy where
After the big update where speed up is available and with the added 60 fps the game starts crashing and a lot of fps drops hope you guys fix it
Excellent game gg type moon
"Takkun, NOBU NOBU, I hope you see this. Send an email to the devs official email, and either provide the information they ask for about your account, or wait for a reply of a list of info to provide. Keep your reply email of your info neat, and as accurate as you can! The devs helped me get my account back with THE SAME bug as you, I put it on a new phone and poof! I hope you read this!"
"The story is amazing, the characters are interesting, and the challenge and story battles are interesting."
Lucky gacha rolls
This game is awesome!
"Love the game, love the series"
"The game is currently unplayable for me, it crashes all the time q_q"
"As someone with a 5/6 year old android phone this game runs fine, sure it has minor stutters but my phone is old, so yeah. Story is great, legit 9/10. Gameplay is 8/10 turnbased with some strategy to it. Music 10/10 bro for a f2p game music bangs hard. Been a F2P for 3 years and got almost all servants I wanted no problem, game isn't hard in fact its getting easier with story free revive items so idiots don't have to complain about using quartz to revive. Selfrestrain in gacha, of course."
"Careful, that's hell you're walking into."
Glitches when trying to load the title screen
Muramasa the goat is coming soon.
Best gacha game
"Was probably good back in the day, but for new F2P players, years of power creep and an absolutely PITILESS gacha make this just not worth it. You can still beat stages with temporary ""friend support"" characters that can be totally OP and carry your party, but at that rate, why not just watch it on Youtube or something. You're not really playing yourself, you just watch someone else's party fight. Old 5* characters are nearly useless for the current meta and you're not getting even those at 1%"
"I wasted my money o this goddamn game, I want a refund. I tried to go back in the game, but the entire gameplay is artificially extended so you have to pay to win, even if they give you the means to acquire servants, you depend on the banners to get characters that have multi hit properties to actually build a proper buffing NP or quick damage enough to pass, old characters still have single hit animations and sup bar skills. The old backup system is gone so you can't recover your old accounts"
"This is impressive. Never before have I experienced a game where the creators seem to care a not single bit about their players as this game tbe last few ""updates"" that were supposed to fix bugs have instead only caused it to crash sooner and sooner. I crashed during the INITIAL LOADING SCREEN. Creators, testers, whatever. If you say you're going to fix your game, how about you ACTUALLY fix it?"
I cant connect to the server since 12/18/2022 i already reinstalled the app but still i cant connect to the server
This Christmas event for karna Santa is the most unfair conditions ever. You forcing them to clean through all 10 rounds of items to finish the story when the point is to get the key items to unlock the story chapters. You removing the skip button to next round to roll for the next event items without needing to clean up the rest of the stock like last other Christmas events left me feeling like this gimmick will stay to affect more unfairly in other events as it's a waste on getting other items
"I really enjoy this game the updates to it and the fun new servants and story are great, but if I can't even connect to the sever what's the point. Please fix the server issues"
Enable the ability to link your account to Google so nobody loses their passwords anymore. Games that make less than this one have that feature - there's no excuse. And customer service is terrible.
Favorite phone game but I can't even start the the game after last update
"Game is literally unplayable, I can't get past the title screen without it crashing. Devs need to fix asap"
"Good game,the gacha rate is suck tho"
"Excellent story, difficult battles. But well balanced for the most part. The humor and the side stories that take the seriousness of the main story away are so good. My only complaints are the grind can be tedious in events and the pity system is a joke for whales only. Very generous with new content and free SQ"
Games fun but a bit grindy.
I can't even play this game every time I try to log in and kicks me out
I cant even play because when it tries to get to the main menu it closes out on its own and i have plenty of data room
"Best mobile game, no autoplay turn based game with very good story. The only problem is gachahell..."
Putangina niyo ayusin niyo yung gacha system niyo boborokbok tangina 60sq nagastos ko tapos puro putanginang craft essence bibigay niyo saken mga gahaman pakyu pisot bayot tangina niyo Amen
I think it nice
"Was working for a while, now is crashing constantly. Unable to play. Update 12/22: game is working again. Had to temporarily switch from Webview to Webview Canary when I was experiencing crashes."
Great game you got here. Much appreciated. Thank you...
"Great game, in fact, the best mobile game have played. It's a bit old on some aspects but the gameplay is good and the story is fantastic, although it does take a bit of time to really get going. FGO's most controversial aspect is without a doubt the gacha, especially since the rates are quite bad. However it manages to stay really f2p friendly since: 1) the game is pretty generous when it comes to giving out currency 2) many free units are completly busted"
"Not working, connection impossible to game server. Idk what even this game is about couldn't connect once. So TRASH devs I guess."
Astolfo best boy
The app is working fine now. I don't have any issues with crashes anymore.
Not very good game anymore unable to help me with the problem with they cause with their event now I'm unable to play the game they haven't fixed all the issues so this is 2022 I'm quitting the game it gets one star
Wayyyyyyy to laggy
"I quit playing 3 years ago, the reason? Can't connect to game server bug. Now I did not quit because I lost my account. I was prepared for that, but the reaaon I quite 3 years ago was that getting to play the game became a hassle. I had to use an emulator because for some reason the game server does not connect to when I use my phone. Skip 3 years, new phone, played again and we have the same problem now after just 3 weeks. I wanna play it but the game does not want me to and support can't help."
I want Morgan le Fay (Berserker) Plss
The games doesn't start up anymore and crashes a lot. Idk why.
Crashes very time tried to log in stupid updates please fix if not I will lose everything I have done on this game
Too much bug and the game crashes all the time
"When I play the game it always Crashers and I have to re-open it again,if it is a bug pls fix it."
"This game is amazing, the storys great, and most events are worth the playtime, but the bad reviews you'll read about fgo are MOSTLY because of the performance issues. From experience this is true, however keep in mind that because fgo updated to a better engine years ago, older generation phones with a cap on processing are gonna have a bad time. I switched from a galaxy j7 to a 10+ and the app runs smooth as butter, even for the more heavily updated JP server, and was well worth the switch."
Gets stale but waifus for life. Game keeps crashing for a while now. Devs really need to find the bug for this because this is happening to a lot of veteran players.
What's wrong with your game? It keeps hanging in battle then it will force close. Yohoo is somebody doing something for these problems How do you expects us to play your game if its keep crashing I can't play the event because of these problems fix it please a P2W game but can't even fix a hang problem.
I love fate GO and I'm a huge fate stay night veteran üíôüíôüòäüòä massive shout-out to Aniplex USA and Type Moon for localizing it
"Very very very outdated, old fashioned gacha. Terrible rates. Way too many units to pull. Grind is insane with no quality of life. Was good when it first came out. Now it's a waste of time."
"Achievement Unlocked: ""How did we get here?"""
I've played this game for years. And now lately I haven't been able to play it at all. Every time I tap into the game menu. I end up logging out of it. And I barely get a chance to collect the bonuses or start gameplay. If there's some kind of bug in the game. Please fix it!
The support won't let old player come back to the game even with purchase history shown.
so i had to get a new phone because my old one unalived itself on me so now i have no way to transfer my account
"The game used to run fine but ever since the Imginary Scramble event, the game now crashes often and issues loading things like the map, Noble Phantasms and sprites. Clearing the cache doesnt do much either."
The game is fun but for some reason i can't get it to work on my phone so has the game crashed or something?
Loses my interest after a while and I can't play and cook because there's no auto battle. At this point it's wasting space unless something cool comes up but you have to make sure you can even play it. Since there's events that need a partially part open there's times I just wait for the event to go away
Just a beautiful piece of work. The sound effects are in sync with everything perfectly and the music fits every moment. The storyline is incredible. It's so big and vast for a mobile game. Work is put into every small detail that creates the beautiful picture. Everyone who worked on this needs praise. Thank you for this amazing game!
Previously I made a 1 star review regarding the crashes when playing. It's been fixed and you can experience the wonderful writing once again.
"I keep getting ""failed to connect to the downloading server"" message non-stop whenever i use wifi connection"
üò≠üò≠üò≠. Gacha rate sucks!
"After 4 reinstalls it seems to finally work, first battles were interesting, being able to bring a random lvl 50 with your lvl 10 seems pretty op as it makes levels progress very quickly. but even so I like it as lore seems pretty big so hope for more! edit: after reaching higher levels, I loved the game mechanics and each servant is super interesting to learn more lore on!"
"Once again, DW/Lasengle has managed to royally screw up a Christmas event. Bringing back the crash bug from a few months ago, yet somehow worse, this time limited lotto event has been unplayable for many players for almost half the event now. And to add insult to injury they make the moronic decision to release a title version update to fix Saint quartz continuation crashes? A problem no one should realistically encounter more than a handful of times if ever, especially in a farming heavy event?"
"Keeps locking up when I use the menu for summoning, middle of game play, and other times -- makes the great game almost worthless to have on phone."
Played it for too long to hate it. Only suggestion I can give is to make late game content (90+) somewhat more unique (like giving caster class a penalty?). Right now it's the same strategy of 4 broken supports + 1 dps in almost every challenge quest.
"I really like it, but my problem is that it lags so much!"
Good !
Gacha games are like part time jobs The difference is you use your salary for characters that you constantly abuse in a never ending farming simulator. Welcome to gacha hell that is if want to you call it that.
"It's definitely old now. Better play other PvE centric games that actually has more playground for the units that you pull since the end game when you maxed out all of your units is legit just bond farming and logging in for login bonus, quite abysmally barren for something that has existed for 7 years in total (going by JP lifespan)."
Banger
The app is crashing more often after the 2022 Santa event update.
"Still too many issues with this app. First the constant crashing that lasted for months before they finally fixed the issue in mid Nov. Now the app keeps saying ""failed to connect to game server"" even though my wifi is fine. Had to use a VPN to get around it but overall the devs are doing a poor job maintaining the app."
"Overall positive experience with the game, but some major performance issues in terms of crashing. Had the game crash on me when I used some Saint Quarts to continue, and now the game won't let me past the start screen."
"Over 6 months ago an update broke the game for every Android user. It took a few months before they even tried to attempt any kind of fix. Not surprising, it was nothing more than a bandaid that probably made things worse for the majority of people. Let us be honest at this point, Fate/Grand Order is not currently compatible with Android devices. When will this get fixed? Not even the devs know the answer to that question. My guess is not anytime soon. Nothing but a bloated app at this point."
I can't get in the game
"This game is fun, but the constant crashing and me being able to not even load into the game is a big problem. However if you run this game on Nox player it's a way better experience so if you have a PC get it on Nox player"
"The game is very good, I love the history and the characters but with the recently update that started last month the game doesn't stop crashing when I start a battle or try to upgrade my servants, even in summon the game just close and I need to open again EVERY TIME. That's so stupid and sincerely affect a lot my experience to keep playing."
Very strange. Downloaded the full file 10gb but still doesn't get past the splash screen. Please help.
Game is fine but after the last update the game crashed and I had to clear the cache which wiped all my progress! Game doesn't have cloud or link to an online account but instead uses Nintendo style code/system id transfers so if something goes wrong with the game or your phone say bye bye to months-years of data! Please join the 21st century and use online or linked accounts!
After the update the game crashes so much that it became unplayable. Hoping for a quick fix
"The current bug of crashing is basically stopping me to play the game, as i dont have the patience to keep re-opening the game over and over again in the hope that it works. Other than the bug, i absolutely love this game. Note: its a phone problem of mine, as on my tablet it works completely fine"
Really good game. Just wish the game would sync with progress between devices.
This is one of the worst mobile games put out to date. The servers are so unforgivably slow that it really takes away from the experience. The fact that the developers have the audacity to charge you for anything when they can't even put out a well functioning game just shows the state of the game industry. I've uninstalled this and won't ever be playing it again.
It is a good when you are able to grasp the macanics. Highly recommend guides on YouTube to become more familiar with the game and it's different servants.
HartzIV
ASTOLFO WRYYYYYYYYY IM ENJOYING MY LIFE
"I've always been a big fan of the Fate series, and this is no exception!"
"Every time there is a major update, the game seems to have issues with starting or crashing and now it won't let me log in at all currently."
crash..Crash..CRASH all this game ever does now is crash every chance it can get it's actually infuriating! This has been happening since the Las Vegas event ReRun and they STILL haven't fixed it! The crashing and black screens just keep getting WORSE! The update that was supposedly gonna fix all this was suppose to happen last month and where is it?? I genuinely love this game and it's story I've been playing since it dropped so I hate talking negatively but things need fixing NOW! FIX THIS!
Pog game
"Never dealt with a game so disrespectful of your time. They've removed easy access to LB Event CE's. No skip tickets or auto-rerun. Yet they release new units and stages that counteract each other (2 units 2nd wave) in regards to farming. Login rewards are mediocre, and the Login events are an insult. Seriously, you miss one day and you forfeit all rewards. What kind of event is that? Why log in after missing a day? Events being gated to Lostbelts is rough, especially for newer players."
The game was great so please deloper can you create an account sign up that when you enter a game there's no other opposite that I can borrow some other characters I mean that my own character so it will be good if just like that ü§î but it's great so I give 4 star for now if you can do. That I'll make this 5 Star.
I mean it's fun to play. Also Waifu
Im new to fate soo.. I just think this game cool asf.
Newest update causes game to crash regularly
"Every update meant to fix the random crashes has only made things worse, to the point that I can't even login anymore."
"Fun battle system, cool character designs, good VN type story. I have over a hundred hours probably and havent spent any money."
"Editing my review to 4-stars thanks to still telling a good story and fixing the bugs and stability issues the client had before. Gacha game that can become repetitive if you grind, but a great game for short bursts of playtime."
Pls unban me
"It's an all too obvious rating. This game deserves no less than 5‚òÖ from me, AND it's the only mobile RPG for the series that I would consider playing."
Fun game lots of info on historical figures.
Wow!
"Not sure if the freezing bugs fixed or if they're just early game. Anyways, gameplay is decent, story is great. Graphics are good in a flash animation sort of way. Obviously, the gacha sucks, but you can forgive it with the story quality."
This game is AMAZING!!! Though the gacha system can be a pain. Otherwise great graphics and amazing story! Update: The bugging and shutting itself off had been fixed!!
Best mobile game ever made. The characters and story keep you engaged. The actual gameplay is action/strategy and super addictive. Tons of events and dailies keep you busy.
I love it I am a fan of the anime so to play it was really a good time
i love this game but the gacha rates suck and make me depressed
"After the new update, somehow can't proceed to the game. Still stuck at title screen."
"The game has been working fine for me so far, but now all of a sudden I'm experiencing a bug where the screen turns black after the initial startup screen. I've already tried restarting my phone and deleting the cache, and even updated the game. I cannot uninstall and reinstall, I just put my account on my new phone and hadn't created another code yet. Please fix this, I've been a consistent player for years and I can't lose this account."
It's great game
"Rates so terrible it'll give you a mild depression after not getting anything but trash after your well saved SQ. This game is CRUEL for no reason. DON'T PLAY if you're looking for a gacha to chill into because it requires ALOT of time and effort for you to get the materials for leveling up, and events are HELL to as it requires to play everyday. The story is awesome though (literally the only reason why im still playing this game), it makes up for it's very terrible dogsht gacha rates."
"I've played this game for a good few years, and it's a pretty great game, all things considered. Plenty of events and updates, upgrades to older characters with new ones that can break the game with a little strategy."
"Love and hate the game. To all new and existing gacha players, welcome to another type of hell üòàüòà"
"Since i Got Hijikata Toshizo, im giving you a 5 star :) YOOO! and i got king hassan with just 4 tickets Tnx"
Issue Fixed üëç
Constantly crashes and is unplayable. This has not been fixed for months.
I am a real sucker for this game. I play this game daily. Story: 5/5 and there's alot of it in this mobile app. You will be entertained for a great while. They're not short like other RPG games. They're v long. This game is mostly story telling! It's the strong point. The story will make you love the characters. / OST 5/5 never disappoints. Boss osts are my favorite. / Gacha 1/5. gacha ruins lives / Characters Designs 4.9/5 / Art+Backgrounds: 5/5 / Gamplay fights 3/5. / Grind 3/5 (not that bad)
My wallet is suffering but I'm not. I love pretty much everything about Fgo
Good points: 1. Great story 2. Great music 3. Great characters 4. Fun gameplay 5. Challenging yet fair quests. Bad point: low gacha rate can sometimes be frustrating.
"I play on a samsung note s22 ultra and It used to run really well, until they started to update the game and now I can't even enter the battle. What I mean Is that once i try to enter or try to play it doesn't even work. Please fix this (I also tried the settings to make the game run faster but it's still crashes) Edit: It now works great again so Im going to put 5 stars"
"I have no complaints aside from the brutal rates in the gacha. The unique thing about this game is that even the low rarity units are very viable even for veteran players. Gameplay may be dated, but overall, it has aged well. I just wish the older servants would get an animation overhaul and some tweaks to make them relevant in the current meta."
rate this game 10/10
It's good. But I'm lagging so much and now I'm experiencing crash mid-fight ar while rolling
All Father forgive me for I'm about to drop my full paycheck again
Pretty not nice to me that i lose my account all my hard work is gone after you unstalled it or deleted the game and then if you come back your progress will be gone But the game is pretty ok good
"Can't get the game to load on my brand new device, I'm connected to wifi and have 5g data."
"Es un gran juego que llev√°bamos tiempo esperando tiene mucha calidad, pero es una pena que despu√©s de esta actualizaci√≥n no permite siquiera pasar de la pantalla de inicio. Por favor arreglen el problema para seguir disfrutando de esta aplicaci√≥n"
12 bbn
Story is good.
"Complete trash As a fan of the anime, I was horribly disappointed by the appalling writing. While the base plot is interesting, it reads like a fanfiction written by a twelve year old. The combat is also boring, especially by turn based rpg standards. Imo don't waste your time and definitely not your money. There are way better options."
Run away
"Best game with great story telling that i havent seen in a long time, cant believe this is a mobile game"
"Refuses to connect to game server, will change to a higher star rating when it works."
"Definitely a much better game than its competition. The mechanics are simple, the character sprites are beautiful, and the story is compelling. Edit: when will the game add the Welfare Servant in the shop? The devs said that they will implement it but all we have was BB's quest."
Astolfo saber hot.
"Experience is very f2p friendly, unlike some other gachas I have playex"
"no bind account option, trash game, one dimensional gameplay, boring events, no sweep system"
Couldn't play game for about 5 or 6 months because of game breaking glitch and recieved no compensation. Thanks thieves
The game is fun won't lie story telling is amazing but gacha for characters sucks and earning the needed to summon.
"I love this game and all but now when I want to play it again, it's giving me the black screen and it just stays like that, if this is a big, can you ease fix it?"
I'm disappointed that the same issues keeps occurring whenever an event comes along. It never used to be this horrible.
"Loved the story but it's getting harder to play the game with all the bugs it's experiencing. Sometimes the sound lags, and right now I can't even log-in because it cannot connect to the servers."
A money dump. But it's the Fate universe so does it matter? You get exactly what you expect except for characters.
Terrible customer support I tried to recover my account and they were not helpful and the second time I was completely ignored.
It tells me that failed to connect to server despite of me having wifi and i tried to delete then install it but it's the same
Would be a 5 star if customer service would stop ignoring my account recovery email.
It won't let me download
Can't play it. Keeps crashing on me.
"I am in severe medical, therapeutical and loan debt from this game. 5 stars"
"Edited: Even with the nov21 update, I am still not able to log, I keep getting black screen on the starting screen, I hope that this gets solved soon. That black screen is like forever. I know it isn't my phone storage since I have at least 64gb and my internet is fine. I hope that this is fixed soon, since I am going to miss the banner and my log in strikes."
This game is a waste of time what's the point of trying to log in if it never even works
Game keeps crashing before I can get to the main screen and from what I've seen this problem has been getting worse and worse
This game is hell
Poop
Game lagging and app freeze phone not safe
wish this would run smooth on my device
Best story and gameplay
mimiss kana
Too many ads
Outdated gacha mechanics for a very successful game; I cant even use multiple devices to use 1 account. Game is hard carried by the fate ip.
"App constantly crashes within 5 seconds regardless of what you do, even at the main menu swapping between enhancements and shop tabs; during summoning; during combat; during cutscenes; changing game options; Extremely frustrating and virtually impossible to play. Support is generic and hopelessly useless."
"Too slow, no auto play features"
The audio hitches
"Hello Fgo devs, in these recent updates it seems that whenever I go to the summon menu it keeps crashing ü•≤ (since the start of the van Gogh event). Pls fix i haven't been summoning these past days ü•≤."
"I've been playing this game since it's NA release & now that the bug is fixed I decided to leave a review. This game is the It Girl. FGO had set the precedence for every other gacha game that has since been released. The story is nonsensical at times but also genuinely good & it still has some of the best character designs of any gacha game due to its sheer variety. It's casual and non-competitive, SSRs aren't required. Lower rarities can do just as well."
"Game is fairly fun, but ridiculously prefatory with micro transactions. It was fun, I dropped every gotcha I saved up over a month of playing in a banner and was 10 shy of the pity. This game is crazy expensive, I'm going back to Genshin."
"I feel hated. Four times or so, I've rolled on a Nero (Caster) banner, and every single time- Whether my SQ/Ticket count is in the hundreds or thousands, I consistently roll every Servant and CE in the game aside from her. Gold CE, Gold CE, Gold CE, Gold CE, Gold CE, and when I'm down to my last pull: Rainbow? A Servant! CASTER?!! Nursery Rhyme. I can't anymore."
I would give it a 5 star but after I updated it I can't play it please fix it
It's an interesting game to play on your phone I have MOTOROLA
This is a really fun game and i love the anime
Titis
Sigh
Love the art work
"The game is great but I have a lot of complaints about it. First and the most annoying is the loading screen every time you do a certain tasks the game loads and not just any regular loading, it take to long for the game to proceed to the next task. Second it doesn't have any sync account like Google play games or Gmail it's hard to recover your progress when your data is lost. Next is the summoning of servants, it's really hard to get 1 SSR class servant the game really gives you a low chance."
I hate reset in this game on certain time it will kick you to the main menu.
Unplayable. Game tells me to update to play but app store won't even install update
"It's not p2w it is kinda f2p but you don't need SSR servants to clear challenges, some low rarity servants actually outshine SSR servants. Stories are decent, character development is good I love some of the characters. Game isn't too hard once you understand the mechanics and don't waste resources. Pull rates are bad and censorship is weird, for example Emiya had his skin color changed to a lighter tone for us while JP has him in his original skin tone."
I tried to download the app again cuz I felt like playing again but it said i couldn't cuz i needed 1500 pb i don't know what that is but I don't think it should be saying that.
Very nice and simple Game to play. No need to rush through it. It does lag a bit at times but overall very fun and not an overwhelming experience like in many games out there.
"11/20 - 22: Keeps crashing after an update. 11/24: Recent update or ""fix"" deemed the game unplayable ""connection to server lost"" prompts every time I open it."
I can't seem to log into the game it keeping me on the black loading after the update the game really needs a fixing up.
Awesome!!! Love this game!!!
User experience is a bit better since my last review.
I've been a fate fan for a while and I've been wanting to become a master and go on an adventure with my servant and this game fulfills it and I'm playing it everyday not missing a single log-in streak
Gacha and gameplay are completely hell but still playing it..I guess I'm Masochist and Waifu lover..The game story is probably the best gacha games story ever.. That's all I gonna say
Trash dead game
"Great story and characters. Gatcha may be a bit bad, but game not forcd you to pay anthing."
Started to ego my luck Stayed because im hopelessly addicted Help Also the game is honestly not that rewarding for paying so as a f2p it is juts fine!
I need more sq give me more
Lots of gacha
Summonable Goetia when?
"It's a good game with interesting mechanics, but it has some pretty common issues here and there, as well as notoriously bad rates. Very hard for me to justify giving anything above a 4 star, but the quality of the game is definitely not worthy of anything below a 3 star."
Crashes 24/7 can't play at all. Will remove the 1 star review after it gets fixed.
I can't even login. It's just a white screen after the Start screen.
ÊúÄÈ´ò‚ÄºÔ∏èÔºÅ
Amazing game if you like the fate franchise
Tite
Good waifus. Saber best girrl.
Game is great. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and the story and events are interesting and fun. This 1 star is due to a current issue on Android S20 series that causes it to frequently crash during loading a during gameplay. Normally it occurs once a week but itd occured a dozen times today alone. Once it is fixed this review will be updated. Updates seem to have fixed the crashing issue
"Immensely satisfying in a lot of different ways, it's been very hard to stop playing... until the game started to make time gating a real problem. I'm itching to play more of this game, but it won't let me without some irresponsible use of resources. Really cruel. Hasn't changed my desire to play for a second."
Fun Game
This game is a trash fire with the worst boss design I've ever seen.
"Bruh cmon 2022, for something that needs to farm repeatedly still no auto or sweeps???"
I have enjoyed this game for awhile until it started crashing on me again when I reach the summoning screen I really thought we were past this.
It's Fate so it's automatically 5* for me
Crashes need to be fixed
This is Great game but the Gacha system is low which makes the game extra challenging don't know why other players doesn't understand the concept of grinding for materials and saint quartz because that is the essence of this game
Issues have been fixed
A good game with graphics story character design and development with good turn based comebat with a beautiful fanbase
"Entertaining, especially if you're into the anime."
This game chang
My favourite game that introduced me to gacha. After more than 5 years of playtime it still holds up as one of the best gacha's out there.
Been playing for over a year only have 4 legendary toons and one of them I spent over 500 bucks to get. The drops are way to rare even with it doubled. The only thing good is the story.
Since the recent update the game is unplayable in 64bit emulators as the app instantly crashes upon clicking to open the game. Hoping this gets fixed really soon.
Great customer support
"Overall good game, drops are not great but if u save and participate in all the weekly stuff u should be fine"
Jalter's best girl!!!
The game was doing great till I got to lost by number 4 and I defeated the doctor then God Arjuna shows up and none of my characters can take a single point of damage from him and he wipes my whole group out with a single shot so now I'm stuck moving forward if it wasn't for that I would give a 5
"Love it. FYI is my fave game right now, I just got shishou. Edit: 2022 still playing and still loving the game"
More Tamamo alts
Endless loop of connection issues and cache removal. Reinstall did not fix. Effectively lost a three year old account.
"Had this game for about 3-4 years now and still going strong!üí™ The game works wonders! No issues, no bugs, no glitches! You guys are awesome! Plus I love the fate/stay series in general!üòä‚úåÔ∏è"
"I can't recover my account, I've sent several emails to them but they stopped answering my emails"
"With sped up game play and claim all mechanic, you more or less cut half of the cumbersome farming and fighting. Though the game along the story is good, these redundant cycle for materials is disgustingly mind numbing though."
The game works again
Would be great if they would put in sync acct feature
"If you want you experience an Awful horrible Gacha experience, then play this game."
AMAZING STORY and characters it is the main reason i played fgo i love its lore and story no problems in the game play so it deserve a 5 star for me
"Very good game, fun mechanics and amazing characters. The only gripe I have is the price increase for saint quartz which occured due to the Apple price change. It may be possible to provide different versions so android users don't get punished for Apple's greed. Also, maybe tweak the pity system to be a bit more forgiving. Say like 200 pulls instead of 300."
wer quars
Ever time the game updates it makes my character start over from the beginning and my data transfer doesn't work
this game it's fun and entertaining but has a pretty unforgiving gacha system compared to other games
"Loving this game for almost 6 months, loving their character designs and the plot"
Nice game. Tho need to up the rng of gacha.
"An amazing game if you give it a chance and stick with it for a while. I played for the servants, and stayed for the story!"
If i get castoria il give 5star Ps. I got her hehehehehe
Kama bokep
The new update is still making the app crash constantly
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏±‡∏Å ;___;
"The gacha is not that bad and the game is very free to play, you can practically beat the game with the characters that you get in the friend points gacha and a good strategy. Also, the game doesn't have pvp, so you don't need to get a lot of copies of a character if you want. The design of characters are awesome and the voice actors are top tier. The story is probably one of the most epic and emotional that I've ever read in any game, specially from the sixth singularity onwards."
"The rates of this gacha is low as hell even for other gachas the whole craft essences is the dumbest thing ever you need to make it 4‚≠ê or above character guaranteed because it's hard to get the what ever there called star things to do summons with no wonder people don't playt his game the whole rates are abysmol also I don't know why the maker of this game in franchise loves females so much like every single thing in this game is a female, males don't exist"
New update had me staring at a white screen. Literally unplayable with all the bugs that remained unfixed
Game nya bosenin
it's fun
Long ago i played this game and i recently came to give it a try again unfortunately it caused screen flickering and and booted me out of the game cant even get pass tutorial please fix this.
The gameplay is among the worst I have experienced in any gacha games. It is absurd that in a such a grind heavy game each time if you farm anything you have to do everything manually. The gacha rate is absolutely horrible and the later part of the game including the story chapters(the only saving grace of the game from my perspective)are unfriendly and unforgiving if you don't have good units leveled to a high level as it force supports on you. & they don't care about their player base at all.
"O jogo √© bom, tanto graficamente, quanto em gameplay e hist√≥ria, mas o gacha √© terr√≠vel, espero que a pr√≥xima atualiza√ß√£o n√£o traga mais bugs pesados ao jogo."
Incredibly gross and predatory gacha game
This game is amazing though the saving method of the game is kinda irritating cause my phone was stolen and i forget to issue a transfer code and now my account is gone simple and for the recent updates it kicks me out of the game and turn white screen after i log in once again please fix this and please return my old account because of the recent update i cannot enter and i uninstall it and i install it once again but it restart from the beggining
really great game. love it. but BUT too many conection errors its destroing the game and fun. pls fix it :l
all i can say is it's my fav gacha so far even though it crashes some times but it's the best
My favorite game so far and its so addicting especially the gacha
Kannst
Amazing would recommend to friends also wish they would bring in mythical creatures as a class like Fenrir
Awesome üéÆ game üéÆ thank you.
Yo I just wanted to say the ui is decent simple is hard
"Great story but gameplay wise it's old and dated, it specially shows when compared to newer games. Still at this point after all this years I'm hooked and I'll keep playing till the end which from what I can see on the JP side it still has a long way. So basically I recommend it for the story, even the events are pretty interesting. It's not really pay to win since you can create strong teams with the 3 and even 2 stars servants so spending money on it is just too get your waifu."
so good
"Fun to play, the Servants are amazing, and while I was kinda bored at the very start the difficulty actually builds rapidly so you have to stop and work to progress, which is nice. But it also gives me lots of issues. The app lags constantly, and the last couple days I haven't been able to even open it. It gives me a notice about game not launching correctly & maybe clearing the cache will help, but I select it & nope. I even cleared the cache myself, restarted my phone, uninstalled & redownload"
I'm in gacha hell and I like it. But fr this game really is addictive because of the farming system and really well written dialogues what a great game indeed
"Terrible gameplay, dreadful gacha, love it."
Great game but please make it where you can google play transfer i got a new phone and lost all my data
This game is fine when it's running but it tends to constantly freeze every now and then. Is this only an issue that happens on android? Hopefully this issue is fixed soon.
"Strategy RPG with gacha mechanics based around a series I enjoy a lot. The storylines have a steadily increase in quality the longer you play exceptions being the events and Part 1.5 and it's best to consider a visual novel with a game attached to it. If gacha doesn't interest you, the gameplay, story, & lore might hook you into it. The in-game currency is easy to get early on. You'll rely heavily on events if you don't plan to pay for it though with an occasional pay to roll event twice a year"
"Biggest issue? Drop rates. While a new spin on lower level units still having function in the game, and the idea of investing into them to be on par with some of the higher ends... the prospect of a 1% drop for a 5* and 3/4% for a 4*... is both disheartening and a huge potential cash sink for those needing a key unit for end game. Hard to keep playing this game if you keep wasting Quartz on such ridiculous odds, and getting nothing from it."
"Don't know why this game cannot be played on Wi-Fi connection that needs to be fixed, Every game is played on Wi-Fi if that's the problem then I am going to stop playing this game."
Huge fan of fate after playing before playing this and after awesome animation and sprites not to mention enthralling story and lore 5 out of 5
"Too much text and decorations on a small screen makes the UI feel very crammed. Loved the idea of the game, but execution feels lacking and honestly a bit old-fashioned"
I've downloaded this game and deleted it within an hour I'm wondering why the creators of the game in the review section see all these complaints and are not responding to these people's post or comments and then when you download the game there's more to download taking up space calls you not to be able to have enough space for other games that you also create I think you need the band this game because it's wastes people time and causes glitches and issues with the device that we are using....
game not meant for. no auto mode makes doing easy stages boring for me. lots of loading times as well. dont like the character designs also.
PAIN
Lame
Addicted
Story receive top mark wish some character appear but some servant need buff hope buff keep coming enjoying story cant wait lostbelt 6
It's a good game
"This game is an immense and surprisingly deep story, told out over the course of paired visual novel storytelling and turn based RPG combat. Servants are numerous, with something for almost everybody out there. They come in a white variety of visual designs, play styles, builds, and power levels--but investment can make anybody work using. It also has some of the best art and music on mobile. The game is in A, but once the story hits Camelot, that becomes an easy A+ and stays there."
Crashes on my android just recently every time upon startup. I've tried clearing cache and data but it it still crashes upon startup even after restarting my phone. Other gachas have not had any issues so it's definitely just issues with this app. Hopefully I can come back to FGO eventually but for now I'm uninstalling it after I've been playing for years...
"Haven't been able to play in 12 days cause of the white screen bug that the last update was suppose to fix for others that had the issue, now with the update its passed it on to many that never had the issue to begin with and have had no word back at all to when it will be fixed."
"Gonna be perfectly honest, I installed for Astolfo and possibly Neco Arc"
"No crashing on my end, still runs smoothly. Galaxy S10. It has to be a case by case basis at this point, so weird"
"I've played this game for almost a year, its pretty great, with the exception of no auto clear, or QOL features like it, but recently i got a phone wich i had to restore to fabric state, it had my old account, and now it says my account is already logged in, so it doesnt let me log in again :/"
It's a waifu collection game with an RPG system and a pretty entertaining story attached.
Had to update my review because the game has been stuck on a white screen for days since the last update and you wont do anything about it
"The game can't even load ingame becuase of wifi even there is no problem. It happened during Imaginary Scramble update, currently unplayable it says ""Application did not launch properly"" the problem is the game itself"
It's salty but I like it.
Story is great but out of all the gacha games I played this one is by far the worst one. I used over 300 saint crystals to try and get 1 5 star servent and only got a lot of 5 star craft essence and only 3 star servants. It woldent be that bad if grinding for SQ wasn't so boring. And purchaseing SQ from the shop is way to expensive just to get 42SQ is $40. This game just feels like a cash grab. I'm done with it and I'm telling my friends to never play this game.
Waiting 10 minutes with a black screen just to summon with the tutorial. That's a little rediculious
"it's a great game. However, the gacha rates just kinda throws me off."
"Great game, they give you lots of summoning chances over time but the odds and cost of buying more are ridiculous. I've had so much bad luck in rolls that it spoils the game a fair bit but the story is good and gameplay has lots of events and fun stuff. Just too bad you can literally spend hundreds of pounds and not get what you want. That is just greed by developer"
"Are you not familiar with Fate franchise? This is your chance. Skip it, it's just a populace of stockholm syndrome."
"I love fate anime. Thats why i downloaded this game. this game is good, Gatcha system is ok even if you are free to play, and they have events which is exciting for players and they give free servants. BUT my only problem is the loading time, it takes 1:30 to 2 minutes starting battles, 30sec to 1 min after battles. Sometimes even longer than thatI Its only a matter of time to become completely bored of this game because of this loading. If only they can speed up that loading time."
"The game itself is solid, what brings it down is the absolutely appalling chance of a 5*, do not spend money on this ever."
Please do a rate up for mysterious heroine x alter berserker.
"I play FGO for its story/writing. It's not all perfect, but the lore and depth of character and level design are great, especially later on. The gameplay requires at least a basic understanding of mechanics at times to mastery of every gimmick for the hardest challenges. The gacha aspect is pretty harsh, but friend supports and rewards make up for it. The entire game can be beat with only free units if you want to play that way. The waifu-to-husbando ratio is pretty balanced as well."
I really enjoyed this game for 4 days. That's when a new update came out that made me unable to get through the title screen. All I get is a white screen.
Been playing this game for 5 years now. I'm still hooked on it.
I just love the characters in game and the event story's to I just love this game
"Uninstalled as soon as I noticed you can't skip the summoning animations which take far too damn long, just let me skip to the results screen"
Issue I had had been fixed it is now possible for me to summon
"This game is so cool and Interactive. I keep starting over due to it never saving my information, but i still love this game and the many great animes it came from. P.S can we have a Madoka Magica collab plsssss"
They fixed the crashing... I think with the update today.... And i lucked out and got Frankenstein saber... I know now they are paying attention
Humbaba
I love the game thank you devs for fixing the issue I no longer have the issue thx so much üòÅ
"It was really fun to play, but after a while it got laggy and the game said that reinstalling or clearing the cache would help remove the lag issue. I redownloaded the game and all the progress was lost, and since the email form for restore is so tedious and confusing to me, i cant really attempt a restore. I had a lot of important progress lost now, so now im just going to delete the game forever."
"The story is always a pleasure to experience, however the game play loop is a bit dated but with how fast this new company is pumping out qol updates I'm optimistic about this games future"
"Not able to login for a week now, customer service is incredibly slow in replying"
It used to run really well but now keeps crashing it just took 30 quarts from me to do a summoning and crashed before it finished so I just lost all that/ so I don't know if the problem is fix after the update but just gave 4 quarts as a apology I guess
"Loved this game, now every second time I open it it'll crash, hang, or have some sort of error. most recent update simply has the game stuck on a white screen. this needs to be fixed"
"Great game that I've had a lot of fun playing. Be mindful if you switch devices, you REALLY need that transfer code. I lost my entire account so I am starting over."
Enjoy this game spent plenty of my time grinding resources had several issues recently but with latest patch they seemed to fix the problem
Everything works well now and can summon
We wanted event but what we got was a white/black screen
White screen. Cannot login to my account since last update.
Stuck on a white screen after the main title menu.
"Got NP2 Castoria in a single multi-pull, best thing I've ever had since playing the game Edit: And guess what, NP3 Yang Guifei all under 300 quartz. FGO never fails to amaze me"
"Game broke with the latest patch. Stuck in the white screen This has been such a huge issue, do we get any compensation? Especially since we're missing an event with stuff that we know will never get back?"
Latest update added a bunch of solid quality of life changes and optimizations that the game sorely needed.
"Tbh since the update dropped, the game started to crash alot. 4 stars"
"I really enjoy this game, but at this point I'm about to be forced to give it up do to how much space it's taking from my phone, I had to delete all my other nonessential apps to update so I could continue to play. And now I can't even connect, just instantly hits a failed to connect screen after the initial logo.... Still can't get back in, even after foolishly reinstalling the app, but I did have my Code saved, so as long as you guys don't delete my account, I'll be back eventually."
Many bugs in the game please fix
"The game itself is nice, but the localization team is awful (as in they rewrote certain sections 'because they know better' as they put it) and it feels like they aren't even trying to keep their player base, putting the bare minimum effort in everything they have to do. This also translates in updates breaking the game on many devices (who needs tests on a game that rakes in millions, right?), terrible communication and the likes. Great IP, great writer, great art, terrible everything else."
Great game but after playing for 2 days the Game wont Load in to tge Start up it will only be stuck on a White Screen please Fix this...
Good game with beautiful art and fun game play. Unfortunately there is currently a glitch that crashes the game when I get tothe summon screen so hopefully that gets fixed. Besides that still an enjoyable game that I would recommend
Walang kwenta
When are you guys going to fix the white screen only?
"A fantastic game, trully worth it!"
Yawa
"My friend got me into fate, the game itself is nothing special but nothing beats the feeling of pulling an ssr from one summon ticket."
I can't summon can you please fix that it kicks me out it is sad because I enjoy Fate/series but can't no new servants and free summing.
"I gave up. If you love/d this game, it will find a way to drag you back. Unless you've spent an unreasonable amount of time and money on this game and quit, the game's going to find a way to drag you back."
Garbage rates
"Although the gameplay itself can become tedious, I believe the story and characters can make up for it. 3 star characters are able to clear challenging bosses yet there is still an element of p2w meta characters typical in gacha games. Anyway, Oberon solos."
"Latest update has made summoing impossible for me and several others, while the supposed update to fix it did not fix it."
Still crashes way too often and I just recently fought a level 48 Lancer and he managed to defeat most of my servants who were all level 70
"Frequent freezing in menus and battles on many Samsung devices for months. Problems have been known, developers have done nothing."
Smile happy yaaaaaaaaay no big novi so sad not happy copage bwahahahhwhe
"Lots of fun, pain, and happiness all bunched into game play and gacha. I hope this game never ends"
Update fix when?
Pathetic. Main event quest won't even load. How am I supposed to play it much less finish it?
Bad optimization.
The game is unplayable right now because of that white screen bug
It often freezes and crasges
"L mo loo ll look up Mm j BB l L LLl pa Mom LL. Loo oo lol I in Illuminati fun ba mm .. Mom Mm mk me. I miss pa l LL..,.,oklm as loo people L"
"The game is great, but my main concern is that whenever i am about to play, it just gets stuck at the white screen, hoping you guys fix this soon."
I CANT LOG IN or enter the game the whole screen is white when i just open the game i dont wanna re install the game just to play it
I enjoyed it but when the game need to be updated I suddenly lost my account and can't recover it even using the transfer code or clearing cache. It's the second time it happened and I just lost interest because it's feels like waste of time.
"Been playing this game since launch year and I see no problems at all, it has a good story, amazing art, superb voice actors, and is very fun to play üëå"
"Loved this game for years and spent a couple hundred on it. But after some updates, a few months ago, it has been constantly crashing - making it nigh unplayable! It worked well for years and then just stopped working... So although I would love to give it a 5... at this point, as I cannot play it, I have to give it a 1. --- (Edit: Bug fixes seem to have been fixed so I am putting this back at 5 again! ^^)"
If you realy have courage to play this thats means you accept the low drop rate
The game is good and fun to play but after it updated the summon scene gets glitchy and blinks then got stock I really like this game please fix it
"I like the game, Idk why people don't like it, I'm changing my review because it keep crushing even tho I have 13GB, and it keep freezing üò°üò°üò°"
RATE UP IS A LIE!
"26 ‚Ç¨ more for the Saint Quarts Pack (almost 40 %), for no real reason other than to keep up with apple store... not even increasing the Saint quarts amount for your packs. Thats just not ok to f** over your whole EU playerbase like this lasagna (even more so with everything escalating in EU atm). If you would have adjusted the prices like you did over in Japan it would be fine for most people, but this is just been greedy now. You will lose out more, then you gain with making packs so expensive."
"There are more rewarding gacha games out there but this game's story is top tier (except American Singularity I guess, who even wrote that)"
"Enjoyable Plot,CUTE WAIFUS and ofcourse GACHAWHAWAHAWH"
"Looks like the crashing problems on Android has been fixed, and with the new update came a lot of QOL changes. Hopefully we don't get any problems like that anytime soon, and the game can get back to being fun."
"after so many update that coming one by one, the game is becoming more unplayable, it's so laggy even tho my connection is working properly, the game crashes every time i use the NP of First Hassan and the game also crashes after a certain cutscenes showing on my screen which is really annoying since it restart my game everytime it crashes, im not patient enough to wait and stare unto my screen just to crashes again"
Drop rate sucks
Still getting constant graphical glitches and game crashes even after the most recent update. I really hope they address this soon.
"Great game but it got ruined by constant crashes and bugs at first I couldn't go to the summon page, next as i was leveling up a servant it crashed, after going to my room it crashes and finally the news page after not pressing anything guess? It crashes i hope this error gets fixed in the next update or.. soon"
"Man after this update (2.38) my game received crash after crash I can't even open the gacha anymore. Recently I even barely can farm and I don't think my phone can handle FGO. I thought this update will help low spec phones but instead did the opposite. I love FGO and Fate franchise in general and this never once happened to me before, I hope the game will sooner because I can't really stand this constantly game crushes."
"Been playing for a couple years, no issues but suddenly it crashes every single time I try to visit the summon banners. Nothing seems to have fixed it."
"Cant enter the game anymore due to white screen, even if i follow the guides of other people like deleting my cache or chaning my phone language to US"
It is crashed
Edited the review again as the crashing appears to have subsided.
Great game but with this new update the game has been crashing more recently as of late
The game keeps on crashing and I've tried everything in my power to try to fix the problem but it keeps on happening more and more with every update.
Fix the crashes and feezes already man
Need to be able to save to Google account without code
The update made the game unplayable... i cant do anything its slow its crashes i cant summon gacha which isnt fair bc i missed like 3 days of summon rate ups
Money go bye-bye :)
"The story is great, especially if you're a fan of Fate series (or TYPE-MOON games). The gameplay is repetitive though (different gameplay only on events). Rarely crashed, but often lagged. The Gacha is harsher than other games but it doesn't mean this game is P2W. You can win using low rarity Servants (equivalent of character)."
I like this cause I got lucky and got 3 SSR herosü§©
I actually don't want to change my ratings because I love this game ever since I started but now that the updates are coming one by one I really have to say this now. The game is fricking unplayable right now it constantly pauses whenever i try to touch the screen and every fights and story scenes are fricking lagging can't even play the game without it pausing every 5 seconds. I really hope you start fixing this problem cause I really love the game and please dont force me to buy another phone.
Really good but pretty laggy
üî•üëëüî•
"There seems to be a problem with the new update since it messes with my phone, it being an android. Please fix this as fast as possible!"
"I love this game, but it never performed well on my Galaxy A11, combat was regularly full of lag. Latest update has fixed gameplay lag on my phone, but now crashes every time I try to access the gacha menu. Obviously a problem for a game that exists to sell gacha currency. Any chance this can be fixed before MHXX returns to single rate up?"
"Whoever optimized this latest update is trash. I went from running the game fine to bring unable to summon, unable to access my shards page without crashing, unable to even go through a whole Gilgamesh archer Np without crashing, and a buggy mess this week."
"Exceptional game!! Love everything about it... except for the fact that I currently can't access the Summons... other than that, the art style and voice acting are all on point!!"
The game crashes when I try to go to the summon screen. I've tried clearing the cache but that fixes nothing.
"Lags ap√≥s update, errors ap√≥s a battle finish"
Liz Love
Im excited for the new event then the update finished when i open the game i got endless white screen pls fix this game devs thankyou
"Hi team, after the update, I only can see the blank screen after login, tried to clear the cache and reinstall the game, did not resolve the issues, please help. I am using Samsung fold 4"
Pls fix rolls it's crashing when opening it
"Pessoal que est√° com o bug da tela branca, para conseguir entrar a linguagem padr√£o do seu celular deve estar em English (US). E por favor arrumem isso logo"
The recent update has made the game unplayable atm as I get stuck on an endless white screen when I press start on the menu. Please fix this.
since the new update come I always stuck in title screen but I still can play jp version on my phone pls fix the problem
"I love the part where (x) said ""It's (x)ing time."" and (x)ed all over the bad guys. Truly the mobile game of all time. Bravo, Nasu and Takeuchi!"
"I'm playing this game for a year and a half, and so far I'm enjoying events and main quests, but after the recent update the game became too much laggy specially when playing the event and rolling from the gacha, and this is my first experience that the game actually frequently crashing, I can't even choose the ""low resolution"" setting for some reason. Please fix it ASAP I really need to summon Van Gogh so please:("
"Game keeps crashing on android on multiple different phones, only a recent issue but makes the game unplayable, have been stuck on menu screens since the last update."
Love the game but I can't do much beyond log in since the 200MB update. It has been crashing ever since. I should have plenty of RAM and memory for it to work properly but it won't. Please help! I love this game!
This Game is a masterpiece but
"Game is fun enough, but the last few updates have consistently ratcheted up the crashes, with the latest being to the point where every attempt to get past the title screen is met with an immediate crash. Reinstall did not help at all, so now I'm stuck and can't even access the transfer code setup feature to try and move my account to a new device."
"There are plenty of good low rarity servants which have fun playstyles, so even without a lot of 5 stars you will have a good time and be able to clear content. The story is pretty good too, and it's a very fun game overall. Part 2 is even better than most of part 1. Recomended to Fate fans, and for those new to the series it's a nice hook. Only complaint is occasional errors when certain updates occur and the game crashes, but it is currently working."
Fate grand order english when i update finish update it say error come on
"Latest update made the crashes even worse. Can't even see the summoning, news, enhancment, event map; etc without constantly having to relaunch the app. Don't even get me started on the battles and using NP. Wish I can post screenshots of this on here."
I love it I love the art I love the story I love the concept the voice actors are great the animation is awesome it's just so good!
Fantastic. Fell in love with a character from it. Guess who.
It always crashes on the new update
"The game is fun, but recently the game has been crashing anytime I want to open the summon banners on the Galaxy A10e."
Why is summon don't let me in this is stupid. I am deleted this dumb appüò†üëéüëéüëéüíî
This is a great game but it will be better if it don't crack every time I click in summon. Pls fix it as fast as you can so i can summon for van Gogh.
"New event broke the game for me, as soon as I try to summon it goes black then crashes,. Did this 4 times in a row so it wasn't just a random crash."
pity
"The experience is great, the mechanics is interesting. But the sync account is the problem, this game has no sync account like any other gacha games but they have game transfer. I have experience a bug that after entering the main menu of the game the screen turns to white screen, the solution is to reinstall or clear data. Wasted all my time grinding and playing, I even pulled Altoria and Mordred in my first 10. I hope they develop a sync account on social media like Pricone."
"This game is good when you can actually play it. I was lucky of thinking ahead of time and transferred my account to my old iPad. That transfer was over a month ago. Before the transfer it crashed a few times but at least I was about to do something in the game, now it won't even get to the start screen and gives me the option to either restart, retry or clear cache. Extremely disappointed how it takes forever to get any patches that actually fixes the game and not add content."
Thanks for the fix!
Constant crashing
"Update (10/27/22): Took off another star. It has been 3 months since my last review, and I still cannot do anything in game without it crashing. Original review (07/17/22) I love this game, but I'm missing the event because the game keeps crashing!!! Please fix this before the event ends üôè"
"Feels like since around August the game gets too buggy during an event. Too much lag, crashes, or freezes. I don't know what the devs are doing, but they need to fix whatever is going on. Dropping back to 1 star, because I can't even summon right now. Yes, RIGHT NOW right now!"
White screen happened
This game has never crashed for me...It is overall the best game on my phone. The servants look really cool. I like to bond with them. I wish they would add english voices to them.
"You can barely play this right now due to crashes and other issues, which seem to get worse with each update. Even if you don't crash your game can stutter or even freeze during animations. Earlier today I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game to see if that would solve the problem (yes, I have plenty of phone storage and I made sure the game was updated) but it didn't solve the issues. Please avoid playing this mess until these issues are resolved or you'll just be wasting time."
"The story telling in the lostbelts is amazing. I only wish that you didn't have to spend more than 100 quartz to get a 5 star, sometimes you don't even get a 4 star. Getting SQ for f2p is hard enough as it is, very time consuming to farm. Gameplay has gotten better, but it can still improve more."
The gameplay is fun but the RNG and lack of pity is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Only game you can blow hundreds and never even see a gold servant.
Pretty good Fate game love that it rewards free-to-players for playing. Keep up the good work please.
"Story has ups and downs, chapters are better than others, but it's fun to play and collect the Servants. Kind of obsessed with it."
New update has me stuck on a white screen even after clearing cache üéâüéâüéâ
"What the frick is happening i cannot log in to the game, like it is stuck on a white screen after clicking the two start screens!"
"Anyone else on the Canadian server having troubles getting into the Summoning menu? My game simply shuts down. Annoying, as I just spent money on SQ and this wasn't an issue prior to the newest update. Please fix. Much love, keep up good work."
I got this game a week ago sometime around the Nightingale Christmas carol 2021 re-run event I had a fun time playing this game but recently because of the new updates I need to turn on my mobile data in order to play on the game and now because of the new update I can't even get on the game without it saying the games server is busy. No matter what I do clear the data or uninstalling and reinstalling the game is always says the game server is busy even with my mobile data turned on.
"Gotta love rolling 5 different 5 star craft essences and 17 different 4 star craft essences on a character banner Not sure about ya'll, but I love being limited to only 3 star characters because the gacha system wont even give me a 4 star :)"
No longer working at all white screen after the hero intro page only occured after todays patch
SABER AWOOOOOGAüòçüòçüòç
After the new update it doesn't let me join the game itself
I cant continue with Lb5 anymore. Every update it keeps crashing. Cant do events or anything. This really feels hopeless.
"After the new update, game is running so smooth! Thank you for fixing the game."
Goated but fix the crashes pls since the update from like few weeks pls
"I love fate, it's a great series and the stories this app presents are great and have given me some of my favorite characters in the franchise. But the issues lay with the apps performance, crashes constantly, lags like crazy and it just makes playing it so difficult. I can deal with these issues and continue to play the game that I enjoy but I would love to see this game get better in the near future."
"In the last update you added a lot of quality of lide, but you forgot about optimization, my game now doesn't open anymore!"
"After the update, I could not log-in anymore. I am stuck on a white screen. WTH happened?"
"I've seen other people talking about crashes, but they've definitely fixed it from my perspective. The game runs great and is super engaging."
Too much crashes. Absurd rise in the price of qp
"Finally in the App store in Germany, I can update easier now. My NA account is still available and I love it, now after 2years of forced f2p, I still cannot buy quartz and give up hope to max. Np my Husbandos Gilgamesh and Arthur. Extremely bad gacha rates, I do not recommend spending money on this. There is no guranteed or anything. Great story 9/10, would pay for more Rin faces. Not for Artoria/Saber faces thou, there is way too many of them."
After the update for imaginary scramble the app force close after a couple of minutes when doing the event and it also force close when trying to go to the summoning screen..i find it funny that i could play honkai 3rd impact but can't properly play fgo...
"It is a cute time killer with a really predatory gatcha system. The story is cringe at the start but gets better, the gameplay is pretty fun, and there are 1-2 events monthly. The -1 star rating is for the gatcha system, in the $80 bundle (best deal) it is ~$1.50 per roll with a 1% chance at a 5*. The pity system is also trash, explained on the wiki fully, but it is horrendous (spend ~$500 bucks to reach it). Hell, i spent around 220 f2p rolls for my first 5*, it can be rough..."
"Good for og fate fans. Reaaly an old game though, play it for the characters and story."
I CANT ENTER THE GAME. Everytime I press the homescreen it takes me to a white screen and I get stuck there for long periods of time.
"FGO is a great experience. It's far from perfect, it's not the best gacha game out there (let's be real, it all depends on one's type), the gacha is truly hell, and I'd say I'm just a really lucky F2P player. Gameplay is not for everyone that's for sure. But the story really is what really pulled me in. While the early chapters were lackluster, the big picture is that I got to experience a grand adventure through an altered world history with the heroes I learned of as I grew up. Peak fiction."
"The game is fun and entertaining but it won't let me summon anymore, whenever I go to the summon tab the screen goes black and kicks me out of the game. I don't know what to do aside from uninstalling and reinstalling but I'm afraid I'll lose 2 years worth of progress."
I just need to complete last singularity to defeat demon gods easily.
"After today's update (26th-27th) the game keeps crashing everytime I try to go to the summons page, everything else works just fine, the problem is the summons."
"For some reason the app store cannot notice when the game tell it has new update. I have to restart my phone everytime new update come, just for the app store display the update option. Very annoying. Other than that, if you like Fate universe and it's story, then you are gonna like this game. The grinding is terrible though. Update: the problem which store cannot define game update is now solved. It much better now."
"No ads, impressive graphics [60 Fps], tie ins to the mangas,anime and other type moon works, and over all fun"
"Unplayable after update. Keeps crashing. Can't even go to summon screen, it keeps crashing"
The game always crash ever since the new update
Fairly good in it's gameplay mechanics and story but even if it doesn't have good gacha rate... It should've atleast have a pity count of 200-300 or something... I honestly don't know if I should recommend the game and all. It's starting to get on my nerves. I wish I could've whaled but oh well.... Hmmmmm Thank you for the Skadi Btw. Starting to get bored. Became much more boring.
Good rewards fun gams godly story and pretty much you just have to be patient on games like this and you'll get what you want from the game the recovery or the in game service is fast well they need time to verify your request from them but it's worth it to wait totally download the game right now very f2p
"Loads of bugs when loading the game. Had to delete it twice, lost all my stuff and now cant open the game. All I'm left with is a white screen after this new update. Besides the countless annoying bugs that make you lose all your stuff....its good at most. Please fix the bugs."
"I loved the app, I started playing every single day when I installed it 2 weeks. But suddenly a new update happened and now I can't play the game because it's just displays a white screen after the home menu. Like I don't know why this occured maybe the Devs didn't have the Poco f3 in mind while updating the game. Now I think I'm going to lose my account sadly. Because I can't get my transfer code since it only displays a white screen. Please fix."
"Would highly not recommend this game if you're not a fan or at least familiar with the Fate series, convoluted story, boring gameplay, and tedious grinding would turn the newcomer and casual players off this game. And even if you're a Fate fan who happens to have a particular favorite character in this game and you want it, get royally f**ked by the 0.3% gacha rate or grind and prepare 2 years worth of gacha pulls. There's a line between sanity and patience y'all, grind for 2 years is the former"
Its a very great and enjoyable game. I would definitely give it 5 stars but after the recent update i can't log in please do fix this issue.
After this most recent update I can't play it crashes at the second loading screen
Bro I hate gacha games
"This game has an amazing story. The gameplay is okay. You don't really need 5* to clear this game, only pull for a character you like."
"Since the turnover to Lasagna this game is getting better and frequently getting updates. There are flaws especially the abysmal gacha rates, but you can still play the game and complete the quests using welfare servants."
based game
Wonderful game and graphics. I recommend trying it out.
"This is for all the fate fans. Yes, Gacha is brutal, but when is it ever not? Engine might be showing its age, but let's be honest, fans of this franchise are drawn in not by the gameplay mechanics, but depth of writing in the scenarios, and how complex the characters are. May FGO live long and prosper."
"I really like the game but for some reason, after the recent update, the game keeps on crashing after a few mins. I can barely even play anymore. The error codes keep on popping up but i already followed the instructions and yet it still inevitably crashes. Please fix this issue. Before the update i didn't have any issue like this."
"Best role play storyline. Needs A Data link system, so I can link my data to my Email. So, if my cellphone gets destroyed, My data won't be erased, and my data will be safe."
I like this game the characters are cool :3
Early QoL updates. You deserve this 5 star Lasengle.
Great game. Don't be salty and enjoy the story
"For people who's on Android and keep getting crashes, go download Webview (Beta or Canary) in the appstore. Enable it and then restart your phone. Haven't had any crashes since before Himiko. Every time I update the webview I redo the enabling and restart the phone. No crashes afterwards."
Philosophy Teacher's üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
un GRAN juego
I love this game. But unfortunately it crashes and freeze a lot. Constantly.
Game crashes constantly. I can't even play it enough to actually see what's it's about.
It won't give me Jalter 5/5 stars
I can't even get through the tutorial with out it crashing and closing very Dissapointing wouldn't recommend downloading
"Game is quite decent both story and gameplays the only thing i hate about it is the gacha sytem becasue there is no pity system and source for Saint Quartz are few so if you wanna play this, pull at your own risk since you can only get like 6 per week which is not enough."
Keeps crashing after i pass title screen
"I've been playing fgo for many years and kept my mouth shut playing this game waiting months and months for Content that never came, looking at the Japanese servers and seeing how well those players are rewarded makes me sick. I wish all the best too current players but I am done waiting for content and no summoning is not considered new content when you have a wide variety of servants already at your fingertips from years of playing."
The fate series is one of my favorite anime series and me play a game from the show is simply amazing but it does lag and freeze up and the characters dont display most of the time but besides all that it's a pretty good game.
"New Update Crashes Game Every Load Screen. I've played since the NA launch, and this last update has actually made the game unplayable. Don't even attempt to install until they fix this. October 24 2022"
It's a good game. Graphics are great. Crashes have been ridiculous. I'm also constantly having problems with updates. It would tell me it needs to update the app but it already updated or there is nothing to update. I'm about to give this game up.
"Been playing for around 3 years now, I absolutely love it... if it wasn't for the constant crashing. Can barely even complete a daily quest, let alone an NP animation (most of the time I can get the daily login bonus 1/3 times) without 80 percent odds of CTD. Even got a brand new Samsung Galaxy S22, thought that might solve the problem. It was the one mobile game I sunk time and money into, until they fix it I have to give it a low rating. Had to miss big events because it was so bad at times"
"Everytime I try to start a mission, it gets stuck on the loading screen, then closes the game. I can login and summon just fine, but trying to do any missions and the game crashes. I hope it's not just me. Needs to be fixed."
If your a fan of Fate/ or any of Type-Moon's other works you should enjoy.
This game is dope
"it has easy mechanics and a great story its one of the best game ive played in mobile. It also has nice graphics especially at some noble phantasm, the community also is very helpful to each other. over all its a great game my only wish is that saint quartz would be easier to acquire and rate ups should be higher"
Game keeps crashing when trying to enter battle. Can't start playing
"Crash all the time, try to click Friend Point Pool then shut down."

It great
One of my favorite games been play for 3 years and even though 5 stars are rare you dont need them and the events are a lot of fun.
"I love the game. The artwork and the animations are a definite treat, the storyline is interesting. I can't wait for more singularities."
give some servent pls love youüòçü•∞
Can't play it ever since the latest update because it crashes so much :(
Game is so great all it does is crash
"Is this a fun, well designed game? Yes. 5 stars. Has it crashed consistently for weeks now making it literally unplayable? Also yes. 1 star. Fix this."
"As a massive FSN and FZ fan. I Love this game. Graphics, the fight system the lore and story. Nice all around. And the servants from the anime series is good to have. The Negative? RNG on gacha is as bad as the Korean base games. Forces you to spend money. And yes you can just farm Quartz for free. But farm 600 Quartz and still not get the servant you want. You even get non rate up servant spooks. It's Disheartening and makes you lose interest playing the game. Good game. Scummy devs."
"Horrible support team, wouldn't give back my account"
This don't mean I'm gay I don't like men
First problem with constant app closing during event periods was fixed but 2 months later it's happening again? For 5 minutes the app kept closing withing a minute of opening and getting through the main screen. Always seems to happened during the timed event. What's the point of having these events when you're going to have these bugs and people can't even enjoy the event? Update: new event started (not sure if it even did) and I can't even make it to the page to claim my daily rewards.
Great story but really outdated gameplay well it's a 7 year old game so that's a given.
Game is now broken by latest update. Crashea on sign in Crashes on rolling Crashes on literary anything.
"I would give it a 4 because I like the story and the gameplay, but the game keep on crashing. It was ok for like 2 weeks but now I can't even get in without it crashing. Hopefully it will get fixed."
Amazing game. But it has its glitches. But once the glitches are fixed its an amazing game. Hope the glitches get fixed soon.
Game very bruh. But 10/10 on the fanbase
True gacha hell experience
I think it would be nice if the game was more forgiving. Because it's no good to not get 4* or 5* after pulling more than 50 times
Love this game but after updating im now experiencing a crashing bug that makes the game unplayable
"Actual game and gatcha system is fun, but the servers need a lot of work. I have 1000mbs fibre internet and a Samsung S22 Ultra in New Zealand and I have to wait quite literally 5-10 minutes per cutscene. Doing a 10 pull took nearly 30 minutes waiting for characters to introduce themself and my game just refuses to load between, before and after missions."
It's all good but There's a bug that doesn't show my farmed materials
"Game needs a rework. Why hasn't there been a feature added to have battles skipped, or auto play function? I do a lot of missions that are no brainer clicks, and couldn't be bothered to see the boring content to farm material ten times over. There are other gacha games that are more convenient that haven't even been out as long."
"Impossible to play the game can open but try any activities and crashes in the loading screen. Has been fixed, occasionally freezes, but playable now"
I cant even get past the title screen its practically unplayable what is even going on
"Been playing and loving the game for 3 or 4 years now but since Lasengle came in a few months ago the game has been crashing and or freezing alot. This happens very frequently during battles, at least once on each wave."
"From a F2P PoV. This game is great. A good story, fun light events and the characters get development. I have no complain about the game itself, ofc, NA censored one of the dudes in the game, so hell will freeze over before I spend any cash in it."
Can't even play keeps crashing
hehe... sowaka sowaka
love this game. always fun to play anytime of the day. its great
"Good game, great story, Saint quartz price increase horrifying, i mean litterally disgusting, it really is shamefull."
"Game mechanics are pretty fun, but the QoL is terrible. Grinding is atrocious, events are basically repeating one battle like a hundred times. Story also freezes very frequently, so you can't even enjoy the main part of the game, may as well read it elsewhere."
"Dear Developers. I hope this message is able to reach you. Please kindly note that during gameplays, the app would crash randomly for Android devices. A friend of mine also experienced similar issues, and hope that future patches can resolve it. Kindly note of the devices involved. Samsung S20(not FE), and Samsung S22 Ultra. Thank you."
"Can't play the game keeps on crashing, even tried uninstalling and installing again to see uf that would work nope"
"Excellent Game, Good graphic and everything"
The game won't get out of the black screen before it loads to servent back story before it gets to title screen
Lame png game
"Unstable game is unstable.. Heard about this game, decided to try... I cannot do the intro fight because it constantly crashes."
Jeu excellent
It's a bit fun if it's not too loading and stops every time i summon a Hero it always stops for few minutes or even an hour that's why i keep closing the game and opening it again
"When it works it's great. This past week I can get my daily rewards but it crashes when I try to do anything else. It happened about a month ago too. Was hoping to get the event cleared, but now I don't think I will. I understand updates, but these issues make me not want to play anymore. My brother plays it as well and has not had any of the problems I have been having."
The game is constantly crashing! I have to reopen the game 4 to 5 time to finish a level. Alot of other times I just can't finish a level all together. Pleas fix this.
"The game won't even start, the icon in the app drawer even changed and when itry from the play store nothing happens. I don't wanna install in fear of losing my account that I've had for awhile."
"I love this game. My boyfriend introduced me to the series and I've been hooked ever since. Don't listen to the complainers all you gotta do is grind and have trust in the process. Really, grinding is all you need to do if you're up to it. Takes A LOT of phone space so don't get it if you don't have enough gigs. GREAT GAME!"
Latest update made the game literally unplayable. It crashes after every battle sequence and then resets. Contacted developer and the reply basically stated that there was no fix coming until November at the earliest. Can't farm in a game that is built around farming for materials so it's basically an anime app. Been playing since launch and cannot express how unplayable the game is now.
"The game is crashing constantly. In battles, the game crashes out of nowhere and I have to reload. Even when I am just organizing my party it crashes constantly. It is very annoying."
"Game constantly crashes after the Gudaguda Yamataikoku event. At first the crashes were few and far between but they've gotten worse and worse over the weeks. Now it's actually impossible to play the Christmas 2021 rerun since the app always crashes when I try to log in. If I'm lucky enough to select a quest, it either freezes in the loading menu or crashes as soon as the battle loads. I don't know what happened, but Lasengle needs to fix it ASAP."
I give it 5 star
downloaded the app so i can rate it 1 star for no reason
Constantly crashes I've uninstalled and reinstalled
"No other options to save game data other than the give id. I have lost 3 accounts just to play again hopefully you guys add other options to link save data like Facebook, Google play, or fgo account or something because the id from settings just doesn't work and its less stressing and confusing for new players to save they're accounts. Hopefully you guys solve this problem because i and other people would appreciate it thanks."
Its nice... Stayed for the characters and story.
Pain and suffering has led me to obtaining my waifu. It was worth it
Game will crash right after support screen and I can not play any quests.
Epico
It's all about the characters and waifus and both are grate.
"Crash, crash, crash, crash... This game is almost over for me."
"The more you play, the more this game gets boring."
EX luck please
Game suddenly started crashing all of a sudden even though phone is high end hope there's a fix for this
"I'd originally downloaded this game just because FGO's C√∫ Chulainn was a character I'd seen around a lot and eventually came to love while barely knowing anything about him or the Fate series. This game has gotten its grubby little hands on me and now I am completely in it all, unfortunately. Still waiting for the day I get C√∫ Chulainn Alter. Yes, he is still my favorite character. Also the beginner's luck thing this game has got going on for itself is CRAZY."
No need
I literally cannot even play the game since it keeps on telling me that I need to redownload the game data and clear the cache but it doesn't work for me. I've done it several times already. I had a bunch of progress already and ill prolly lose it.
lol @ that price increase
This will be more good if they add pvp or public chat
"Since last update, game keep crashing. Please fix it."
This game was really great but not after an update all it does is freezes and kicks me out of the app not playable!!!!
My game has been crashing alot latly but still a really fun game
GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA
Loading update was too slow
Trash asf gacha system spent 190 saint quarts and 45 single pulls coudnt even get a 5 star servant trash asf.
"Really wish they implemented a account bind setup, that way i wouldn't have lost all of my damn resource I had saved. I mean why is that not an option, that is literally key setting to have for gacha games."
Scamer
Crashing after update
Straight up unplayable for me after the update. Crashes everytime I try to play.
SQ price increase is just outrageous. Giving this the deserving 1 star until this is fixed.
big gamer game bro
The game is nice but please stop showing there private body too much in the ads it's disgusting
I lose my first acc because I change phone but still good in my second acc
sucks
"I've been playing and paying in this game for quite a while, and the last update actually decided to make me write a review. The problem is the reason, 35% increase in price for no increase of quartz is simply a scam. So the result is simple honestly: me giving a 1 star review and going F2P from now on. Not much else to add really."
The game and the story are amazing but the game basically crashes every 5 min. It becomes annoying and unplayable. Please do something about this otherwise you're gonna lose your player base.
"I've been playing and enjoying the story, but there have been lots of problems. Haven't been able to play for days. Game crashes on battles/infinite loading screen. New update seems to have made it worse. Tried refreshing game data 3 times. Even tried reinstalling which I found out means I have lost my account."
"The new Saint Quartz update is a disgusting breach of trust. People in europe are being punished due to Apple increasing their monetization, even if you use Android. The least Lasengle could do is to match the increased price with increased amounts of SQ, but no they just want to be greedy little rats."
This game is great (though extremely p2w). It is playable as a f2p which is slightly refreshing though there seems to be an issue when using noble phantasm or generally playing as it crashes or freezes. This generally didnt happened until the new update Edit: been fine since the new update however whatever they did for maintance brought back the crashes and freezes pls fix
Recent updates has the game crashing constantly please fix the game
Enjoyable but hard farming for pulls
"This had been working great for me until the latest update. Now, it crashes in the middle of almost every battle. I can't even play the event now and will miss out on everything."
This is still happening...For some reason the game has been crashing for a few days. I'm unable to continue to play the event. Please help us.
Crash
Good game but the price hike really makes me not wanna spend anymore
lore based game. characters are based on real historical figures and mythologies. WAIFUS. this is a game that i would be still playing for years
"The more you ascend a character, the less clothes they wear"
"The increased prices for EU and other regions are way too high and an actual ripoff for all foreign players. Raising prices on android, even tough current policies should not affect us, is a horrible desicion by the developers. With those EU prices I will never buy anything in this game ever again."
retired ;
Needs a safer way to transfer data. Also tell users they need a code.
So good very good this is my favorite gameü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
story is great high overall quality and *lovable* characters
"Lol, over 30% price hike for no reason"
I really enjoy this game but can't access Xmas event crashes at loading screen
"I started playing Grand Order in 2016 on the Japanese Server, this game is a lot of fun and helped me get into the series BUT the 5 star drop rate (1%) and damn near dependency on them in certain arcs and raid battles does make this game ultimately a money pit unless you grind till insanity to build up a unit of 1~4 star characters (5 stars are the best cards in the game but you can complete a majority of the game without them). Other then that it's a great game with a great story and OST"
love the characters and flow of the game.
I can't play the event. It crashes on the loading screen.
"My favourite game of all time to be honest. I've already had a fate bias, but fate/grand order only made me love it even more"
"No pity system yet so you could spend hundreds and hundreds of quartz and dollars and still not get your servant... Other than that, solid story, music, and art."
"A very good game, no exhausting puzzles just great stories and amazing characters.."
It's good
Love this Game even tough people say thr game crashes it dosen't if it does its beacause of your phone's storage
"Ive got a z fold 4 and i put over 1500 hours into this game(on a previous phone and works perfectly) but as soon as i started using this phone it keeps crashing, whenever i use np's especially. Pls fix this issue its killing the game for me </3"
AWESOME SAUCE!!!!!!!
I rolled Jalter
Veteran player but game keeps crashing I can't even start a battle without it crashing
I can't get out of this game please help meüò≠
"Started in 2018. I was a fan of the anime, then delved into this game. It's hell you're walking into. Can you stand the heat, or are you beat (from the journey)? Decide for yourself."
"That's hell you're walking into, Don't do it, Don't play it, I warn you."
Come join us on gacha hell this game may look simple dont look at it like its a easy game this game can cause rage and trauma this is one of the games that has bad gacha system but has godlike story written üòÜ
Love the character ls and the gameplay. Just wished there was a better way to grind saint quartz.
Please do not conduct any maintenance during the play in the process
How can you compare this to the fate franchise? That is a straight out lie. I gave it one star because you lied and 1 was the lowest
"Easily got me demotivated, seriously.... You have been running this game for years and you still won't improve your pity system ... Game is extremely P2W"
Bleh
GREAT
"Wrote a review back in June that the game was unplayable due to crashes. Here we are in October, several updates later, still unplayable. Nice game"
This is Absolutely Lit üíØ
"Beyond fun. Even though I'm playing on a decade old phone, this game runs beautifully, I've enjoyed the story and the characters. I don't know why peole are complaining about crashes, it runs fine on my Samsung s7."
I want this guy
The game said it's not starting properly and said I need to clear cache and reinstall and that you saved data will be remembered but it didn't this game crashs all the time and onto off that you may be playing for nothing if your like me and lose your file because the game refuses to work porperly
"Crashing bug I was having was resolved recently but the amount of time it was present took away the enthusiasm I had for the game. Sounds like other players are still getting crashes though. Levelling is typically confusing through 50 items and currencies, the game is pretty dated in UI design. Did enjoy the gameplay but not enough to put up with the crashes and complexity"
"5 star servants in 120 pulls = 0. Drop rate is garbage. Played to lvl 70, no 5 star servants. Don't waste time or money. I would have bought into the game, but at that low of a pull chance, no way. I've spent thousands on Azur Lane, but they want players to get SSR & UR. Very generous"
Unfortunately kept crashing so I couldn't play
"At the current state the game is impossibile yo play, costanti crashes don't even let me pass the first tutorial"
"Heard this game was good, too bad I'll never know because I couldn't play for a single second because it crashed repeatedly."
Good gacha game
Can't get it to work on my s21 plus
ENFIN DISPONIBLE EN FRANCE. MERCI. THANK YOU. THANK YOUUU !!! ‚ú® I've been playing for almost 3 years now ! Which is amazing because I've never played a game that long !!!! I love the depth of the characters and the event story !! I can't wait for Avalon le Fae to come !!!!
"This game is fun, but has a lag problem and is really grinding bent. The reason I gave it a 1, is because if you accidentally delete your game or delete it and want to re-download it, everything's gone, and there's nothing you can do. Unlike games such as clash Royale or clash of clans, which saves your data, this does not. Any limited time event servants? Gone. If they actually had a way for me to get my account back, solid 4 stars. As of now, very flawed design and add the account feature."
New to the game. I am crashing everytime.
Unplayable. Crashes nonstop for months.
Hate app
"First time trying this game,i hope this doesn't disappoint me.i will change my rating when I chang my mindm"
Frequently freezes and crashes Using an s21 ultra
Enjoyable Gameplay
"Fun if you're a fan of the movies. Mediocre, and confusing if you aren't. No multi- player battles makes this game very repetitive. Lots of potential to be great, but it failed üòî"
"As a 6 year veteran (of JP), I think that this game is worth the investment. Not sure if it's COPIUM though. I can at least say that the customer service (of the JP side) is great. It only took 4 days for me to get my account back, and were extremely helpful. I imagine that the NA team is much the same. I would leave this review in the JP app, but I literally can't soooo here it lays. Actually, I think this was the second time I've lost my account... Oops. Remember to bind your account dudes."
Good sleep aid.
I had to drop the stars to 1 because after the last event ended the game has become unplayable. If I can even get it to load to the main screen it crashes every time I try to do anything! I can no longer play because of the all the constant crashes.
"I've been a veteran player since the beginning but ever since the recent update, the game has become unplayable. It constantly crashes in battle during animation and I can't finish a battle or it just straight up freezes where my phone will tell me fgo is responding close the app or wait. And it truly annoys me to no end, this NEEDS to be fixed."
Best game I've played to far im already at Babylon and have many gold cards which were not easy to get but I would like to be able to get saint quartz a lot more and faster so I have a chance to get gold cards from summons
Its awesome
The ads in city smash are garbage!!!! Its fate grand orders falt even room smash this idiots should delete this game!!!!!!
M√±n
Was really hyped to get back into the game but was not impressed with how much the game crashes. I couldnt even finish a battle given how much the game stops responding. Pls do tackle this problem its such waste
Was very excited to play the game only to have it not work anymore a day after playing. I've tried everything but it keeps telling me to clear cache or restart. I Went in my files I uninstalled and reinstalled and it just won't work
Fun game to play
"I do enjoy the game, but currently I can't even open to the title screen due to it crashing, it's not my internet, it's not the cache that I've cleared, I've already restarted my phone, it's the game itself and well generally ruining your experience is one thing but not even being able to play it, That's another thing"
"I give 4 stars for FGO, the game is fun, the characters are fun and colourful and the summon rate has been pretty kind to me. A variety of low rarity heroes are viable which is also nice. Dont be put off by the early story, which is honestly, a bit terrible, it ends up getting so much more cohesive and enjoyable later on. Now, for my core issue with the game.. sometimes there will be constant crashes and the game becomes totally unplayable, which isnt great when an event is on."
Edit 9/29/22 - can't even select support servant and it will crash the game. How is this still a months long problem?! Edit 8/24/22 it's been 3 months now and Still crashing. Game crashes now with EVERY battle with the last update. On a S21 ultra. Very difficult to even play now. Crashes immediately on loading. Can't battle. Can't check in without it immediately crashing!!
i miss u balik kana
Useful
the transfer account system sucks
"Love the game and its universe but at this point the crashes have made the game completely unplayable. I've tried progressing with the current event but it just keeps crashing repeatedly on the same level. Unfortunately I have to miss out on completing the event and farming because I simply can't launch the game without another crash. The fact that i'm not the only player with this issue is cause for concern and should be addressed immediately. Im vexed, terribly vexed..."
Your game keeps crashing making my experience awful. Plus for a new masters like me cant even participate in the new event. That's frustrating. I may not recomend this to other players if this go on ignored. Sept. 2022 still crashing..
The last update made it horrible.
"Very fun game but it is a commitment at times, it's not for everyone but if you want a excellent story and 2d jpg waifus and husbandos it's agood game for you. Should note that if you aren't lucky you might not get the servants you want."
why are they all lanver
"I'd say that this is one of the best games that I've ever played and the story is phenomenal I'm truly enjoying a lot of it and if others will play it I guarantee that it should be on their list to play although the Gacha portion of the part is lacking for some time but I don't mind over all it's a truly a fantastic game to play. However the Gacha is a major thing that needs to be fixed like get 1 5 star 1 or 2 4 stars and any random number of 3, 2 and 1 stars per summon which would be good."
Game keeps crashing mid game. It wasn't bad in the past but now it happens so frequently that I just give up on playing.
"Broke the display on my phone and lost a 3+ year acct. For as old as the game is, there's still no external sync, you must issue a transfer number. Rates are terrible and it's honestly a great opportunity to find something else. Exploitative gachas are a dime a dozen rn"
"Currently crashing over and over during guda guda, can't even enjoy the event. Been playing since 2018 and it's never been this bad. Pretty unfortunate given how much money players put into the game."
I like the game a lot but I can't play it currently. It crashes whenever I try to start a mission.
Is this game dead? I keep getting stuck at loading screens or screen goes completely black.. I have to keep restarting app just to see what happens next
"Currently there's a bug on Android phones that will consistently crash the game on startup or randomly in-game. I can't even login as a veteran player and have missed banners because of this. Good luck playing as they have not made fixing it a priority. Customer Support said it would be fixed by August 2 with the migration to Unity 2018, but as of writing this it's September. Never heard of a game company with a game breaking bug for a major phone OS and not fix it immediately."
Suck
im having fun but the system is taking too long to respond even from summoning or clicking things i have mid range phone and i lowest my settings but still its unbearable
"The story is interesting and the controls are easy to grasp. Very nice game overall but I do have some issues. Most frequent that's happening to me is that I sometimes get the notice that my internet connection is weak although in fact, it is running quite fast. The other things are not that much of a bother so it's not worth mentioning. It's a very cool game though."
The culmination of Fate franchise!
"I really enjoyed the game but now since the newest android update it crashes any time i attempt to enter a mission. Literally unplayable, the dev team really needs to figure out what causes these crashes."
This game is really extreme
"If this game can play on multi device with 1 account, it is really good."
"I spend all of my sq and ticket yet i didnt get vergil, was i lacking motivation and power?? still great game though"
I think updating your android for your phone makes the game crash because that's what happened to me when my phone gets it's monthly update.
"Too many bugs and lags now... I used to wonder what others were saying, but now I can't open anything without the shutting it down right away. Problems been getting worse every week."
"I haven't been able to play since March. Crashes at start after a few seconds, and hasn't been fixed. Take your money/time to other gacha games, I would say."
Good game wish they would make it for consoles to and make ways to get more ap so I can play longer üòç.
I love this game but as of the guda guda event it keeps crashing every time I go into battle üòî. It's becoming unplayable
Good story and characters but it will be like clocking into a job
The game simply crashes too often. Haven't played a game so buggy where the devs do not release a patch within a week
Nice game here's a five star
Its the best game i ever play in my life Five stars
The game is currently UNPLAYABLE on my Samsung. Nonstop crashing! Very frustrating because I can't even do the current event.
"These never ending crash makes the game unplayable, can't even do this event because of the crashes"
"This app might be rated high or decently, but it is very hard to justify a decent rating for Fate Crash Order. Maybe make the app usuable to get a proper review, as I frequently flip a coin on if it is playable or if I crash dozens of times before I get back the title screen."
"When I first lost my account I was pissed beyond belief however ever since I started replaying the game I have always been having insanely good luck with my rolls. Maybe it's just karma paying me back for all of the good things I have done, Maybe the game felt bad for me either way It doesn't matter. With my current rolls I should be able to breeze through camelot by February if I'm focused enough."
My Fgo Account is Something going on with it when I Start it up the Loading screen is fine but when it try to head into the main NA it's Just Pure Black and I Can't access anything at all Does anyone else have that problem or is it just Me?
Schnazy units
Give game one star rate summon banner bad spend ticket i got nothing only 4 star cards characters spend gems 60 them got nothing not new character if make rate better give it 4 star
After event update game keeps crashing constantly
great game..
"Honestly the game is quite fun, but it crashes bloody constantly. Most often when launching the game and often when exiting a level."
I Lucifer Tempest will try to challenge this so called hell
Download it and can't even play it.. it crashes every i open it.
"Nonstop crashes since update, the game is basically unplayable this is coming from an android user ever since this ""big update"" the game won't load you can't get back your account if it's like this, fix this!!!! Otherwise bye üëã"
Excellent Story for those who love the fate Series
"Game keeps crashing. Can't even get into the game. Keeps crashing in start screen and when I can play, constantly crashes in battles and sometimes in loading screens. I love this game, but man this is really starting to be a bother."
5/5 story
"It is a great gacha game from a franchise with interesting stories for its characters. I always wanted this game here in Europe ever since watching the shows on Netflix and finally its here. The only real downside is, that the gacha is incredibly hard (at least on me and a few friends of mine) and you got no opportunity to get ""free"" servants from already gone events except for a rerun that only happens once More Saint Quartz would also be appreciated"
Lousy interface... doing quests and other stuff is really bothersome a lot of unecessary stuff takes too long to do something before you could get to the quest you have to click this and that ... specially collecting rewards my goodness so annoying ... make the things you do in the game simple ... good point of the game interested with the concept other than that because of those annoying parts üëéüëéüëé
Dattebayyo
"Not really appealing for me. UI is too simple that it confuses you, there's no start up banner where you can get SSR, not even an event for newcomers to understand the game fully in return for some rewards, and every panel I clicked there are tutorials which takes 10 secs to appear. But atleast on your ads, you didn't state that there are event or rewards that will be given to new players so atleast you're honest. Overall, it is main game material but not for me."
Won't load great üòêüòê
Crashes all the time. The summoning sucks I never get anything good even after using 300 plus Saint Quartz
"This game really shows its age. The worst is the lack of a cloud storage, making losing your account a potential reality if you somehow misplace the app. The combat is the type of easy but hard to master, unfortunately battles will start to feel repetitive and slow. The servants and story are well written though, especially if you're a follower of the series. Lastly the gacha isn't forgiving, so expect to not get a 5‚òÜ and it might spare you one day"
Please fix the lags it crashes my game and closes my phone.
The crashes happen less frequently but it is still crashing randomly.
"Game is wonderfull for me as i just started playing but the game crashes so many times, please fix this."
Virus
I use to love it but the game save feature stinks. I tried to reload it on the same device after it was acting up and it restarted my game
I can't play the game anymore... it said can't reach server and no internet connection... which is not true... can't open the game anymore despite clearing data and cache... to the point of reinstall... the problem persist
"I do really enjoy the characters and the gameplay quite a bit, there are definitely problems tho, like to the lack of animation updates for some older units, no Story replay or proper account system and a pretty outdated Ui. Also the current lack of a safety net kinda makes the Gacha part just into literal gambling. Not to mention that the current powercreep is getting more and more of a problem and the pace with that the story progresses is quite slow. Overall a like a 6/10, ok but not amazing"
Game for dog play!
The game pausees a lot but other than that it is good
Like many others that play this hidden gem of a game. I love it and will gladly rate 5 stars if you can please fix the god awful loading screens they TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD ANYTHING PLEASE FIX AND ILL GIVE 5 STARS.
"Unable to use the game after logging in can't summon,can' farm and can't level up servents"
Your ads are annoying üëç
I love gacha
"Introduce a pity system of some kind. The game introduced a lot of things to keep you productive and farming especially for new players getting a stable roster. Though it almost doesn't matter if I get hundreds of thousands of quartz annually when there is no pity to guarantee anything. People would be willing to dump money for an eventual pity pull even if it was a spook or dupe it would be something. Also banner rates are trash, at least do a pity for those so when we hold quartz it matters."
jonty tititoriehsjdkgo
Five star cots it's really amazing I like it the drawing
"Gacha hell, dont play it, if you are new uninstall it, im al ready done for, I cant stop playing this living hell, save yourselves while you still can"
"Any word on when this would be fixed, can't even open the game without it crashing. I even tried some random fixes from other reviews but nothing works. Really sad how long the game has been in its current state but hopefully we get a fix soon"
Vladzerker is the only reason to continue playing now.
D gatcha is hard to get the ssrüòë
"Having been playing JP along with this, I still find it quite enjoyable, especially with the story. My current issue is the constant crashing happening on my Galaxy S21 Ultra. I understand JP already had a fix that included a 60FPS toggle so I hope that update arrives real soon."
One reason only for this game and for myself: Raikou (btw I want her soooooo bad)
I think this game is great but is this game offline
Quiet good for a mobile game and It's free.
"Since the last update I haven't been able to play a single quest. It crashes continuously whenever it tries to load into a battle. All my hardware is up to date, so I don't know what in the world is going on here."
Finally came to Europe
"I played this last month and totally enjoyed it, but recently I deleted it by Accident anf Now I can't recover my Account cuz I didn't manage to get its Transfer Code. I would Appreciate it alot if I can have it back"
It keeps on lagging. While I don't have probs in my phone or even the game app itself. I am always updated.
Love this game one of my favorite.
Milking money Drop rate low
"Single best narrative-focused game on Android. On the gameplay side, there are gacha mechanics for building your team, which you can power up through grinding. There are also a lot of limited-time events that give you tons of resources and free exclusive units, if you can put up with the grind. Outside of that it's just reading, but it's a damn good story. If you can take it easy on the grinding as to not burn yourself out and just enjoy the story, I recommend this game whole heartedly."
I love this game so much
It's fun and I love it
I CLICK BUTTON AND GIRL APPEAR
Amazing game just dont complain about the gacha rates it's part of the fun to suffer
good sleep aid
"Although the game has very low GACHA rate, it is possible for you to get your five star if you faithfully save up sq. The story, after singularity 5, became much MUCH better and lostbelt 5 even made me cry. The characters are lovable and the events are fun. All in all, as someone who played this game for 5 years, and who also played many other GACHA games, it's a 5/5 game."
I enjoy this game but over the past couple of months I've had issues with it crashing during noble phantasms. It's not unplayable but annoying.
hell
greatest story and writing of any gacha i have played. characters have great personality.
Good but gacha system is bad
Thanks for the 5 star servants.
"all pain, no gain"
Game runs fine now. Hopefully the new update works perfectly
constantly crashing
Fate gooooo
Great game. Nothing bad to say about it
Gacha gacha gacha gacha did i mention the gacha i love the gacha
Its good for fans of FGO:)
Fate is one of my favorite animes oat and im so glad they have a game like this it's great and recommend it to play
"The late game is just rolling, waiting for free quartz, lose all of said quarts to your targeted servant and not even a single copy is given, repeat. The events are mid and repeatitive its either farming or a challenge quests, the story is okay but unlike the first arc where its really good, the lostbelts are just OK. And pity system? Nope, you have to be lucky to get 5 extra copy after getting 5 for np upgrades its dumb."
horrible
Overall Good keep up the good work ‚ù§Ô∏è
It's an ok game
Tellement contente que le jeu soit enfin disponible en France ! Le seul jeu mobile que je n'ai jamais l√¢ch√© !
This is the game ever made
"The gameplay became smoother, much better than before. It doesn't load as much as before. üòåüòåüòå"
"Good story and character design. Severely lacking in a lot of aspects when compared with other gachas. No pity system (JP has one but you have to spend nearly $5k for it to kick in lmao), no auto farming, accounts are not linked to anything other than a transfer code and if you lose it you are SOL, and even though its an older game some animations still make my galaxy s10+ lag. If you can get past those things, or just like the fate franchise it's pretty good."
If my comment doesn't blow up I'm gon a commit suicide
"Edit: The random crashing seems to be cleared up again! Not sure what fixed it, but I no longer crash when using NPs."
Hoping the next Lostbelt comes soon this year.
Love the story and the community. Great turn-based gameplay.
Best of luck in your pulls future master.
Rate this game 1 when i play some games with ads this game is on my like what the heck
The Game is good. But the loading screen is terrible. you need to optimize your game. it always lagging
"$800+ = ZERO 5* characters. Gacha system has no pity system either. Story and event progression is locked behind having specific units for certain encounters. Possibly the most unfriendly game for new players. Don't buy into the hype, the story isnt that great. Game mechanics are still archaic too. Have fun baby sitting your device while farming mats with no auto or multi-run options. There are too many better gacha games to waste your time on this one."
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I DIDNT GET OKITA SOUJI
Try singeng
Android WebView is causing crashes AGAIN.
"RNG why have you forsaken me. Would only recommend if youre a fan of turn based games, the story is probably the main selling point especially if your a fan of type-moon. Gacha rates are um yeah... you get used to it. Is one of the few games where low rarity characters can somethings be better than higher rarity ones."
Actually unplayable with the amount of crashes and lags
"Started playing because I liked Fate stuff, played for 2-3 years, got burnt out because of the grind. The gameplay got boring, it's your run of the mill turn based game. Only stayed for that long for the characters but it's not enough to make me stick around."
It's great for now But I recommend developing this game on Steam for a bigger Audience
add arena or pvp ... thats all i ask
"The game has an absolutely phenomenal story that I enjoy greatly. Unfortunately, for the past several months the stability of the game has become almost nonexistant. Trying to do missions makes the game crash, and sometimes it takes a half dozen or more log-ins to clear one mission if it let's me play it at all. Reinstalling fixed it briefly, but doesn't work anymore. If they can fix this, I will move this to a 5 star review."
"No waifu, Wallet gone, Gacha rate is a lie"
"The farming is nightmare-level with an awful summon system. That favorite waifu you have? Yeah, good luck getting her. 0.04% chance and that's just level 1. The development team thought a shop would help, but it killed any chance of getting much-needed items like the Phoenix Plume. ""Friend points "" are useless; give us the cubes to buy items."
You always ads may phone so I decided download
I've spent $$$$$ on this game and love it (and the Fate franchise) so much. But holy moly please fix the constant crashing. I'm really sad I haven't been able to play for a while now. I'm on a galaxy S22+ with all the latest updates. This is unacceptable.
"Im having my 200th day in fgo tomorrow, all I can say about this game is its story is exceptional. Pretty good gameplay (varies in preference) and its gacha rate isn't bad as far as pity is considered. I have 19 ssr (2 of which I have at np2 and np3) and I'm hoping to get more on my 1st year mark."
this is a game that iwant
Having to edit my review because the game has become unplayable with it's constant crashes. Please fix your game.
Fossil. It had a good run.
As a fan of the entire fate franchise I really do like this game
"For short, the gacha has bad drop rates and the story is boring."
Sht game
This game is so awesome
This game be long af but I tried playing
I cant even get into the game. It crashes as soon as i get it loading
"I love this game alot....and i can take it anywhere on my phone. Only dislike is that in my opinion we should be able to pick one free servant to our choosing when we first start playing. I spent 70 quartz and 4 tickets, $23 bucks and still couldnt get my favorite servant. That sucked. But everything else is flawless. Update 9-9-22 we need a training mode with no benefits if you defeat different bosses or enemies."
Really shows its age.
I wish we can create our own character avatar to make it feel more inclusive. :)
"Very good, story goes first as it is from a visual novel series, but that does not mean the gameplay is bad, it is a very grind intensive game but for me that's good, the gacha is not the best but even 1 star characters can be used as long as you have the right supports."
"I really enjoy the game, but recently it has been unplayable for me. Everytime I attempt to start any quest, the game freezes, then crashes on me for no reason whatsoever."
Game is all messed up and keeps crashing. when will they do something. s21 Ultra btw
Come join the easy way exciting game
Fun game but recently my game has been having trouble loading. Also the gacha rates are horrible
Too long loading page even with 100 mbps speed
"Love the game, lost my game data 2 times but customer service helped me get my data back"
"Ever since the update, the game has been crashing. Is there a fix? Edit: still crashing"
Walang kwentang laro Punyeta

So recently they did something which makes a bunch of EU countries unable to buy SQ ... very cool after all that money i gave your company you would treat us like this...
Pity system is scuffed
"The game is great fun for Fate fans and I'm so glad that we can finally play this after being available in the US for 5 years! The game is fun, entertaining and addictive. It makes me want to continue playing to either continue the enjoyable story or to grind for materials. Almost everything is so satisfying. The only thing I'm not a fan of is how little gems you get and how expensive it is to buy premium items."
Wish I could do anything without it freezing and crashing constantly with this recent update and it sucks that the 5th anniversary is going on right now.
"Don't bother playing this game. I've wasted over 150+ saint quartz and guess what? I've got nothing but pointless cards and servants which are only 3 stars. Gacha sucks in there. Not only that, the story itself is pretty much saving the world by having this time travel stuff."
I cant open it Its loading To error
I normally would give it a higher rating but for some reason the moment after I pick a support servant it would crash on me and this started happening right after the daily reset
game is unplayable because of the crashes
I have an S20+ which is more than capable of playing fgo and the game is constantly crashing since shishou fest started. Please put out a fix and apologems
Video Games and apps on your time and consideration and I
"I've enjoyed playing this game but recently with the updates, the game is consistently crashing making it unplayable. Originally 5 starred this app and brought it down to 2 due to this issue Hopefully it gets resolved soon. :/"
Waifus
"Dropped from 5 stars to 1. So is the issue specific to phones? Was having the issue of the game freezing and shutting down for months and got no help from staff. Had to transfer to tablet and game worked wonders. Had to transfer back to phone for work and what do you know, the issue picked eight back up. Freezing, crashing, not loading etc. So is this a phone issue?? Please staff, get this fixed!!!"
Entering the game will take longer. This game are only required to those people who have strong internet.
I installes this because it looks like anime that's what catch my attention and yeah that's it and i also like the story mode love it a big W üëåüôÇ
This is so
After last update game constantly crashes I can't even get through a Mission anymore and it's upsetting because I've been playing for years. Have already cleared cashe and uninstalled and reinstalled
Stopped working on android again!!! Cmon fix your game or refund for those who made purchases! Totally unusable.
Pls kill the protagonist
RNG BULL AND CONNECTION ERROR
I love this game not just because it is a fate game it is mostly because of all the cute waifus.
Keeps crashing every time i use a noble phantasm
"If you have a Samsung phone, the game will crash constantly. It's been like this for months and they still have not fixed it. Uninstalling Android System Webview app can help sometimes but it still crashes during events for some reason. Fun game if they could just fix the crashes."
Would be nice to play the game without it crashing every 60 seconds....
I love this game there is always something new. My only issue is that once in awhile I can't log in no matter what I do.
"I play this game out of curiosity and after finishing the tutorial, I got bored. It must be the graphics or the npc that keeps annoying me in her native language. I dunno. Maybe it's the gameplay itself or just a shallow reason that I didn't get the character they've been advertising. To think of it, I like fast games and sometime, slow automated zen ones. This game is neither and probably the reason I can't dig it. It's not for me. You feel me?"
"If you are experiencing crashing, 1) the devs have announced that they are working on it and 2) in the meantime, here's a fix for you. On your Google play store, look for an app called Android System Webview. Uninstall it, then download a different app called Android System Webview Beta. Fixed the issue for me and many others, and I haven't had a crash since. You don't need to do anything else, just Uninstall and download and you should be all set. You're welcome!"
The battle sound is too loud! It hurts my ear! I even used the lowest volume and it's still loud! Please fix it and when fighting the movements are laggy. I don't know how the sound passed the testing part but im disappointed.
Finally officially in EU
"Cool game, but the pull rate is too hard and absurdly pricey for the amount of resources they give you. Very amazing art and soundtrack though."
"It's complicated. The story is okay at first, then becomes truly something special later on as it discovers it's own identity, the gameplay is good and is an interesting spin on turn-based RPGs, and the character designs are generally more appealing and unique over other gacha games. However, material grind is awful, and the pity system - INCLUDING the JP-only system at the time of the review - is absolutely a joke. This is slightly offset by the fact that low-stars are actually viable."
"Extremely dated, low pull rates and no pity."
Unbelievable that this is one of the top grossing games and it's completely unplayable. It quits multiple times per battles for no reason. Absolutely unacceptable. How can you morons make a game like this? It can't be that hard to fix
Fate is best gacha game.
Ever since the update the game became unplayable and just crashes as soon as I log in
Game has been crashing during every battle since last update. I haven't been able to complete any battles since the event started on my phone. It's an S20 so it's not the phone.
The game is unplayable. The App is constantly crashing.
Im only rating it this low due to the constant crashing. I enjoy the game but can't even play it.
The game is constantly crashing please fix it
hard to find the redeem code.nice game only problem this game is not for no spender players. free ascension trial for 90days lol
The game itself is fine. Standard team based gatcha. But this English port is so unstable. I've had 8 crashes in an hour.
Game keeps crashing when trying to load into battle.
Bad rates
Love the game. Characters are fun and different. Seen the majority of the shows. But the last update has messed it up. As soon as I go to log in the entire app crashes.
"Best Waifus, Best Game. Saber BEST GIRL!"
"Decent Fate game. If you like Fate, you'll like this, and are probably already playing it."
do you nead to download resources in dis game
Dated combat expense be game rely on sunken cost to keep u in. That is my cade
All good it was fixed with the update no more freeze. For 2022 summer event no more freezing. Game is fun but hope to see pity next year or soon if they can implement in the future. Same as before is crashing for me now. I'm surprised since I played it before it was smooth. Now is freezing making me close the game and reopen.
WHY IS UR ADS KEEP COMING TO ME WHENEVER I PLAYüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Edit: Crashing constantly again. I've finally uninstalled after years of playing. Good riddance. One of the greediest gachas on the market. There are welfare servants in the game so f2p is technically viable but there's no pity system in NA for a few more years. Material grinding is likewise obtuse, stingy, and tedious. Go play Epic7, Arknights, or even Alchemy Stars for an actual positive play experience instead of this garbage."
What a waste of time it is boringüòëüòë
Finally come to the UK a must play for all FATE fans the story is so good
"It is crashing every minute for me, what happened? I can't finish any battles."
"Fun game but a bit repetitive. The summoning system is bare bones, no real indication you're going to summon anything special which to me comes off shady. Other gacha games at least give you a sign a special summon is happening, the reason I'm saying this is because the summoning rates are terrible. All in all it's coming off as a greedy developer behind this game."
Vayazauy Oays and Alyssa Milano to end the home üè° and Haha and Haha and Alyssa Milano cookies are flat for
"Good, but without their IP. this game would've just been ok. Gameplay - 5/10 Story - ? (Skipped) Art - 7/10 UI - 5/10 Fun - 5/10 (pull rates, grinding, etc.) No new or exciting gameplay. Grind is a pain. 5* Rates are set TOO low to keep people pulling. UI is everywhere. Relying on 5* allies to clear content sucks. Rewards are mediocre when the total cost to upgrade and obtain heroes/equipments are immense. P.S. Play the game if you know their IP. And like to read stories. LONG STORIES."
Game slow af loading takes 10 mins
"Getting only CE's from first days of server in the new banner is a joke, they don't care about the players, only the money they got..."
"It crashes a lot, pls fix"
it won't even start?! dumb. after playing since the start... maybe it's time to drop this stupid game?
FINALLY IT AVAIBLE HERE!!!!!
I've not experienced crashes so not gonna talk about them. I'm a launch day player and DW and then Lesangle have treated us players more than fair. They reward us if they mess up. Farming can be tedious and it feels like a chore. Auto farming?
11/10 depression
Good game quartz too scarce for the drop rates you get
"I love how there are the original characters from Fate/Stay Night and new characters as well. I love how easy it is to play and love the way of the Servant's organized information. The game hasn't been good lately, and there are too many events with little time between. I feel there is nothing but fanservice more."
Boring cringe mess that makes lectures feel fun

Hihhhiiii
One of the only game I kept on my phone for so long and kept on downloading on my new phones
Great app
So nice game
Played this game since launch and now it's crashing a ridiculous amount. It's been ongoing since January but now FGO is basically unplayable for me. I can't play this game until something is done about it. Playing on a Galaxy S10+.
"This game is terrible it's as simple as that, I've had this game for years and I have so many characters but it takes way too long in order to get the materials you need in order to summon them and make them stronger. Also if you accidentally delete the game you won't be able to get your account back on the game easily. Seriously fix it to where you like you can link your account to your email or something to make it easier."
"pity is too low,drops rates are too low everything is too low here i play for 2 months and i still have only 1 five star character after i get 30 SQ i pull and got nothing"
Very interested
"Ever since the latest update from the previous event, the game has pretty much become unplayable. Can't even play an event mission without the game crashing either during an attack animation or during the transition. Trying to play this game has become nothing but a waste of time as long as the game continues to crash consistently."
Game keeps crashing every time I use a Noble Phantasm and I'm on a Galaxy S10e. Edit: It was fixed for several months and now it is back.
"This game is really fun, the story is engaging and the gamplay loop is enjoyable. The only thing that I could say that you might not like is how unlikely it is to get the best units. Other than that everything else is very polished and well designed."
Absolutely spectacular game with all the waifus you could want
"Amazing game, but been experiencing frequent crashes since the summer event until now. Really annoying and I know it's not a problem with my phone's capability considering it's a gaming phone."
"Love it. Amazing game. I am a long time player. However for the past few days, it has been quitting every two minutes recently."
"Enjoyable story and mechanics so far. I would prefer it if we could chose to not bring a support servant, as the ones available are so highly leveled (unless NPC) that the fights aren't a challenge at all, and due to needing to input three command cards if you have enough, are almost impossible to not use."
Love the game but it's literally unplayable keeps crashing every few minutes since grail front update.
The game has become so unplayable that this will be the second straight event that i can not complete because the game crashes so hard that i can not complete a single wave without having to restart over a dozen times. I like this game but since the Ooku event i can not finish even one round without the game crashing.
been playing since 2017 good game jalter best girl
Best game nice too
Ruined my life
Love the story missions and the characters!!
"Tying to transfer my account, but I can't actually sign in, so this is my rating."
Liked this one
Motivated
"I enjoy the game quite a bit, but as of recently they game keeps crashing whenever an attack or skill occurs. I'm on a newer phone, so this shouldn't be an issue at all. I tried clearing the cache and reinstalling the game, but even during the tutorial it crashed. I will not be playing until this is fixed."
I will give a 5 because its a good game but i still dont have mommy Saber
Really boring introduction / tutorial
fix your damn crashing.
Is it me or the game doesn't start in the beginning??? Just load black screen and crash everytime also clearing the cache too.
"To start, I just want to be upfront that I love this game and have been a casual player since 2017. Now that that's out of the way, I'm giving it one star because it's been borderline unplayable for months on my Galaxy Note 20 (the only device I play it on). Every time I use an NP, there's a not insignificant chance the game will either freeze or just entirely force close. It's really sucked all the fun out of what is a game I normally love to play. Unbelievable that it's still not fixed."
As much as it is a fun game please fix the stability of the game. The number of times the games crashes after an update is absurd. Using a Galaxy S22.
"Played a while ago, ditched it because the pull rates were awful, that or im incredibly unlucky. Redownloaded to give it another shot and its barely playable. Been awake for 20 minutes and its already crashed on me 5 times. Not to mention the pull rates are still terrible. Played for about 2 weeks now and havent pulled anything above a 3 star other than the guarenteed 4 star you get from 10x summons."
"The best turn based game i've ever played up until now, but I hope the devs would consider pvp mode to showcase servants that would be awesome if ever made possible.. Other than that still an awesome game keep it upüôè"
"This game is very well made but, the summon rates are very bad. I'll spend hours completing a chapter of the game to get 30 jewels, only to summon a three star character."
Thanks to you and I got my account back. I rate it 5 stars
"Great game, shocking stability. Freezes all the time, loading takes forever, not worth the drama of trying to play the actual game!"
Jeanne (Archer) supremacy
"Repeated crashes on latest update. Using a Samsung Galaxy S22. Consistently crashes between launching, between the cutscene and fight, and during the fight. Won't be playing till this is fixed, it's unplayable. I can't even finish a stage."
This is the gacha game with the best story and tons of great characters but the 5+ years it has been around haven't been kind to it. Monetization is downright predatory compared to other games in the genre. I'm locked in after years of play and thousands of dollars in spending but my advice is don't start.
"I Have Found 2 Translations Problems, 1 Occurs At The Military Beachead And Another At The Bandit Checkpoint When You Sell Vodka To Him."
This game is awesome i really like it and how much mbps do i need to play this game cause our internet is a bit slow i cannot play every time because of the slow net even though i want to play this game every time...
Game keeps crashing
"Daily-grind to keep the FOMO at bay, now with a FATE skin. Story is OK, as long as you know what to expect."
Crashes after the title screen on the Z Fold 4
Constant crashing I can't even do any quests or anything without it crashing I'd rate 5 stars if I was able to actually play and enjoy the game
last few months the game crashes constantly. latest quest won't even load. emailed about it and team requested so much information it felt like they were a scam for identity theft
Bruh still no skadi
"The Summom rates are really low, the game itself has an ok story. It's just really boring rock paper scissors, but I have a cat that throws a plate of rice."
"I'm quite annoyed that I wasn't able to get my info to log back when my data is deleted because now the game forecloses on me right after pressing start. This game has completely lost my interest, especially with having to start over to begin with on top of not even being able to log in. At this moment it's wasting space on my phone. I personally am unable to play this game and I'm ready to delete."
Unplayable game when the fight scene it always freeze and crash sometimes please fix this
The download is too long so i uninstall it..
This game is nice!!!!!!!!!!! I love it so much!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please install this app guys!!!!!!!!!!
I've been playing for more than 3 years. Best time of my life
"A really good gacha game through and through, and a real treasure for Fate fans, the rates may not be the best but in my experience the amount of currency you can obtain is good enough to get some more rare servants but even when you're unlucky, the free servants you can get from Friend Point summons are often good enough for a lot of stuff, examples would The Regend Kojiro, The Chad Arash or Chen Gong (Friendly Fire On Edition) Overall a good experience in my eyes biased by all Nasuverse stuff"
"This is a great story-based mobile game about traveling through altered history in an attempt to restore it to avert the end of humanity, and you do so with heroes based on history or mythology. The story starts slow, but is awesome from the Camelot singularity. There's a mix of fun, drama, and emotion with the varietal cast of interesting characters you'll want to raise. Gameplay is ok. Gacha is gacha, but you can earn strong servants and CEs in most events which are creative and unique."
"If the crystals needed to do the summons wasn't behind a huge paywall, I'd give more stars. The gameplay is decent, but not the rewards."
the game runs pretty well the only problem is that ut freezes alittle after turns and it crashes after summons
"It started out fun, but then it revealed itself as a boring gacha-style cash grab with events that were essentially pay-to-win. And heavenforbid if you uninstall it and reinstall it later... your progress will be GONE."
Not as good compared to fgo japanese
Deleted the game because it keeps on crashing.
"Game constantly crash, can't do anything, using galaxy flip 4"
"Please please please fix this error. I'm tired of it force closing, freezing or disconnecting from the server. I am trying so hard to keep up with the event but I can't even do it because it keeps restarting or otherwise. So much progress lost"
Solid Game
While I'm playing the app suddenly stop in middle of quest please fix that
This game has been freezing and crashing on me since the summer update. Game is literally unplayable due to it. The Devs need to fix this game.
"S22 Ultra user, after the new update, I can't play the game as it would crash literally on the loading screen, even if it gets past that it will crash soon after. It's quite unfortunate, was really looking forward to playing the new event too. üòï"
App crashes constantly on Samsun devices for months. This needs to be resolved. Keep losing time during events bc its unplayable at times
Been played since 2end of 2018 thank god it got localized to nz
Games crashing after update August 2022
Nc game
Game has been crashing during battle sessions since yesterday
tiktok ads is good
"It always crashes at loading screen, I can't even play anymore. I tried unisntall and re-install but it still crashes"
I want to smash ushiwakamaru üò©
"The game is very simple to play, characters in the game are very interesting, some of the arts is interesting as well tho the gameplay are very interesting at first but for the long run, it's becoming more a bit boring but one thing that I couldn't agree more is how Story of the game is very interesting, easy to understand and has a lot of ups and downs in terms of how you feel about a certain part of a story"
Play it if you are a fan of the Fate series. Save quartz and roll for your waifu.
"Just like the series the game is based on, 90% of it is unnecessary and just a cash grab with a ridiculous drop rate for rare characters. One of thw worst mobile games out there"
Welcome to gacha hell üòà
Its good if u like fate.
Game keeps crashing suddenly every time i go to battle. Please fix it
Wow fro the Digito Im a Shane
Crash simulator 2022
The game stopped crashing. At least for me.
Ys VI Online ~ The Ark of Napishtim ~ („Ç§„Éº„ÇπVI OnlineÔΩû„Éä„Éî„Ç∑„É•„ÉÜ„É†„ÅÆÂå£ÔΩû?) is a mobile MMORPG based on the original Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim. It's a Free-to-Play online game containing microtransactions.
"Awesome that it's now also available in the eu play store, but why is euro still not an accepted currency. So even if it's now on EU store, those who download it there wouldn't be able to buy saint quartz. Doesn't affect me rlly cause I stay f2p but it kinda seems counterproductive given how much they could make of off making euro accepted currency. Tho gameplay-wise easily the best haha game out there."
The moment i saw ur characters i had enough of seeing them cuz they all are so hot ngl im downloading this üòã
"Update: Lasengle has said that it is the Unity2018 engine causing crashes with Android only and it will be fixed end of August supposedly. Was doing fine again for a bit but newest update/event has brought back crashing every other round and I can't enjoy the game. Developers claimed they had no way to fix the issue until recently, but they fixed the issue in JP over a year ago so I don't buy it. Are you going to tell us not to download Android 13 too with it around the corner? Ridiculous."
not enough saber faces
It is great but I atleast wan to save my progressz for example saving to google play or in facebook
One of the best tales' games made
Would give a 5 star rating if it wasnt crashing when i try to do just about anything
active
"I have a Samsung galaxy s20, have been playing since day one, but recently can't get the app to load battles."
Happier than ever yey
its a great game that I enjoy. It have great events. But gacha rate is meh.
Can't believe people play this trash game
Fgo is good with its characters and other fighting games and story the story is good and so are the events I totally recommend this game for when you are lazy :)
"I really love the game, it's fun and exciting but, with it crashing 10 seconds after I open the app saddens me. So the latest update kept me from having fun."
RNG heavy
Gacha is trash but great game and story overall!
Haven't played the game to much but I love fate apochrypha If you love a good story or just enjoy fate it's a perfect game
My life has gone downhill since I installed this game
Still a great game to play.
"The game was fun and then wasted a lot of Saint Quartz and tickets on the gacha on these past 6 months still no four or five star servants even in anniversary of fgo that got a lot of SQ in game it pains me that not even a four star appeared during when I'm rolling on the gacha during anniversary saved up to 1,763 SQ and 125 Tickets only Craft Essence has appeared only"
One of the best gacha games
This game is not perfect but it's still a great game as someone who just plays it for the lore it still has that fate feel. The lack of a pity system is painful for free to play players but none the less 5/5.
it's a historical figure collector game with great visuals.
"Gacha rolls are suffering, everyone should know this. If you don't think you can cope well with that, best to avoid this game, as it will toss you 3 star after 3 star whenever you can save some summon currency. Give it enough time, and you will _eventually_ get lucky and build a team, but don't expect to get your waifu any time soon. Other than gacha flaws, this game is quite enjoyable, has a fair bit of story content to work through. Will last players quite some time."
"Nice game totally complete story but I can't saved my data game in any other social media accounts I don't know why,"
Nice game and good graphics
Awesome W game
App keeps force closing randomly.
"The story is gorgeous, and you fall in love with all characters and their story"
Games keeps crashing each time I'm loading into a battle
Being a Fate fan is the best and worst thing to ever happen to me
probably the most fun mobile game I've ever played but not a fan of gacha mechanics
"Great Game, excellent characters. Just need lots of luck to get the servants you want."
"I think anyone who reads the reviews from the past 3-4 months will see that there's a consistent trend of the game crashing constantly. My review is no exception. Crashes in the middle of a battle turn. Crashes when game goes to support menu. Crashes during dialogue. Crashes during loading screen. Crashes when I'm LITERALLY DOING NOTHING. If I wasn't a day one FGO player and spent hundreds of dollars on this game, I'd have uninstalled this and be done with it already. FYI I'm a S22 Ultra user."
Crashes constantly. Can't even play the game.
An entertaining game with plenty to do
UmU
"This game has an amazing story. Each characters has their own thing that makes them special. Events are fun and sometimes silly or sad. Although farming gets reparative, getting your waifus and husbando to max lvl is always worth it. Tech support is amazing. I lost my account that had a limited 5 star. I emailed support and in 2 days I got my account back. I recommend downloading this game."
The game has been satisfying their users with events and its absolutely amazing
Constantly crashing again. Can barely finish a single battlr cause it will crash after every attack.
THE BEST STORY.
After playing much more of this game and actually thinking about the game play I've come to live the fact that all the Characters from 1 to 5 star can all be used in almost every piece of content. I've even found that some 3 stars are better the 5 stars in some places. I still love this game to bits and I'm excited for what's to come.
Down side of this game no data save at all ‚îê(Õ°¬∞ ñÃØÕ°¬∞)‚îå??
It good üëç
"Im so astronomically extatic with this fun game, i loved the part where i pulled the gacha and got nothing."
So amazing ü§©üòç I love this g√°me
I truly enjoy the story and characters. Wish they would use the Grail Front mechanic more or have permanent boss battles so that there is more option foe getting materials vs just farming the same nodes.
"Gacha rates are hell, but it's a great story to experience. Gameplay is very dated with no auto. You can complete all of the story using the 3*s and under. Resource grinding to raise servants is hard aside from events. Edit. 8/22 early qol ports from JP and clear cubes make it realistic for be players to upgrade a few servants with materials locked behind future chapters which makes this more new player friendly."
I love this game the art style strategy to put into this
It's just really fun and (so far) not too hard to acquire saints quartz
It crashs every other minute

"I'm a fan of a lot of the characters in this game, like Okada Izo and Arjuna for instance. But I find the amount of little girls in suggestive clothing and all that to be disturbing and uncomfortable. Especially when they are supposed to be based off real life people, including serial killers. Also, game has a lot of random lag spikes. The game is good, but I find it uncomfortable at times."
"Fix the game pls, it keeps closing on it's own after a while and it is getting rlly annoying"
A lot of servants with big boobas. Noice
It is a very fun recreation gacha game of the fate sires. :)
Newest update causes the game to be unplayable it crashes midway through every fight and crashes when loading the event shop I'm on a Galaxy fold 3
Love the storyline
Good game...
Pretty mid story Cool chatacter designs Fun gameplay in a sense If you like this kind of RPG
I really injoying the game
Ydid
Best game so far
The first good gacha
"Gatcha is bad civilization, but the story is fun."
"very swag i really like the battles, the plot but the summoning system really sucks put a pity rate come on"
This app on Samsung Note10+ keeps crashing please fix this
"Love the game, if your game crashes check your version of ChromeWebview, it's probably causing you issues."
Smash
Awesome. I've been playing for 4/5 years on the US server. Now it's on UK Google play. If you like the anime you'll love it. The campaign and events are enjoyable and entertaining.
Astolfo is in it. Enough said.
"Despite having an incredibly low pull rate for the top servants and essence, it does have an actual full story that you can play through without needing the absolute best of the best. With no auto mode it demands actual interaction which is something you don't see on a lot of mobile games nowadays. Four out of five only because I did not know much about the Fate universe."
best gacha game without any competition
Pretty fun
Rates are a lie lol. If 150 pulls aren't enough for a single 5 star then I don't know what to say
1 year playing this game and no ssr? screw my luck üòî or.. the system?
Too much grinding and the gachas is pretty brutal.
"This is an amazing game, I've been playing for 2 years now and let me tell you I don't want to play any other mobile game because of FGO. The game has a unique and fun story, surprisingly fun combat, funny community and most importantly of all the marvellous characters to get. The only downside to the game is device you use as it may not be able to run the game. You need at the very least 1.5 gb or preferably 2 gb to run the game, you could also use an emulator to play on pc."
Carried by lore fr
Still the best gacha currently available.
"Finally available in NZ, best news ever"
"Overall, The story and character cast in this game is impressive for a gacha. It starts off slow but the later chapters and characters really draw you in. It's got comedy, action etc and It's pretty much a massive visual novel but it's for free. Gameplay starts off simplistic but the content does get harder so beware. The music for this is also excellent and diverse. It also uses soundtracks from other Type-Moon properties like F/SN and KNK. I give this game a 5/5. A good game to play on the go."
Luck depenant
"I love FGO. The story is great, the characters are great! Been playing for 4 years, it's fantastic!"
It's alright game
"It's fun, there's waifus, and it's free! (as long as you have a head on your shoulders)"
Get a Chinese tablet. Best FGO gaming experience in mobile.
I've played since release. Updated to play the new event and it's crashing constantly. It's literally unplayable. On an S20+ for hardware info. I'll change the rating and review once this issue is fixed.
Best game everr
Hehe
Great game and I love gamba
Who need's a girlfriend when you can have waifus. ‚âß‚ùõÃÄ‚ÄØ·¥ó ÃÅ‚ùõ‚â¶
guys I know you watch beyblade burst but here's a five star
Gacha rates could have been better.
"FGO has a great storyline, cool characters and a nice soundtrack. Playing it is like being the main character in a visual novel with battle segments when you get your summoned servants to do the dirty work in battle. It can be a very personalised game depending on how you raise your summoned servants, but for me personallly all of the good stuff ends right there. The grinding in this game is tiring, events are super long winded and require lots of time/ dedication. Gacha rates are a sinkhole."
"Mechanics are easy enough to understand with more depth than you might expect. Nobody beats fate in terms of waifus, but make sure you can keep a lid on your spending or the gacha WILL ruin you."
fan since fate stay night
The boss battles are amazing
hot png anime waifus...
As a fate grand order fan I love this game so much
Amazing...low good unit drop..but actually a lot of 3 stars have amazing attack animations and most of then dont feel generic
"Waifu PNG's go Brrrrrrr It's a good game though, story starts badly and stays that way for a while but once it picks up it's one of if not the best story you've seen available on a mobile device"
It a fun game to wase time and efforts so just have fun üòä
Well... My Wallet is gonna Hurt from this One.
"Game keeps crashing, please fix it. I personally like the game, but the game keeps on crashing on the Android so I can't finish quests."
"Overall its pretty fun. - Interesting characters, beautiful designs, great voice acting, waifus etc are what make this game. - (Early) Main story is a little weak, but has some fun characters, late story is much stronger. - Gameplay is not exciting but has a decent level of tactics involved for tough missions. - Gacha rates and drops of needed materials for power ups are both very very bad. Would give 4.5/5 if possible. Massive amount of content now for new players ( some meh, lots good)."
SHOOTING AND STABBING NAVEL. BLUED AND GRINDR APPS FOR SINGLE AND FUN.
"This game is made for those who enjoy a good story. For those who DO NOT read the story while playing, they wouldn't enjoy the game. The game also has a dated combat system that needs improving. The account binding is perhaps the most glaring issue because you can only have one active account per device and to transfer account data, you need to get a code in-game and then use it on your new device, which most gachas moved away from. Lastly, game crashes periodically after recent updates. Fix it"

BORING
Goodah
Gacha gameüíÄüíÄ
Developers really knows how to get players huh?üòè
Since last update game keeps freezing and crashing.
"Great story, merciless gacha."
Good game but hard to get any character above 3 stars
"This game appears in most games i used to play (ads), maybe if you guys aren't the same as ea (p2w elements of the game is excesive) then you guys would have more people playing your game"
Railroads you for at least half an hour... Some of the characters are likable but for the most part they are lackluster and unoriginal. Bad gacha rates as per usual.
"Great ongoing story, characters, voiceovers, visuals and mechanics. I have been playing since launch and have spent an embarassing amount of money throughout the years because I do want to support the game, but the crashes and freezing have made it unplayable. I want to keep playing to eventually experience what the JP version has received, but it looks like I'm just going to end up saving money not playing."
Great game. Lostbelt 5 gave me existential crisis.
Gamers
Doesn't even work. I can't get pass the title screen before it force closes ü§®üò°
Cute servants.
Pain
A game that offers no mercy and pity among mortal men
"I wasn't too impressed with this game to be honest. I dislike the card system to attack, and the rng behind getting the cards you want. Being forced to pick a support to start the quest is annoying as most supports are way above your level as you progress the story, so you either have to hope to find some semi useless support to have any semblance of challenge, or just 1 shot everything. Meh. Gacha system is saturated with equipment, making it hard to pull characters."
"I cannot log in to the game if I am using the wifi , last time I can play but now I can't please fix this problem I'm a fan of this game ASAP"
Always lags and error Im using a brand new samsung gaalaxy s21
Won't stop giving me they're ads
i like this
I really enjoy playing this Game but lately I haven't been able to play to the game continuously Crashing. I hope in the next Update this is Resolved.
I love the game and I really enjoy it but recently it's been crashing and not letting me log in I cleared both data and cache but nothing I'm scared to delete it because of don't want my account to be gone
Its online but good game üòë
I love this game but since last update i can't even finish a stage without the game crashing. I had to start the app over and over just to spend my AP. Pls fix it
Fun experience. It can be rocky but they give free to play players a bone and some events you get a 100% gaurnete seversnt if you pay. Plenty of ways to get Saint squarts to roll banners.
"The Game's Story and Gameplay are great, however the Loading and lag during cutscenes and Fights could be fixed but other than that the game is a overall great game"
üòáüçøü•ûüå°Ô∏èüíü
"It was an amazing. Yes, the grind rolls may be mad, but the upgrading system is very generous, you can grind Palingenesis to make even a 1 star into a 6 star with bare effort and they are so strong you can carry yourself to endgame yourself with it. Cosmetics tend to cite more for endgame players once they accumulate tons of resources. This game is made to enjoy with simplicity and elegance of old era gachas. P.S When is Ushiwakamaru's Animation Update Coming and why are there two Lancer CuChas"
Liked the game but the constant black screen and screen freeze just kept bothering me im uninstalling this for the mean time please fix it thanks
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏Å
Everytime I load the game it keeps saying that I don't have WiFi and need to restart the application. Pls fix it
Hiiiii ibniiiI jj jjjii8jj kunin b tv
Nvm I don't take it
It keeps crashing out of nowhere
Is that offline or online game!?
"Ill say it. A lot of reviews are quite unfair, but the gacha is horrific, the pity system they added on JP is basically a myth. And apparently characters from JP which make their way to NA sometimes do not get added in properly. For example, NA kiara has the strength of a noodle, but in JP she is quite deadly due to the NA team adding her skills in incorrectly and never fixing the problem. Othet issue is the story starts good but becomes an abomination real fast around 1.5 area, super hit n mis"
You know what just add a claim all button im tired of claiming the mission reward one by one
Way too repetitive and the rates are the worst I have ever seen in gacha.
Keeps freaking crashing everytime. I can't get past beyond the title screen because it keeps on crashing.
"I love this game, best gacha game, give me the best gacha experience"
Its so long to load i dont like it you need so much resouresses and its way way to long
I love the way it keeps updating. It's really fun. Thanks for the great game!
One of the best gacha games if not the best in terms of story and and though its gameplay Is a little outdated it is still very fun
Rate up is a lie but goodüóøüëç
The mommy game ‚Ñ¢
"Good game, but some updates make it crash nonstop."
Just don't.....
"I love the Fate series, and this is pretty much the only game on my phone. But, now it just freezes and crashes either in a battle or while trying to load in."
"Great game, Epic story with agonizing gacha and drop rate"
finally available in latin america
Crashes constantly.
"Game glitches out and I try to reinstall and use my data transfer number, but it doesn't work. Just lost all progress."
"So, the game ran fine... until I used a support Gilgamesh. ANY attacks with him crash the game on my brand new Samsung S22. Which is completely unacceptable, even my piece of trash computer with an emulator doesn't crash like that running the game!"
How do I recover an account I've lost I don't have any of the old info I used
Too much for a tutorial.
"nice..üëçüëç I can learn about world history from this game, although it's not as original as the original world history, but it's quite fun to learn through a game"
I really liked this game. But after losing my save data 3 different times I'm no longer going to come back to this game. Maybe if yall fixed it but I just lost almost 8 years worth of data so count me out.
"Best gatcha there is, good for casual and competitive , dissapointed in the once in a lifetime costumes and servants, new players will never be able to obtain in the future"
As of recent update the app crashes upon attempting to login. White screen then a pop up asking to close the app cuz it isn't responding. Unplayable. I don't recommend the app as it is right now especially since so much time is needed to play the MSQ and with all the recent hangs and crashes since the castoria release.
10/10 would go broke again
"Crashes so much, it's basically unplayable. UN. PLAYABLE."
Never mind is fun and cool i played it 3 mins ago and is fun
Pld add english voicelines for all characters i am interested thank you
No kama
Have been playing for over two years now and it's easily my favourite game. Thanks for adding it to the Brazilian PlayStore!!!
"I really love this game for the story and the events The only problem is the time, this game is time consuming and you have to be patient to farm the mats to lvl up your servants"
This freaking game is disturbing
Game is crashing so much it is unplayable.
I hear it's good but I can't get over all the men of history getting turned into waifu girls and all the spirits that are not fighters while legends like admiral yi and Hannibal of Carthage don't appear.
At last he is back
Constantly redownloading the app just to play it can be a bit tedious. The fact that it occasionally lags during a fight and takes a few minutes for the animation to load. However I‚Äôm not saying that I don't enjoy the game. It's simple and fun but I hope they can actually fix the issue.
Great game to play when it isn't crashing constantly. Starting the game and going through most of the menus are works fine. But the moment you try to load into a battle game crashes. Please fix this asap!
Very nice game
"You can not play or access any current event without having beaten the entire story, which takes weeks and longer. Extremely unfriendly for new players, and they don't give you much to begin with. You only really come here for Fate and not to experience a new player friendly game."
"Love the game but please fix the crash issue, cant get past the loading screen"
"terrible starter pulls, horrible start up, extremely slow tutorial, lack of voice acting & extremely stingy game for newbies to pickup and start. The first pulls you get in the game arent even free they cost your tutorial funds. If you want to delete your account you have to go through a whole process & wait till the devs get back to you on that. Seriously horrible scammy game, worst anime mobile game i ever played by far"
My historical figures / gods can't be this sexy.
Game is unplayable. Can't even complete the tutorial without ot freezing as soon as it shows you how to do a chain attack.
Manage to got 2 Artoria's Variants but not manage enough to get Castoria:(
"Despite the beauty and love of this game, the device despite being a compatible device looks like it wasn't made for it, gacha is good but disconnect during battle is worst because of lag, tried doing everything and nothing, this lag cant be fixed"
The game doesn't make it past the load screen. Can we fix this for Android users?
Wow
"I give 1 star because there is to much loading page being seen than the game, and it's better to make it an MMORPG GAME than just clicking the character cards it's kinda boring game, it's sucksüòí"
The game is good but its a shame that events require some endgame stage requirements
I don't want this game
"Good story, great characters, great voice acting. Slow, boring and very outdated gameplay and of the worse gacha rates. It's a 7 year old game with minimum effort in improving."
Best Gacha
I'm playing this game on an Samsung Android phone and it is crashing and freezing constantly. Please fix this issue.
Not good
"The Gameplay is really good but be careful when you're gonna update the game because I lost all my data when update and couldn't recover my account, You gotta need a backup or transfer number to get it back"
ITS FINALLY AVAILABLE IN ITALYY
best gacha game of all time
A very good game it doesn't lag or anything the gacha is good and getting character in this game is kinda easy I'm and F2P btw that's all hoping to stick at this game forever! :D
Why is. It sp hard to get crystala in game its literally pay 2 win
Japanese Anime location
"Love/Hate relationship with the Gacha but carried by the story, characters & lore."
"Can't even play the game. I finish the tutorial and I just get stuck in a white screen and crash shortly after. Tried reinstalling and going through the internet, attempting to fix it and no luck. It will stay 1 star until something is done about it. That's rather unfortunate... i was really looking forwards to playing this game, i was so excited.."
Based
Hoping for a Collab with other anime. Keep it up!
Awesome but need higher servants rates amd sq
Fate Grand Order
Basta maotüòè
It crashes a lot
Best game of you want to go to hell
Cool. Buat no cool gacha
Never been more in debt in my life before
I don't know about this but when i downloaded it and opened it it keeps on loading and loading it also says because of my wifi connection i checked my wifi and i saw that it had an strong connection i tried it on my other apps and it worked i tried it this time again and it says again that it because my WiFi is low or not connected i tried it over and over again and it still won't work pls fox this
It's a good game personally I love it. And it's a summoning game and I for some reason love summoning games.
"Good game, don't recommend it"
"I'm playing this game about 4 years, at the beginning story was niche but with time it develops into full epic."
"Great game amazing story horrible gacha rates, rate up is a lie"
As much as I love this game the crashing is what kills it for me :c
Solid game I'm not so match a fanatic of fate series but yeah solid game even if the game is 5 years old
"Immersive Story, Easy to learn gameplay, iconic characters, Rewarding Events, It doesn't follow the AFK rule which most gachas have. This makes it into an actual playable game instead of one of those games where it just makes you watch the screen due to auto mechanics You don't need to spend money as the game gives you very strong welfares for free as long as you do events. Battles can be beaten with proper setup. You don't even need to have high rarity units. You just have to pay attention."
Responsive support when recovering my account. I'm thankful to them and i can play again despite gacha hell ahahahha
This game is unplayable I'm stuck in the loading screen even though my wifi is good
Fun love the anime
"Good game, ARC IN 2 YEARS"
Crashes everyday without fail
MAN I HATE THIS GAME 5 STARS ILL CONTINUE PLAYING
"Granblue is way better, just sayin."
Game was hacked through a third party somehow beyond my comprehension. I lost my account and they will not do anything to help me get it back. Couple thousand dollars down the drain no biggie. I would suggest not playing this game and play something else.
"The game is great. It has solid plot for the story, the gameplay is also simple and user friendly. The only thing that is barring me for giving the app a 5 star rating is that, the farming of materials, both skill up and ascension, is very time consuming and difficult. Some mats can only be obtained in high level instances. But without those mats, we can't strengthen our Servants to proceed to higher level. Please fix these"
Lovely
After the anniversary the game been acting cheap with its saint quatz the daily login rewards are bad
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏≠‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏¢
I was playing this game 2 years ago cause my bro and cousin recommend me to it but I uninstall it because I really don't play gacha games back in the days but I came back this july and amidst of it I was having fun and the story are the most interesting (F2p player here) i really regret it uninstalling this in those days....
Can't believe i downloaded a fate game just bcuz of an anime girl
Playing for 5 year
"Thanks to paid gachas in this game,Its disappointed me free currencies to use pulls is useless in paid banners with guaranteed 5*servant."
have been a huge fan of fgo for 4 years. I have CN account and JP account and finally you supported UK! Congrats on 7th anniversary in JP! Hope we can see a happy ending after 2.7. „Çà„Çç„Åó„Åè„ÅäÈ°ò„ÅÑ„Åó„Åæ„ÅôÔºÅ

Stop Your Damn Ads Dude I Won't Download It This Sucks So Much
Why can't i play the game it always says an error has occurred is it a bug Because if it's a bug pls fix it
In the ads it looks so good but the game grapics is bad
Spent about $300 on the game because its a genuinely good game. But the company doesnt cloud save your data like other games and my old android stopped working so now I cant recover the account and I had too many heros that I cant recall everyone my account had maxed out.
Great game. Been playing for 5 years but I'm getting a bug with my castoria where if she even uses one of her skills the game crashes. Plz help I don't want to miss the ooku rerun
Thank you Lasa√±aGod
"Excellent gameplay and character depth, story telling is one of the bests right now"
While I do think this game's story is probably one of (if not) the best stories available to play on a mobile phone there are still flaws in the game the main 3 that I can see is 1. Low chances for a 5* and there's no pity system currently but even in the future that pity system is still very much lacking 2. There's not much variety in gameplay it's just 1 gamemode and nothing else. 3. There's not much in quality of life features. While there are probably more these are the most apparent for me.
Rates are terrible. Have lost my sanity already playing this game. 10/10 would spend 1500sq again.
"Great story, Great characters, Great art and visuals I do not reccomend playing this game. Possibly the worst gacha system compared to most gachas(fgo since 1st month and a near decade playing gachas worth of experience) to the point where you could spend over ¬£1000 and still not get the unit you want; crushing your desire to play the game.One of the best stories in any medium and some of the most loveable characters in fiction only for you to sink ¬£400 and recieving salmonman. Yay."
Love FGO
Very grindy i no longer care about its story but here to stay for waifus Auto-farm when?
Love this game! It's alot of fun and I'm a huge fan of fate! Plus I got my fav charecter Gilgamesh so that's a plus! It has alot to improve on but I'm loving the game so far I hope they continue adding and improving the content to come üî•
I can finally play this game properly
Love it!
Waifu war
"I really enjoy this game. i find the story interesting and the battles easy to understand. My only complaint is that there's no log on, and if you loose your phone it's hard to recover your account. I think anything that has in app purchases should have a log on not linked to a single device."
Bad gacha tbh
I really like this game
The game is glorious meow
"With the recent updates, grinding has become more efficient at the Chaldea gate. Still, would like to see something that would improve efficiency for grinding for skill rank up materials."
I personally hate this game.
Ganda
"Esse jogo √© uma bomba, Nota 5."
"The story iself is worth it, even if you dont like gacha or anime. They also finally made the app aviable for European users, I dont need to use a vpn anymore to play"
Fixed!
Been playing for about 3 years. Really happy it's finally on the UK app store. Its both challenging and fun with alot of free rewards :)
Don't cash in pls
fgo is fun and exciting game and have many waifus
Fate grand order was nice to play in the beginning.it was fun to play and get servants that you can talk to in your room but as I continued to fix the singularities and the moving on to the other differents one as well I learned that it will hard and painful for the players(us) to no and try not to cry once we realized that in order to fix them.over all it is a nice game to play
I really love this game and please be generous in the next banner‚ù§Ô∏è
Grind grind grind grind
Pretty nice ngl
"It's a great game but i wish you could bind your account, i just accidentally deleted my app and now i have wait to see if they will give it back.. It sucks I'm in the middle of the casino event too.. ugh Edit: In spite of me not having much knowledge of my account details they still found a way to help me get my account back, therefore i changed my rating, thanks guys!!"
YOUR GACHA RATE UP IS A LIE
This game is my life
"Waifu simulator go brr, glad it's finally available in UK"
"Bad rates, outdated gameplay, great anniversary rewards, carried by story 10/10 would not recomend"
"Great game, but will freeze up and crash sometimes. A lot of characters to obtain and level. Fun cut scenes, good strategy game."
Honestly its just fine nothing more nothing less wrote the book
Thanks for creating Okita!
Surprise me
It's Fate... And the game 10/10 and .
Swiched phones transfer data failed lost account no google play option to recover it took them a long time to get back by email but they got me back in. Bugs out once in a while but a very fun game an latest update is bugging out again an won't install only solution is to uninstall an hope it reloads my data. Won't let me back in
"I hate this game! I had to play through the whole story line relying on somebody else's character to get through missions. Why you ask because the summoning is absolutely useless, I summoned for a character with 300 saint quartz and didn't get anything. It took me a week to get that amount to get nothing in return."
"The game play is meh, but the story and Lore is amazing few time I Cried through the first journey, but hmm . . . . . . . . . I disappointed of myself how I drop playing this game when it first came to US. I only come back continue where I left off after seeing the anime. And once again how I am disappointed how the anime didn't follow the game storyline. Soo the Visual Novel game of Fate grand ordee storyline is way better than the anime storyline"
"I like it sofar, the gacha is merciful to me so far... so far. I uhh... so i uh changed it from 5 stars to 4 stars because i cant get the 5 star saber i wanted only 4 star lancer... i dont need lancers. If it was a 4 star of another class like maybe a saber i wouldnt really mind ya know, so ye $100+ down and bad gacha, overall pretty good game just dont rely on your luck."
Because its laggy
Jack B. has broken roll tables.
My experience so for has been amazing. I know some won't have the awesome time I have so far but what I will say is that you do need to spend money if you want to have a great time playing this game and don't be too reckless with your money and be bothered not having the gold servants as begin to play the game. Just enjoy your time and if you feel like donating the gatcha banners aren't that bad either.
My favorite franchise. The story is really well written after the first 3 singularities. A lot of events with good comic relief to take away the pain from the main story even if just a little. Graphic wise is amazing and each character is unique. Very hard grind but worth it at the end. Like all gacha is a hell of his own but I like this hell a lot. Highly recommend.
"First off I love this game and anyone looking for a fate/anime game go for it. But that dose not mean it doesn't have its problems. First is a gacha game and you need to know that. While is gives you plenty of fee curancy from completing the story and free quest as well as weekly challenges, it often takes a stupid amount of saint quartz (the main currency) to roll for the heros you want and that is my only real gripe about the game other than the grind or materials and the here and there bugs"
gacha pain
Love this game just wish there was a way to save your game progress so if something happened and had to reinstall the game you don't have to start all over and lose all your characters and stuff.
Well they fix the crash issue
I got ssr so i rate 5star XD
I play gacha for the jpegs and I do like them jpegs
I've played the Japanese version of this game since day 1. I have no regrets. The graphics and animations for each character are amazing. The story is incredible. This game isn't pay to win... It's Pay to Waifu. Every character is viable in their own way. Please don't spend on gacha.
Coshocton dispel
Still the best mobile game imo. Lovable characters combined with unparalleled lore among mobile/gacha games. Animations have improved so much as well!
Love the work on the strategic planning and execution of a plethora of combos. No one servant stands alone. Luck is terrible.
Awesome but laggs a lot especially the tutorial. Could battling become offline since the game is played solo.
"i like the animation, it just ain't my gameplay style maybe of how they fight"
Good in rpg
"I got 2 gilgamesh, 5 star worth. - 2021 I got NP3 Gilgamesh - 2022"
"Rate up is a lie..... But aside from that, pretty good game with a great history and good character design"
This game is very good ngl the only thing that frustrates me is saint quartz grinding
Rin faces
As a F2P player you need a lot of grind in this i think
"It isn't compatible with my device, please make it available on more devices."
I love the game the graphics and pls can you please give me ozymandias
Best gacha game ever. Some may fall and die but I will thrive in all the salt that is to come.
"They messed up the gacha rate for a banner, and no compensation at all. Totally ridiculous. It makes you think if they had already done this intentionally on other banners previously."
Update are long and boring
"Can't play because after unlocking (from simlock) my phone when i downloaded it again, it wont open and redirects me to gmail to send a email to the support team of the game to send the error, pls fix this error. It was working fine before this, i need my ishtar back."
The games is good but sometimes when summoning the game stops and the only promlem is my luck sucks at gacha games
I love it.... What are the chances that gilgamesh[Prototype] will be in the game?
Love this game üßÇ
STOP WITH YOUR STUPID ADS
"Low gacha rate, no pity system, and scam Dantes gacha. Outdated gameplay. No binding account system. üëéüëéüëé"
Been playing since GudaGuda 1. Glad that it came to EU. I wish however the performance and other more Quality of Life Improvements would come to FGO such as a better transfer system
It looks like isn't working
"Still boring, boring events but good waifus, bad rates though"
i hate the way in loading section too slow
"Continues to have fun and silly events years in and the writing and jokes are always enjoyable. Also, ALWAYS make a copy of your transfer codes!!"
"Its a shame the story is good. I WANT to like this game, i really do. But after playing for 2 plus years i can safely say this game is just a long boring grind. Im not motivated to want to grind. Its horrible. They clearly want you to spend money and even if you do. You STILL have to grind so much to level your servants. To level up their skills. To get their ascension materials. Your gonna grind for HOURS to get a few levels. Regardless if you paid or not. This game does not respect your time."
sus
awesome
"FGO, is a super fun and interesting game for anime fans and history buffs alike. Like, even if you are not fond of anime, the historical figures they play around with is so cool. The gameplay is a turn based system that has a really cool three attack variant where every little statistic can influence your rounds be it order of cards or knowing when to use abilities. The story is ny fav part; it starts off kinda ""meh"" but really picks. I have not had issues with crashing but idk :P. My phone old"
This game is so good
Crashing stopped
Honestly I love the game but it's been crashing on main missions so regularly that I can't catch up so it's completely unplayable
"Very good game if you like the Fate universe. Spend reasonably, because the gacha temptations are hard to resist"
Don't play it please. Don't make my mistake. I'm a slave.
Please update for Android 9
I can't install
Just crashes all the time. S10e user. Shame. Well the battle system is average card based a fair and the animation is a choppy 30... So no point coming back with the other gacha available
"Art is stunning, story ranges from the sublime to the absurd. I have to downgrade it to 3 stars because while there have been many QOL upgrades recently, the fights that aren't trivial are utterly unfair and unbalanced. The summon rate is still utterly abysmal in a very competitive market. A mercy rule or a progressive chance improvement would get it to 5 stars, but for 5 years and counting, they demonstrate that they just don't care."
W game
Le pongo 5 estrellas.
"Last event was good, story, gameplay charecters, all 10/10"
Best sleeping pill
"If you like a good visual novel-type story, simple battle mechanics (that can sometimes actually lead to so really hard battles), n8celly paced events, great characters, and great artwork, you might really enjoy this game. And if you're a fate fan, even better, enjoy the wild ride."
"The game is awesome been playing for years. Friendly gacha ""haha hell no"" but still even with weak character ya can play like for fun."
"Great story, plenty of amazing servants, quests that help boost a servant's abilities/attributes (varies by individual servant). Seasonal events and returning events adding even more story, adding characters from other parts of the Fate series. It gets wild."
The game is good but... too much pay for win (ofc is a gacha game)
"When the Tsukihime collaboration event releases then I'll give this game it's last star. Edit: They did it, well done."
Gacha has been good to me :)
Ya est√° en M√©xico 7u7
I love this game. Been around for 4 years.
Lost to 50/50 twice on castria banner lame rate up
"better than expected, but have to get starter account"
Been playing for 4 years now. Only recently has the game started crashing every 3 minutes
"I've been playing fgo for around four years now and maybe I spent two years of it to sulk and never open the app for months cuz sometimes I spent a lot of sq and never got the servant that I wanted lol. But, besides that, almost everything is wonderful. I love the story, the characters, and literally almost everything (besides the gacha rate ofc). Maybe some people think this game has a really basic gameplay, but I still enjoy it nonetheless. It depends on the person, actually."
Se siente raro poder descargar este juego sin necesidad de nunca m√°s usar una vpn
Unplayable in EU the games crashes as soon as a heavy attack animation plays
"Good rpg, needs a steam port. Mordred Supremecy."
I dont really like card games but this game made me like it. Nice waifus and great story and also waifus
"Great story, meh gameplay and cool characters. Will cost a lot to get specific characters, but not a lot to get enough"
"The stories and plot lines of FGO are incredibly compelling. The game play is pretty straight forward, utilizing a turn-based battle system. You collect heroes from history and folklore via a gacha and strengthen them via farming materials. The gacha rate is poor, with only a 1% chance to draw the most rate heroes; this is low compared to other games like granblue fantasy, and there is no mechanic to ensure you receive at least 1 rare hero in every 100 draws. I still play 5 years in."
i sold my soul for the gacha. it gave me waver.
Awesome!!!!
fun challenge
i l yum
LOVE IT!!!
Nice stuff
I can't download anymore üò≠
Story üëç Gameplay üëé Basically i only play it as a VN and not a game anymore EDIT: they are now trying to innovate which is good. It would also depend on your servants but its a gacha game anyway
i do enjoy playing this game and its so thrilling to discover more character in this game i hope the developer will make the graphics more epic even though the animation is still amazing
Amazing game would gamble again

The game has improved a lot since it's release and becams a really good game. The only problem is there is no skip for quest or there is no way to farm fast.
Recent frequent intermittent crashes are due to Android webview library issues or how FGO/Unity client uses it. Restart the phone usually fix it.
"5/5 will never recommend. It's Gacha hell, horrible mat drop rates, barely functioning boring gameplay, you should only come for the wonderful story and community and roll expecting absolutely nothing."
Dont mind me im just an fgo addict
"I've been enjoying it so far. The gameplay is very simple and repetitive but I really enjoyed the story. Just some suggestion old servants like Gilgamesh (Archer) and Arjuna needs revamps and buffs since more strong servants are coming in the near future. Also a pity system or a rate up would be good too, it took me three months just to get 1 SSR."
Sex
falling asleep while farming in this game is normal
Sc√°thach simp
"New servents hype good gameplay as usual Problem in lagging, could be my phone who knows Also some guy blabbing about diversity on the reviews, this games probably has the most diverse cast of character there is. He's dumb and old"
Every update makes the game better. I hope the 2 years gap from the JP server will shorten so that we can get the stuffs earlier
Sound issues.
"The game isn't bad and the characters' graphics and effects are cool. The game has a lot of quality of life issues for me. There isn't a collect all button for achievement quests, speech blocks the accept button sometimes, and killed enemies only go away if you switch character attacks to name a few."
"I like this game a lot. Of course, it's gacha but I feel they give nice rewards for f2p players. The story is amazing and worth reading."
I really enjoyed this game. The story and visual design is great. The gacha rate is very low for 5* and 4* but by saving up sq i rolled many times and got plenty of those servants. One thing im worried about is losing my data and i wish you were able to link ur google play account to it rather than obtaining a transfer number.
"Great story and characters, addictive gameplay loop, and fun overall, crashing has stopped for my device as well"
Give me 5 copies of all my favorite jpegs. Edit: now I need 6 copies
Worst gacha rates I've ever seen
"Not a good game to spend money on 'cause It would make you bankrupted with terrible gacha rate. Not friendly for busy player since most of the events request certain storyline milestones, not to mention the requirements of specific skills and servant type to reach further stage in event. Salty enough but I would recommended FGO merchandises, novels, animes,...over the games itself."
I've been playing since 2020 and I'm so happy it's been expanded to the UK!
this is gooddds
Been playing this for years. The story is on a league of its on if compared to other phone games. The gameplay is simple yet fun. The updates are always intresting and i plan on playing this for years to come!
this game is probably one of the best games I've played the concept of the game is amazing the details it's all amazing plus I love the anime Fate series so I love it very very much.
Fun on a bun
"Fun game, I wish it caught up to the jp version eventually though."
DW sucks Lasengle good üëçüòä
Pls gib me tomoe

"Very rewarding if you put in the work, that being said, it's a lot of grinding"
SSR and SR drops are the most rare thing and the gatcha system will drain your life other than that pretty good
edit: nvm i got skadi im chill now lmao edit 2: now also got castoria GOTY of every year actually
New year new account new servants Thats the best way to play FGO Oh yeah and Im waiting for Fairy Knight Gawain aka Barghest to come to global!
"i hate this game, $1000 dollars and counting down the drain"
I really enjoy the story and seeing my favourite fate characters again :)
Im addicted please help
Fun game. Horrible gacha
I've played this game through another account for years and ive loved it through it all.
"Obra maestra del gacha, saludos a F/GO LH&T"
Fun game great story pretty generous in the welfare units gatcha is hell but we are getting pity in 2 year maybe even sooner on na
7 YEARS it took you hahaha
I relly love this game is funny and Challenging will when your in the Lost belt numbers 5 but other than that is Funny keep it up
"An excellent game, f2p friendly if you have a brain and easier to get into than most gachas"
I hate you're adsü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢üòæüòæüòæüòæüòæ
Great game. The art and character design is fantastic.
"Gib SQs Joking aside, the gameplay is great and the story is top tier. Way way better what the dish out on major gaming consoles. This game has a way rewarding gacha compared Gaming scams like diablo immortal."
Please add a pity system every banner cause it's somewhat hard to know if you gonna get the feat. SSR Character or lose a large amount of SQ still not getting the feat. Charcacter. Over all its good but it lacks a pity system
The game is simple but amazing like the team building and planing that goes in to each battle. The frequency of events are good but I do wish they did older events more often. Lastly I would like more interaction with your servants as well as somewhere to study your enemies in game a not just the wiki
help
"The writing and characters can be fun, but the game is stingy and tedious, with no way to auto combat so you don't have to pay attention to easy encounters, and the game has a tendency to crash nonstop, especially frustrating during the tail end of an event, making it so you can't get the rewards you were working towards."
Gacha is hell but the story easely carries itself A must play for fate fans
"Besides being one of the best Gacha games ever made in history, This is a Unique Game. It has a wonderful storyline and great character design, in addition to beautiful animations. If you like myths and history like me, then try this game. I'm sure you'll love it.Ô∏èüòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
i love history
Total Kiara simp
I like it but it crashes a lot and that is a huge turnoff for me so I'm moving on to a real game
game garbage
Current update crashes way too often no matter what I try.
For some reason the game will freeze or straight up just close out.
I really appreciate this game because it's so nice üòä and i really really love it.......
Game so slow and no free summons it's a pay to summon game. Really sucks man loading too much and I can't play it properly it's taking a while to load for a single command.
POGGERS
It should be on steam
The Game has Many Tutorials!.. That took all of my time... also too many introductions of characters... its annoying...
I love this I want this we need this in HELL TRASH CAN
great game but the transfer data has to change to like standard transfer like Google play account or smth
When I first saw this game i just ignore it but when I try it i didn't know this game was too cool. But the only i hate is the storage i really like it. the graphics? Too good! I'll rate this 5 start because i like it. I have no regrets playing this
"I played for a few day. The game is nicely made with detailed story, but its just really boring."
Not bad at all just feel like it should be a bit easier to get quartz bc sometimes I find it hard to even spin for a character without daily rewards or having to make a whole new account just to get free 30 quartz
maganga cte u ilobvr u ulol lol 2530
There has no way to play this game. I do Installl and Uninstall several times
"*UPDATE* I love playing this game, wish there were more deals on quartz, ignoring that however, it's beautiful WHEN it works. However almost every month the game just crashes where i can't even log in let alone start a battle. When an event is happening losing 3 days really hurts"
I am so sowwi Pls forgwib me ;-;
This game have everything I'm expecting in a rpg
Keeps crashing on my note 20 ultra... Anyone else have this issue?
Undeserving of any purchases.
I love this game because it has a cool animation and I love the characters is specialy the character emiya but it has an long loading
"The game is good , The only problem here is the game is sudden freezing for 2-3 seconds when I'm playing quest and events ,please fix this dev"
"Intuitve controls and easy to understand. While the story is somehow a hit-and-miss for me since I am not a fan of the Fate series, it will keep those die-hard fans salivating the many references this game provides. üòÉ If only this game has an easier way of saving your progress. The password transfer system is super archaic and antiquated to the point of frustration..."
Game used to be great but it keeps crashing.
Nice game its good for f2p like me
Sucks when u can't pull what you want
Keeps cutting out and kicking me out
Since the new update the game keeps crashing every 5 mins Super frustrating
"Wish we could have servants like Morgan alot faster on the NA server. Gacha rate will bleed you on your favorite gacha servant banner. But the graphics, storyline, and gameplay are top notch for turn based ""card"" game."
The game is good the character are interesting add astolfo
It's fun but be smart with your saints quarts unlike I was
Bro despite the constant crashing and lagging I still pushed through to play and I can safely say this game sucks after 100+ summons I haven't pulled any 4 to 5 star heros this is just a**
It's fun.
"I AM THE BONE OF MY SALT , BLACK KEY IS MY BODY , SODIUM IS MY BLOOD , UNKNOWN TO LUCK , NOT KNOWN TO GACHA , HAVE CRAFTED MANY SR , YET THESE HAND WILL NEVER GET AN SSR , SO AS I PRAY , UNLIMTED SALT WORKS ..."
The game itself Is brilliant... the in currency seemes extremely expensive in AU dollars... which stops the game being 5 stars
"The gameplay and story is enjoyable. But there's a bug, when you already choose the male character mc you will still see female mc in some conversation/cutscenes and sometimes in battle even though my mc is a male character."
To those Critics saying the app crashes. Just get a new and better phone LMAO. If you can afford whaling for your Waifu then you can afford another phone. If you can't then sucks to be you LoL. The game is perfect just the way it is.
"I was syced for this game, too bad it requires internet and to know your location"
"Playing on Galaxy S22 Ultra with latest Android update, can't get through first Seraph battle due to crashing. Constant crashing even after reinstalls and phone restarts, downloading additional data, nothing helps. Edit: Android updated and game is working normally again. Edit2: Back to crashing on the title screen this time. Push out that engine update already guys."
Application is functioning as expected after a system restart.
Great when you can play it. Every update adds more freezes and crashes that never seem to get fixed.
"Grinding is the only thing you be doing, no char select still, well no point wasting space. Besides the story nothing cool or interest to get, the battle system is boring at best. Brand selling only works if you have something solid in the first place and this is not it."
"Game keeps freezing, for me thats a game breaker for me"
"This game is cool and all, but did you know that the Archer class is made up of archers?"
"Game dev are not generous. Worst RNG Boring slow waste of time.pay to win,"
It keeps crashing what is going on??
It's been having trouble connecting to the server I tried to retry connecting it multiple times and restarting it and it still won't connect properly even when I have internet connection please fix this
Good change review
My game has continuously crashed so I can't play events or do anything else.
Crash crash crash crash crash crash crash.
Okay something wrong the gender system this update if i pick boy mc it turn to girl every battle same thing if you girl mc
The game keeps crashing and not letting anyone throw the events at all and it happens at the same point every time. Any help fixing this problem would be grateful to all.
Epik
I know nothing about Fate but I saw Ryougi is in this
There's a event going on right now and i can't even play it the app keeps forcing me out
I'm lazy for 5 star so I make it 3 star but this game is really love it
"Amazing game,amazing story,events and characters. Though my biggest issue is that fgo tends to lag and freeze alot nowadays since ever the game got fullscreen,or maybe something else. Either way please fix the problem fgo. Not even big games tends to lag and freeze on my phone."
good app
the eventual loading or unpleasant lagging every now and then ruins the game experience
unplayable!!! after the latest update I can't even get past the opening screen leaving the game unplayable and my login streak broken :c
I rate this game 3 stars because of the fact that it crashes and lags a bit also as a new player coming to the game yes the log in rewards are nice and all but it seems you don't give too much for new people.
This is good game but I'll give it 4 cause so many ads T_T
"I've played this game for 3 plus years across multiple accounts. Since an update in the first week of July 2022, the game crashes every 2 - 3 minutes making it completely unplayable. I have transferred the account to another device, uninstalled/reinstalled the game, and transferred back. The issue still occurs. Bandi please fix the stability issues."
Pls delete this game its inappropriate and nonsense. I hate to see this as an advertisement in one of my favorite games. It also showed inappropriate pictures through the ad. Pls delete
"Please fix the game asap, I can't even finish loading the tips screen to get into the event map. This has happened for several days already. At this rate I can't even finish the event and get the limited servant"
Cool game
The Game is great i saw this in Ads But i Thought its An Rpg game so i deleted it
"I'm having fun with the game, but when I can't use some servents like gilgamesh(archer) or use most NPs because they cause the game to crash on me it stops being fun real fast. The crashing has gotten worse for me. Fix your game please."
"Why RNGesus is so cruel to me :( , have mercy pls."
"Got Abigail Williams already at my first saints quart summon,idk what my luck is anymore"
rule 34 made them hotter than they really were
Why does this game doesn't have auto battle system?? üòë üòí
Thanks to the fix I can play my favorite app again
Duck your game :)
How are the ads even allowed the character designs on the ads are bruh how is it allowed
This is apear my screen and ads how to stop this ads please tell
A good daily game
Man this game sure is bait . The rate is trash can't even get the 5* on anniversary use all sq and ticket still no 5* and the anniversary banner for payed SQ is also trash why can't you just let the player pick the hero they payed for instead of randomly give 5* unit. If you do it it might help them buy more .

"The game is fun and I love the story modes but lately I've tried to play it doesn't want to load and it Constantly kicking me out the game and crashing and when I type my phone it Instally kicks me out the game, I also tried waiting and logging out and in, it doesn't work"
"I've been absolutely loving the game for past few weeks since I started but Im very disappointed with the summons... for a whole week and a half I've done 6, 11 summons and single ticket sums for male summer event in hopes i get emiya when the dates right and while I'm happy to have got two Lans out of those I've got nothing else out of the summons aside from repeat craft essense and repeat 3star servants, did the abigail one today in hopes itd change my luck and i got fat ceasar. Please fix.."
I love this game but For some reason in most levels it says I'm a different gender from what I actually put down as my gender I hope you fix this soon because I don't want to delete the game an lose all my progress just to re-download it and see if it's fixed thank you.
I just think it's neat! sigurd is also very sexy üòç
I can barely complete a turn before it crashes.
For every dollar everytime this game crashed I'd be a millionaire or a billionaire I would rate a 4 or 5 stars but the game crashes every 5 seconds or 25 seconds.
Game not constantly crashes due to load screens or skill use. Can't even play the game if I wanted to.
Is so good tho it is making me feel good for now
Even the ƒ¢Ms is bopols the game is nice and good to play happy flying
"Great game, its an expansive experience constantly recieving new updates new characters and more. Though most things are locked behind story progression, the story is good so I dont mind it."
I like the animation üíõ
"I like it a lot!! I just started playing and im in love with it, but the loading times are a bit slow and the summoning can get pretty annoying. Other than that everything in this game is top tier to me"
I love this game cause it soo cool and awesome to play!
noob game ever hes gping to ad in my game stupid game
"atrocious gacha rates, extremely grindy"
I'm a fan of the fate series and the shenanigans in the event story but the constant crashing of the game has now stopped me from continuing. Please fix the issue.
doesnt work on android 21 after castoria update
Damn Gatcha games take all your money. I really wish i hadn't just spent my money hoping to get a servant i wanted. Only to be handed alot of hor garbage. I wish i could just delete this app and get my money back. I really wish you could just get what you want but companies only want you to spend 100s of dollars attempting to get what you want only to get it after youve given them your entire bank account.
The game always crashes. Very frustating to play
"What's weird is, I was able to play CODM and Mobile Legends without experiencing any laggy playthrough while Fate won't even budge during combats... Ridiculous."
slavery
Very hot
It crashes for me ToT i want to play so badly... Well maybe I'll try again next time
I dunno what to write but it's definitely an awsome game
Slow start at first but the story gets great later on. As a dolphin I pay a little for SQ at times but 99% of the time I can save up and roll on servants I want thanks to the 2 year NA delay. Overall recommend
Please Fix The Signals
"""It's working, it's working!!!!"" The game now seems to be back to normal! If you're looking for a gacha game consider this one! I've played this game for 5 years, you don't need to spend any money but sure is it tempting.I tho couldn't help myselfüôÉ. May Gacha Jesus bless your summons."
"Ever since the event started the game is super unstable. Freezes, locks up, and crashes frequently"
Constant crashing since the latest update. The game is literally unplayable now.
Gacha system is kinda trash did 130 summon and no 5* only got 4 4* outta the 130 summon please fix your gacha system.
We want estes
"Ever since the game updated, it never loads for me I'm just stuck on a black screen, but can still see the sparkly effects of when I tap."
Did not get Altria Caster
Castoria broke the game literally. I can't play now. Game crashes every single run. Trash game now.
Every few updates make the game unplayable. Because of the recent update ive missed the events cause the app crashes within a minute of opening. I love this game but it's ridiculous I can't even play
Best app ever Notice me pleaseüëã
This game is super fun ^^
"Constant crashes. In gameplay, menu, summoning. Crash caused data to auto clear, now I gotta send another email for a code. Why are you like this Aniplex"
I like the graphics and also this so fun game you can explore and more so download now
"At first the game is simple. But as you progress on the game, the game's great."
EKSUCAIBAAAAA
This suck can i block this so will stop appearing in ads
Click every second üòî
Castoria pretty stonks
Crashes at startup
I can't even do the tutorial it keeps crashing
I wanted to start playing this game and it started crashing during the tutorial üò´
Editing my review entirely because of the most recent update and my serious problem with dealing with the not even remotely helpful support team during the bugs I had been dealing with that made the game completely unplayable
"Please add ""Claim all reward""from Masters misson ""EXTRA"" I'm tired of clicking hundreds of rewards just please add it."
Very slow pacing. Too many dialogue. Just uninstalled it. Below 1 star if possible
pretty good game
"I have had a great time playing the game, just got this account of my laptop and have been playing the game on my phone since release day. great game and I heavily recomend."
Slowest game i ever played. Stewpid
App keeps lagging and crashing on my new s22+ device
"Games keeps crashing after Castoria update. I used to be able to read daily information, summon information, and get the dialogue for when I summon a new servant but now I can't. This sucks as I can't see information on current banners such as when it ends and whether the servant will be added to story banner or not."
This app has been a sort of up and down for me but still has been fun to play although the only sort of problem is the sort of slowing down or freezing during certain servants animations or NP's but besides that the newer updates and features are making this game much more enjoyable to play and there may have been some annoying occurrences it is still a very fun game to play.
"Pros: Great story Nice characters and character arts Excellent voice for characters Cons: Too Grindy Less rewarding Takes a fair amount of time if you read the story and clear the stages Getting high rarity characters is rare even if you are a paid player , so F2P would have problems in the beginning. Events being too short lived for one to do enough farming."
Its pretty good it have really really good graphics i like it
üôÑüòé
it's trash.
"The gacha can be brutal, but the story is fantastic. If you're a fan of the Fate series, you'll love this."
I like Mash.
Gatcha games are terrible when your pull rates are terrible. But since it's the Fate franchise no one cares. Genshin about to put you guys out of the top spot if you dont do something.
Thank u n know you're going to live forever
This is kinda a guilty pleasure of mine. I really like the new update so if they continue in this direction I think that this game has a better shot at being number one.
Cool game.
not bad
Love the game been playing since release but the game always freezes and crashes as soon as I open the game
Thanks for waifu Hatsushika Hokusai‚ô°‚ô°
app hang now. can developer do something
"Great stories, this review will change to a 5 star if they ever figure out the crashing issues.....I can't go more than 2 quests without it crashing. Crashes randomly all the time, even more so when you're using your characters Noble Phantasm.....GET THIS FIXED!!"
I love this game the only thing making it four star is because of pity system my luck is not than bad the pity system really confused me still this is solid s5
I like the story but it's crashing a lot on Android 12...
I cant restore my account and it justs keeps crashing on me. I want my money and time back
THIS GAME IS HELL
"Love the game but please update it immediately, everytime I try to play a mission it keeps crashing all of a sudden during this event."
waste of time. so much error in the game
wow üòØüòØüòØüòØ
The actual app is extremely fun. But it freezes every few seconds making it almost unplayable
Pretty good game but there needs to be an easier method if transferring ones account to other devices.
"While gameplay is kind of fun ang engaging, user interface is confusing and bland as hell, it looks like an interface of a game developed back in the early 2000 thousands, the interface alone is making it kinda boring and makes the experience less exciting"
exeded my expectations very good game i also want an ssr servant (please)...
Been playing it for a few years. It's a great game.
I would rate higher but every time I go to do something it always crashes. It's really annoying and this game seems fun but due to that I can not really play the game. Hopefully this gets patched at some point.
no google bind thats why its shtty
i like this game
Fix the crashing issue. The game is unplayable.
Perlitabarbero
"The game part is fun, but we both know it's waifu bait. Luckily for you there is a huge list of potential waifus for you to choose from."
This game can be infuriating with the summons. But I have been a member of this game since day one and still play frequently.
Great game. Spent lots of time.
All I have to say pay to win.
Gimme castoria and i will rate this 5
Didn't get castoria. No pity system. Stale animation and boring gameplay
"Gameplay gets super boring after a bit. A problem that isn't helped by the lack of an autoplay feature for stages, making events incredibly grindy. The art and story is pretty great, especially later on but the gameplay really bogs it down."
Best phone game
"The game is literally unplayable at the moment with constant crashes. It's getting ridiculous that the game doesn't even work anymore, get your act together aniplex"
It sucks
as simple as it is why's there so many things for a tutorial üíÄ just let us play man ffs
pog castoria get
Nice and nephew
"Very Challenging and has a Great Plot, Storylines, Also has helpful Daily Quests and Extra Quests and Good Events too. Proceeding to a new story gives you more stronger enemies which means you must level yourself and your servants, so Farming is a must."
Recommended for Type Moon fans for casual play during free time and waiting time.
"I love the game and have been playing for about 4 years. There is a lot to do, plenty of characters and tons of events. The character appearances change as you level them up at certain intervals which I think is a nice touch."
"Really good story, good character design but pretty trash rates, trash bosses(sometimes u need to have certain unit to actually beat it),updates are pretty consistent,other than the rates and boss mechanics the game is great overall"
I've liked the fate series since I was introduced to it and am loving the gameplay. Would highly recommend if you like gatcha games and visual novels
Fans of the Fate series will enjoy this app immensely.
"We can now play it in Europe as well. Even though we need to choose a different region to play in, it is an improvement."
I like the story very much
Nice game. Keep it up üôÇ btw more upgrade it's super good
Game keep crashing after update
I like that the game is ad free and overall I enjoy the content and the art.
It's a good game but if your luck is cursed I don't know
5year just for 14 characters 5 star F2P pretty bad for me.
I get cucked on my rolls. Overall good game but I get extremely cucked on my rolls and I worked hard for f2P saint quarts. But that is my bad I should steal money from the old lady at the store then buy saint quarts with my hard earnt monry I just got caught lacking. GG L+Ratio
"Horrible game, didn't hand me the goddamn moon cancer after saving up so much, I don't recommend it if you're planning to get a character out of pity once you couldn't get them after 90, Great game but this is taking a toll on my mental health"
"Game is addicted, but the paid summon is a rip-off."
This game good my 30 gems just for good sevant and it's hard to get a 5star servant pls update with fb account so our account will not be deleted and add pick a 5 star servant and it's not bad and the 5th anniversary add so many 5 star servant
While the game remains unplayable Ill have to give it a low rating. I cant even load a quest without it crashing :/.
Ever since the production company switched this game has been unplayable. It would crash when in battles. Gilgamesh is unusable. And now I can't even get on the game. Is this problem ever going to be resolved?
10/10 would go through hell again
I really love fate series I hope you keep up the good work
Quartz go brrrr
Forgot to make a transfer code on my old phone before I deleted the game on it üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ
"Love this game! It does freeze a bit, although that may be because I have an older model phone. Game is still playable and very fun."
The game itself is Good but the reward system and Gacha roll rate is not good. This game is a Pay to win that it makes f2p players grind more that it took so much time for us. In every banner you can get Saint quartz worth 300+ but still you can't get every banner. This will make you pay so that you can get what you want. Scam
I'm only here cause of memes and doujinshi.
"Love it all, but I'm still complaining how this doesn't have any pity rolls"
"App has become unplayable, closing out before I can do anything. (Playing on Android) please fix as this has caused me to miss out on alot of quests and possible pulls, and items I needed for leveling!"
"Big dog included, cannot pat but at least I can feed it grails to 120"
"a lot of updates atm and idk if that will change, but it's a great game. wonderful storyline, graphics are decent. when you finish the storyline there are events every week, and the characters become very creative the more you see"
The drop rate on this game is so bad that there's a higher chance of me learning telepathy than getting a 5 star servant using more than 500 quarts and 50 tickets.
The Salt Is Real
Updated as of 12th July 2022. My advise is to please find another game rather than wasting time playing this scam game with scam rates. 360 quartz and 36 summon tickets later and only 2 Summer Brunhilde but no Moon Cancer Sessyoin Kiara. I get more craft essences than units which are mediocre and useless. The only good thing saving this game is the storyline/plot and the servant art. Can't wait for the pity counter to happen where I have to use estimated 900 quartz to get the 1 character I want!
"STORY Just what you would expect from the Fate Franchise, that is, awesome MECHANICS nothing special, gets boring, desperately needs qol, manual grinding in 2022 is stupid GACHA probably the worst gacha experience, VERDICT as a long time fan of Fate, I was overjoyed with the release of FGO in English If you're here just for the gacha, there are better games out there"
I love this game.
Best game ever lol. Hope more rerun for nobu
Game bagus
Thanks for Castoria
"The gacha system is so bad and I've been playing for years. Everything saved up gets blown on a million craft essences and like maybe two 4* stars. Funny thing is, I'm actually trying to get a specific 4* star and i pull 60 times only to be rewarded two 4* stars that: 1. Don't have their rate up. 2. Already have and have never used. I'm not asking for much, just half what's being promoted. I'm honestly so glad i stopped spending money on this avaricious gambling mess of a game."
"Integrated 'luck', probably the only thing random is when assigning this 'luck' when first creating an account, the gacha seems like 0.2% but internally has a multiplier which uses the account defined 'luck', don't know how that works exactly (prob. 0.2 * n), you can test it and see it after some time, lucky accounts always will be lucky, unlucky ones will always be unlucky, nice game but still, don't spend money if you think your 'luck' parameter is low, it doesn't affect your luck variable so"
Rate up is a lie üò¢ but I enjoy the gameplay tho
"The pulls are pretty bad, I'll 60 pulls on a event banner and not get a servant or a craft essence which qoutes has a higher chance of dropping. I pull more 5 star and 4 star non banner ce copies then anything."
A nice interesting game to pass time on but also has a great story and REALLY likeable characters. Saving for Muramasa time
m√¥ Ph·∫≠t
"Yep, definitely good"
Its so good game
"Great story, characters and graphics. If you are into Fate, then you will get a lot of enjoyment from this. Be warned the gatcha is brutal. Still an amazing game."
Good ahhahha
No Castoria = 1star and Seppuku
I got ca√ütoria
Gimme Da Vinci!
this is sht
No ssr = 1star
it has been really fun gameplay is awesome the moves are on point and the graphics are really nice but the only problem is that you have to pay for quartz in-game and its really expensive and it just makes you feel like its pay to win but still you could select a support so its fine
Fix the random crashes
"Good game, When is you gonna do collab with grandchase?"
Unplayable after latest update
Actually quite enjoyed the game until recent updates made it not playable due to constant crashing fix it
The games layout is confusing. Everyone keeps trying to reinvent the wheel because they think it will make them famous. It just shows how little they understand about making a truly good game. The characters look nice better then most games. And the battle system is neat but without reading through every skill year swinging wildly. The original rpg format for turn based games is still the best.
This is a great mobile game. devs are constantly adding content and they are very generous with unlocks and freebies. easy and addictive progression. simple gameplay with a surprising amount of depth.
"Nonstop crashing ruins an otherwise good game. Currently running it on a Note 10+ with 200 gb free storage space. It's crazy it worked fine for me until about 2-3 weeks ago and now the game is virtually unplayable. I've tried clearing the cache, uninstalling reinstalling, changing settings etc. Begging Devs to fix the game."
You guys need to fix this crashing issue.
Pesudo Singularity 4 First Knot fightnwith Santa Island Mask is broken. Everytime Mask attack the game just stops. Character idle animations continue but nothing else happens.
Whyyy I always get essence card not even a gold servant card 200 sq but not even a gold servant
i uninstall the game to try to fix the game cause i cant connect to the server after the update. Now I cannot access my old account anymore... how do I retrieve my account
It's been a year daddy i really really miss you. Quandle dingle here.
This Game is great but sometimes the gacha is not going well on me.
Gib castoria ill do it a 5
"Other than the limited time confirmed 5 star characters that can only be paid by saints quartz you buy using real money, great game."
"Virtually unplayable since the anniversary ""celebrations"". Game freezes and crashes mean every single turn requires a game restart"
"F2P playing is fun, just save and ur done Luck based game."
100/100 would play again „Ö† „Ö† also Mash bond 10 ce pspspspps
Great game but no auto makes grinding a chore
This is the best show in the world I watch it all the time
Horrible pull rates in this game how this game is still going on for 5 years is stunning.
Nice graphics and I like the update üôÇüôÇüòäüòäüòÑüòÑ
Updates are making the game unplayable. Crashes have been a lot more frequent lately.
1 star because I failed to roll castoria after multiple attempts and grinding for bond levels. Will put 5 star if I happen to get a miracle yolo and get her. Be nice lasengle :)
"Great game, but can't play because it keeps crashing...."
I now rate this game 5 out of 5 for giving me Altria Caster And Kingprotea
Nice game ‚ù§üíï My sleeping pill üò¥
"Gameplay as it is looks very basic and simple.The characterization, voices and variety of characters are impressive for the most part. Unit balance is done such that all unit rarities are usable. Events offer a ton of variety in gameplay and content. Draw rates are average and saving is very important for desired units. On the other hand, major problems are the lack of a pity system and the extremely long AP/energy/stamina recharge which can take as much as half a day. Story is also done by varying writers which can affect the quality, with some being great (for a mobile game) or somewhat terrible and shallow. Nonetheless, it's a great game for everyone especially for those interested in historical and mythological figures/events."
"I think this company should change game's age restriction to 18+, I have found this game quite inappropriate (especially the attack animations). Some of the characters in the game weren't wearing much clothes, I don't know if they were poor or something (if they are, I feel sorry). So Sony, please change the age restrictions. I don't want to see another young victim of your game. (sorry bro, if there is 0 star.. I will click it without thinking) 1000% for adults(uninstall if you are 18-)"
"Game keeps crashing and I lost my account, so I can't even try to get it back."
"constantly crashing, unplayable."
me when the fgo hemfai
Game is great but the resources are not too good on a f2p players and to a low spender. Hoping you'll improve the daily
App always crashing and freezing that force me to restart due to that issue I couldn't enjoy the game so better uninstall it because i waste my time for nonsense
A waste of time geez. 30 quarts for 10 summon?! And 1sr or four star in those freaking ten summon? Like seriously I've play this for almost a week and I can't even get 1ssr and the limited 5 star your talking about a waste too like seriously not all players have money üôÇ
"Fgo might be older in terms of other gacha games, but the lore and love put into the game through it's story and characters is breathtaking. All the characters stand out one way or another, even mash a servant that you get free has a ton of love put into her. Make no mistake though fgo can be brutal in terms of the rates, I've seen stories you can either get a unit you want in one multi, or 1000 saint quartz later and no SSR. Just be warned if you get into this game you'll get addicted!"
I love fate and by extension grand order but dear god the lag is absurd to a point I find myself waiting 4 minutes to complete one turn because it stutters and freezes for every animation
it's a mess un playable
Can't connect to the game server.
Crashes constantly since last update. Can't even finish a simple daily quest. Game has gone to hell since it changed hands. Do NOT download.

Wow sow meny items and carakter
I will try this game And this is so nice and cute
Issues with the game frequently crashing in battle or summoning. (Found a potential fix) Delete the game and reinstall then once back in your account download all data. (If you do this make sure to create a transfer number to get your account back!!) If they do fix it faster I'll adjust my review. Otherwise a good marathon game to play.
Played since the game came out for NA in 2017. Took a break and came back to a game that doesn't load up without multiple attempts to update the game. The game doesn't load up and will crash. What happened?
"Absolutely love the game. The only problem I have is that it crashes, especially now that its anniversary. I cant run any of the new missions without it crashing. When I use a friends Castoria or any ultimate The game freezes and then closes."
I'm leaving a five star rating because I was able to get Castoria in two multi pulls. Long live Aniplex
FGO FOREVER
"Don't get the game unless you're a big fan of fate. Reasons being is the grind is real and repetitive, the events try to diverse themselves and are honestly pretty fun but it waters down to farming. Not to mention the horrible pull rates, if you want a specific character, you better pray to some godly force you get them, not even 1000sq can guarantee you'll get them. It doesn't help that the summoning pool Is filled with trash craft essences that make it harder to pull anything good. üëé"
Looks like fun if I could get past the tutorial. I just downloaded the game and it crashes during the tutorial fight when they line up 3 of the same cards and the 4th attack starts.
Best game everüòäüòç keep it up
Amazing game but it freezes up and crash's alot for me but overall good game üéØ
This app is the best app i have ever downloaded
"My account can back again, thanks customer service fgo"
"FGO is one of the best game I've played, the mechanics are really simple and original, although leveling up is quite hard and it only gives you +1 of total cost so I suggest maybe make it +2 or +3 but this game is really good so you should totally play it."
Only problem is AP without the fruit it's hard to for us to just wait for half or a day just to play I don't care for other update for me the most important things right now is to make ap have a fast recovery or something.why the developers not listening to those who complains
"I love fate. Any weeb will probably find something to enjoy. Just be careful uninstalling the game. You may end up losing your account, and so far, I got no idea how to get it back."
go kys ü•∫ü•∫
"Would've rated this as 4 or 5 stars, but the latest update has the game constantly and randomly crashing, either during a battle or when selecting a guest servant. Will change when this is fixed."
"A fun game as always and enjoying the anniversary event but.... ever since the most recent update, roughly every minute it crashes or freezes."
"Haven't been able to play since the new update, keeps crashing every time I play."
I cannot open the games becase i forgotten my password
Great solitaire game c:
"there are big bug in game the game will freeze in middle of combat (after pick command card),attacking or when replacing enemies game will crash and close itself (samsung galaxy s10+) it never being like this before please fix this as soon as possible"
"I kept hearing that it's pay to win. It's not, characters/servants basing on what stars is bad. Because it sets the mindset of new players to get a 5‚òÜ and soon curses the game since they didn't get their waifus or husbando. Always remember that farming materials and EXP cards can make a 1‚òÜ-3‚òÜ as OP as 5‚òÜs out there. Never go with the flow, create your own team out of the norms. That's what makes this game fun. Happy 5th anniversary FGO! More annis to come!"
Why do I have to pay for qurts to summon when I already earnd a lot of em that's just stupid
Game crashes every time I enter battle.
Can't play since latest update. Crashes every battle.
It's not fun in my eyes the only reason I installed it is so my brother can leave me alone so if he sees this I don't like mobile games
The game is good but there is a lot of Logging and sometime it close by it self But the game it self is good
Ive been having loading issues since MARCH OF THIS YEAR unable to load into the game besides 20 seconds and it crashes. Optimize the game for android 21ultra and then i'll come back! This is bs since I've been playing since day 1.
"The game is fun but everytime I go into battle it crashes, please fix this problem."
Predatory gacha.
So good üòò i really love it.
"Excellent story with engaging events and good gameplay. A must for fate fans. Only downside is that unlike other games where all of the data is backed up by the email, it is binded to a device so if the user faces mishap that makes them lose the account and if they dont have the transfer code, they lose all their Servants"
"600 quartz and i still coudnt get castoria, i love the game very much but still this ain't right"
It's so good I'm now living under the bridge.
Always had a lagging issues. It stops during the gameplay etc.
Joyful
I LOVE MASH üíú
Not working alway in restart or retry try to download it 5x still nothing
"Stay away! Do not ever play this game. Do not ever throw your hard earned money at this game! It's not worth it! They just want to take your money. They have an admittedly excellent story, but it's hidden behind an archaic combat system, excessive grinding, and that god forsaken gacha. You can spend every free currency to roll for servants for half a year and get nothing but complete four star garbage. Don't listen to anyone who tells you four stars are good! They aren't!"
Worst anniversary ever now I know rate up is lie
"I absolutely love this game. While I bounce between various mobile games and constantly install early access games, I always leave space on my phone for this one. It's always preformed really well and I've had very little issue with it, only crashing a handful of times over several years. An issue I do have it that the game freezes and stutters after playing for a few hours or when my phone auto suspends. Sometimes for a rather lengthy time. Closing and reopening usually fixes it though."
"Best game ever, not like any other gacha game. This game is very good and every card is good I'd the equipment is right. Though you may experience multiple kickoffs because you don't have a good device or it is the game rejected the device your 0n. Other than that, it is a very good game and I highly recommend it to people who like/love watching the Fate series."
JP is better than NA when it comes to rate ups Facts
"The pull rates aren't good, I Used almost 300 saint quarts and 26 tickets and I still didn't get Castor Artoria :("
Fix. The. Crashes. Literally unplayable for like a month now.
nice game
"Lots of grinding to get free saint quartz, otherwise this is a money-grab game. Other than that, great game, great animations, and quite a good story."
It's so cool 10/10 ü§©
I was having issues with the game but I think the update fixed the glitches and is awesome again
"Game is crashing endlessly during all parts of use. Crashes during summons. Crashes during NPs. Crashes at quest rewards. Crashes when browsing the main menu. Unplayable. After wasting 600+ SQ (again) chasing a single ssr servant on her own banner, and nothing to show for it except 10 of the same event CE, and a handful of mediocre and unwanted sr's, I would legitimately never recommend this game to anyone. Don't spend your money on this game. Don't spend your time on this game."
I loved this game but it glitches when you get too many servents and/or items. I have asked for help a few times but it still causes me problems. I unistalled it and re-installed it but it's still causing me problems. It truely saddens me that I can't play this game no more.
One of the stingiest gacha games I've ever played
Very expensive gatcha game
So able to play without spending money plus story is awsome and I hear the anime is even better
Best app based game I've ever played!
Epic
Love the game it's fun and relaxing
Game just locked me out.
"Love the game and haven't stopped playing. Can you please update the game after this update lol I keep getting kicked every 5 minutes, love the game though, keep it up, always looking forward to the next update."
"Good game, beautiful characters from fate series and great story. But the gacha sucks."
"Great story, lores nice, world building could do with work, gameplay can get stagnant but that's fine for it's style, arts mostly amazing, hate craft essence with a passion but I'll deal. Sometimes characters can be outstanding or just okay there's a range. Great game overall, beware craft essence"
"It's a great game with amazing art, the only thing I feel would make it better is that there should be less grinding when it comes to progession in event stories."
Did you have fun seeing me suffer?
"My first year were tough. From gameplay to gacha. Yea. Especially the gacha. The graphics looks old its like a y8 game. But ever since Lasengle came, the changes are good. The game is being more generous and many players are gettinf what they want and deserve. The story is 10/10, design is 10/10 music and sfx is 10/10 as well. I would rate it 3 or 4 star bc of the sh*tty gacha and old designs but its slowly getting better now. Thank you lasagna. We masters will continue support this game."
my wallet.
Horrible rate. This and other gacha games should be investigated and banned by governments for the abysmal rates they have.
"this is a waste of time game, sure its f2p but that summon rate is terrible, translation is cringy and gameplay wise is boring"
Fun game cool designs and character but main reason I give it 3 stars because it's extremely pay to win like what the heck is a paid saint quartz for a anniversary summon
Welcome to gacha hell 4 stars cause the pull rates are garbage steeped in sewage
"I want to rate 5* ,but i want to ask some question if u reading this i hoping, for changing or repair the transfer data thing?. i think im not the only player talking about this. i/we want to change transfer data in we can freely transfer our data how many times we want. This game is very interesting and satisfying . We're hoping for your feedback about that issue . Please do something about it. Thanks"
Fun to play but glitchy. Closes unexpectedly frequently. Thankfully you pick up basically where you left off but still annoying.
Cool rpg
"Updated: Now have the Pixel 4 and the game works well, still spotty performance on other devices I own. The Android app icon hasn't been updated still."
Been playing on and off since the first year of release. Always keeps me coming back.
I love This game because it's like comic and adventure fightüòé
astolfo
So good
Its a very addicting game
Edited: Game frequently crashes since about early 2022. It's impossible to a simple two without restarting multiple times.
"Bad summon rates aside, FGO/Type-Moon has the best characters of any gacha I've played. Aniplex/Lasengle should make use of them in another, larger-scale game, there's a lot of potential there."
5 years in and still running strong.
Can't play. Crashes to much
This is so good I just finished watching fate stay night I recommend this game if u like the fate series ufotable god
Loved this game as a student. But the long time consuming events do not mesh well with full time work. Had a good run though. Thanks FGO.
"Hello Fate/Grand Order team I love your content I love fate. I also wanted to add a cool little fact about me, do you know of Michael Scott the wizard of Scotland? Well I'm related to him, anyways keep up the good work this game is pretty cool I love the updates. Especially appreciate the hard work during these trying times. <3"
After today update. 6-13-22 Game crash everytime I use Gilgamesh np and random crash on some servant attack animation. edit : I manage to fix the problem by set the phone to force it to use GPU render graphic (mine is Gallaxy S11) that will drain more battery. Still weird cause I can play FGO fine witout setting that before those update.
Love this game huge fan of the series
"Been playing since release, and while many complain about the gacha rates, they're really not bad considering 5 stars aren't necessary to beat any content. Skills and NP effects are more important. Sure, some 5 stars are game breaking, but only if you have the right roster to make the setup. The only thing I had to complain about was fixed with the 5th anniversary. The game is still a bit grindy, but unless you spend huge to get all the SSR's it shouldn't be too hard to grind what you need."
One thing i hate about this game is how on release they region locked it.
"So umm. The game is great and all because of the ""old"" yet nostalgic type of interface. The gameplay is simple, and the story is fantastic. All you just need in this game is patience and time grinding for saint quartz. (Also, the droprates are hella low). But anyways, i love this game."
The best and the worst game at the same time.
Beautiful and emotional story very educational too with a colourful cast of characters & Voice actors everything is good except the drop rate is a lie compared to the nice game fgo
"If you can see this, your desired gacha roll will surely be summoned."
"I have been playing for over a year now and runs pretty smooth, BUT this past few days it always take so long to load EVEN though my wifi is very fast and my phone is high end. It always says lost connection or something similar to that, no matter how many times i re-install and reset my phone and app, it still says that. And when i uninstall the game and i got my transfer code, when i put it in it says the account is already in use please fix this, this is the only game i play"
"Holy tutorial Batman. I like what's there so far, glad it's not idle."
"Anniversary disappointment, server down"
I like it ü•∞
Fix your servers
Too much RAM and storage usage for this 2D Game
Game is fun
Love the series love this game
Castoria lets go
GIVE OZY AN ANIMATION UPDATE PLSSS
Pag nakuha ko si castoria mag papakasal na ako sa jowa ko ngayon
Happi 5th anniv
It's great game and story but it's very hard to get SR and SSR servant and SQ
I want to recover my account but I still don't get a reply from the support.
Gacha always give me good luck
Been playing every day since day 1
Game kh·ªï d√¢m. T√¥i gh√©t game n√†y
I'm having problem with the connection been playing for a month now but suddenly I lost connection I change this 1 star if the problem is fix hoping for your respond you can already count the days before anniversary. 7/4/21 Now I can't access my account using my transfer number.
Lovely game :)
The graphics is okay
Alright game has its ups and downs like any other
"Good storyline, amazing animations, good looking waifus 5 star deserve"
Its very good i just need better daily rewards
Well haha sorry for complaining but the costs of saint quartz is a little too much.
This game is awesome
I rewlly got addicted to this game but my game file got deleted automatically
"Grind heavy, but the thing is, the progression is way too slow. Rates are bad honestly. Too much pandering to straight male weebs. Greedy devs and expensive items. No QoL in any update so far. Some servant designs are atrocious, objectifies female characters too much. Typical gacha game. Don't waste your time. Want a grindy game, then play GBF."
I don't know what was changed in the latest update but this game is now almost unplayable on my S22 . *Edit* For anyone having issue on Android try installing Android Webview Canary and set it as the default Webview. Worked for me
Everything is good except the blue corners
Worst game ever the summons suck it is the terrible summons more less to get a 4 star or 5star
I play this game without watching the whole anime so Im watching now for better experience this game is good highly recommend for a guy who wanted a adventure game 5/5
Gacha
DeLemaDa
The game rarely crashes for me now
yeah great story but the freaking game is p2w
Hahaha. Can't play or spend when the damn game keeps crashing. Won't have a updated build until August. Very funny. Not.
"Is this game some kind of sick joke? Worst drop rates I ever seen, event don't last long enough to be enjoyed unless you play for hours a day this game need redone properly"
I I fact #wit the q of and
A Very Good GAME ever I've seen
Four star for this game because i thinkü§îü§îü§î its maybe a good gameüéÆ
Really good so far but it freezes for 2 seconds every other minute Wich is kinda annoying and I am pretty sure it's not a problem on my device since I have 3gb of ram and 10gb of storage left
Love the anime
Game is laggy AF! Doesnt seem to matter what device im using or if im wifi or not. Game could be very good if they'd fix the lag issue. Shouldnt take 2 hours to complete 10 story stages....
"Sorry for the bad review, because of connection problem even having a strong wifi connection the game is stock in a black loading screen. I've waited for about 5 minutes but no changes. Im not uninstalling it but hope when i try to open it again the problem is resolve."
Gay

Was good until recent now the game keeps crashing not even letting me play. Still not working properly I really like playing the game but might have to unistall since I can't play.
Nice game and no boring
The game keeps crashing. What happened to this game it didn't use to crash like this.
the grapics of this game is awsome and its so good and not so lag
Depressing.......
i deserve compensation of 30 saint quarts this is how it started i had 29 then a got 1 more SQ soo i go spend my SQs in the 5th anniversary draw then i loss connection then i closed the app then a opened back up the app fearing the worse boom my SQs are gone
"New update crashes frequently, lots of lost progress because continuing the battle starts me from the beginning. This prevents me from making progress in general as it doesn't save between crashes. Only started with new update, device is S22"
Its a fun game i am f2p its crazy fun but also you have to grind grind and grind but i don't really like how japenese version get more events and charcters but i do have lots of luck but i won't sit here and brag i run out of apples because of how much i grind i used almost all my apples kinda shows you how much fun i think the game is but some items are hard to get for new people becasue they need it for assencion you also have to wait a week to for certian class item and exp but its fun
The last few updates are making this game crash a freaking LOT.
"A great game with a simple but really well made turn-based combat system along with an amazing story that is still being updated and probably won't stop anytime soon.but the main selling point is the massive and interesting cast of characters that keeps getting larger and better as time moves on. But as for actual gameplay it is a well made and constantly balanced to prevent power creep along with making low rarity servants actually extremely powerful, like cu being able to solo most bosses"
"This is getting ridiculous! Never ever had a problem and I've been playing almost since the beginning!! I can't even start playing without the game crashing!! Start a battle game freezes. Try to go back in, game crashes! Uninstall reinstall same issues!!! When are you going to fix this?"
"I love the game, but for some reason it won't let me play- everytime I try to do any battles it crashes ive tried everything to fix it"
"Fun and great game. Story and events are amazing too! Gacha sucks, like $80 for some tofu and a miniscule chance of getting servant and even less of getting one that you want. Been playing regularly for years and after this last update, the game has never been this unstable. Crashes every fight, every skill, can't do anything. Must fix, I've already clear cache and the whole shebang."
This is so boring
"I can't update the game, why?"
I always lose my progress after playing for a while it always deletes it
The game is in 5th anniversary and yet the game is not very welcoming to new players complete trash not worth the download so if your a new player and want to check this out just try others don't bother going here
"Love the game and everything was running smoothly for the most part aside from a frame freeze every once in awhile but the game only needed a second and it would continue like nothing happened. Then today (6/28) the game started crashing out of nowhere and freezing animations after id complete my first turn, that was this morning. Since then the game crashes just trying to load the title screen and no matter how many times I tweak the settings or delete and reinstall the game it keeps crashing."
"This game really needs a better way to recover accounts. A signle ""code"" is easily exploitable and hacked, and my own account on which I've spent plenty (and would have continued to if given the chance) could not be recovered because of this company's outdated and terrible system. In a world of 2FA or even email binding, this complete garbage needs to be changed. But they probably won't do anything since this game will always make money. Also dog rates."
Great game!!
best doujin game ive ever played haha
Constant freezing. Unplayable now
its keep kicking me off when i press start
Thats hell you're walking into
So far so good
"Just installed it cuz I got curious... but it wont load and just say ""Failed to connect to the game server"" no matter how good my connect tion and restarted it already multiple times"
"Sad to say, game bores me.. though it's good but that ""connecting"" takes atleast 15-20sec.. the game actually was just like others alike, this one was just a bit enjoyable because of the chit-chats and stories (good for those who loves it) (there is this ""Skip"" thing but i dont like skipping though.. I download this through Wifi and play while using Data, hope this game doesnt consume much while playing.."
I'll try this in first timeüòÖ
I love this game to bits but lately my game has done nothing but crashing after I use a noble phantasm. Until they've fixed this problem I can only give this game a 1 star. Woohoo my first review lol
Absolutely amazing i love fate games
Summer Musashi 5th anni guaranteed pull.
"The game is fun and I've been playing it for a long time. However, since the last two events (US Server), the game itself has been freezing and crashing a lot. Now, all I'm able to do is basically log in for the daily log in before it freezes and crashes. I haven't actually been able to finish a battle in over a month. Are there any plans to actually fix this?"
50% cut scenes and 50% loading.. i fall sleep on playing this game
"If the game crashes on andriod 12, disable Android system webview in settings > apps. The crashing stopped after that."
Why did it crash during my multiple summon!!!! Now I can't even load the game long enough to see what bs I got from the crashed gotcha.. this sucks and I'm a free to play player. Please fix this üôèüèø üò¢
Game is borderline unplayable constant crashes during battle or can't even get past the title screen need to be fixed asap
Man please fix the game already I can play literally every game on my phone without crashing except this. It really feels like every update you mess something up.
"I've been a player since launch, but this recent update has left my game unplayable. I have to restart the app no less than five times per encounter just to play"
Pretty good. Gacha mechanics are quite harsh but the pity System is on the way. Story wise it's great! The narrative continues and I'm looking forward to future updates.
TRASH
"I don't know what happened lately, but the game seems to be struggling to keep itself open and has started crashing a lot more recently. My phone ran this buttery smooth before but now the app seems unstable. Its a fun game, but until i can atleast play uninterrupted for more then five minutes without any sign of crashing, i find my will to play to be all but spent. Plz fix"
Woow gg
The game keeps crashed for me.
rates are very high!!!
"Game won't open past title screen. After clicking, the screen becomes white and shortly closes the app without any error message."
Boring and not interested
"Randomly logs you out mid battle, randomly freezes then closes the app."
Very fun
Pros: Servants' splash arts are very well detailed most characters get a different portrait after ascension. Story is alright. Events are long. Cons: Expensive 79.99 for only 50 spins at the slot machine. Certain servants only available at certain times of the year. No auto battle after completing previous stages. Drop rate for 4* & 5* servants are very low (used around 200+ premium currency around 65 spins only recieved 3 4* servants 6 4* equips 3 5* equips). No pity system. Battle system slow.
I am not sure if it doesn't work
Saber.
Update taking too long
"I adore this game, the story is good the characters are nice and the events are interesting, BUT the rates in this game HURT ME THE TO THE CORE."
"Simply trash. Trash rate, trash game."
Trash game still 5/5
So menny lowding im not pkay beacos of lowding.
I love this game!
"Stayed until Solomon arc (and endured hellish gatcha ever) solid story but worst rng, 11/10 would install/uninstall again"
I thought this one an adventure gamek
Been playing since year 1.... and now it's unplayable due to constant crashing since the Vegas event update. Please fix this. Update 6/24 Still constantly crashing despite cache clear and reinstall.... this is getting ridiculous. I hope a fix gets implemented before the new summer event.
Constantly crashes I can't do anything
"Spent 1000+ sq but still didn't get the limited character, and a hellish grind for little to no reward‚Äì this game is an absolute waste of effort and time."
Everything was great but it keeps on lagging
I loved it ü§©ü•∞
Goooooood game 10/10
Very looong cut scenes makes it boring. The tutorials are primitive and in a flow chart form. Haven't you heard that experience is the best teacher? Let us click on that button and experience what happens rather than just flashing texts about it. The attempt to get to the story destroyed the experience plus everything is so slow in the animation like the summoning alone takes so looong.
Don't get me wrong I really love the game but what gets annoying is the daily promised servents only to get the same 1-3 servents or craft excesses
Game crashes constantly when using special attacks on Samsung Note 10+ and I can't transfer my data back to my Note 8 to actually play because their data transfer policy apparently forbids it.
A very imperfect game but still truly enjoyable. Gacha rates are low but everything can be beaten by low rarity servants. The story is really amazing and it's what kept me playing for years. How they create these interesting characters and weave them into the events is just so good. And they mix the story up sometimes by introducing events that doesn't take itself too seriously.
Very easy to understand! Best game ever!
This is good im fan of Fate Stay Night anime i watched it all nice
Deep lore RNG challenges Loveable and annoying servants Slap OST Good memes Very grinding
Can't even play it. After going through the country selection the app crashes.
It's so hard obtaining star crystals/shards in order to summon and it's also hard to obtain 5 star heroes
"I love the game. But the one thing that absolutley annoys me about this game is the fact that if im not on for a certain amount of time, it deletes my progress and i cant recover it cause i dont remember my transfer code. So yeah."
worst graphics
I'm just here for astolfo
I would love to play but the game is constantly freezing again! So I can't play! And Gil makes it crash. Why does this keep happening when there's an event.
The game has crashed multiple times. I try to finish my battle and it freezes then crashes. I gave up on the battle and made it to the main screen but crashed again. This must be part of the latest update. Please Fix!
"First Las Vegas, now CCC. The client keeps crashing and I can't even hope to clear this content. Please fix. Will change my rating once it's playable."
Game has been crashing ALOT Its getting annoying
Fun story but there is hardly any effort into making the gameplay more exciting. No pity after so long. QoL changes take forever. For a game so well known and how much money people put in you would think there would be more effort into these things. Game is way past it's prime as even 1.98$ mobile indie game has more exciting gameplay than this. The only saving grace nowadays is the art and story. But who plays games only for graphics right? Even the story quality is going down
"I play this every single day and never really had a problem other than once when if wouldn't start at all. Now the game keeps crashing ever since the last update and doesn't even let me have the screen on for more than 1 minute. I tried reseting, restarting, moving the data and anything else I could think of but nothing works, this things needs a big patch before it's playable again. (Update: It's happening again, literally the same problem)"
I would have given it a 4 star maybe 5 star considering my luck. But I am gradually losing interest as my game is crashing for no reason. It started crashing when I reached the Septem Singularity. The more I got into the chapter the more I started crashing to the point it crashes a few seconds after logging in. Idk if I am supposed to clear stuff out or clear caches or whatever and I did everything I could but no change at all.
I accidentally uninstall my fgo and my acc back to start is there way to get it back?
"Lost all my data when my phone crashed, had put money into the game and the team will not help you recover your data, there's no account linking or at least wasn't unlike any other game on the play store. Game play is tedious and the only enjoyable part was collecting servants which is pointless as you'll lose them all if for any reason you lose your phone or need to reformat unexpectedly."
Game crashes constantly after last update. Unplayable at present.
The game is crashing constantly it is virtually unplayable please fix this 5 year anniversary is 2 weeks away.
Pog history
Had to lower my score since I can't even get on now.
New update crashes every turn its basically unplayable. I do a turn and there is a 50% chance it will load to the next turn before crashing/freezing and forcing me to restart the app. I've been playing for several years and this is the worse state of the app so far. Hasn't been fixed for over a month now
"At first this app was a five for me and i loved it deeply but after putting like a big chunk of my time into it and building up a good roster of servants just to lose it all after uninstalling it due to storage issues on my phone yeah not fun, not to to mention this game had way too many updates and the recovery process for trying to get my old profile back is legit garbage i just don't have as much love for this app as i used to."
I grate
Poosie tayt poosie clen poosie fres
After latest update nothing but crashes
I like the story and the events
"Game was good but can no longer play uninterrupted on my ssg s10 for over 3 weeks now. Loading a battle? Crash. Using attacks? Crash. Loading back to world map after you opened the game back 6x to finish the battle? Crash. Usually crashes happen here and there but last patch really messed the game up. E: Actually can't even get past the title screen most tries now. What a shame, I've been playing this game for over 2 years. E2: Still no fix with today's update on 6/21."
"Spent 600 bucks and I got Tesla, Chinese masked guy and saint Martha. Not enough 5 star servants in the rolls!!!!!!!! Gatcha got me."
The best game app I ever played. But I hope they can improve gacha system and provide pity system for salties like me. Love lots FGO ü•∞
Keeps crashing down every so often now
Nasu is fun
Ishtar feet
"I love the Fate Series as a whole. Gameplay is pretty good, Story/Lore gets deeper the more you play, the grinding for events get really frustrating sometimes + easy burn out. But it's totally worth if I get my stupid lil jpeg of my favorite characters. üò©‚ô•Ô∏è"
Crashes sometimes
Lave this game
I loved it in Japanese now I'll play it in English.
Now that there's 2 Astolfo and pity system is incoming I'm chilling like a villain
Just downloaded the game yesterday and it crashes in every battle. Not worth my time to keep restarting.
Any fan of the Fate franchise will definitely enjoy this.
after today's patch i cant update my fgo app. been trying to update it for the last 3 hrs and its stuck with pending.
I can't even summon without the game crashing. Everything I start a mission it crashes. If I finish it then it crashes. I can't even play for more than 5 minutes. Using a Samsung s10+ that I can play anything else on. Very sad. (Edit New update and tweaking with settings has allowed me to play the game properly. Has been very enjoyable the story and content have been pleasing and I look forward to finishing story.)
No tutorial for connecting it on media platform it's great tho can someone help me?
"Loved it so much, Mechanism of this stragegy game"
"I was really close to pay for quartz today and I dont wanna go to that path, My one problem of this game is that theres way too many gameplay and fights with it that I cant progress fast enough to catch up to the story, my decision to play this in the first place was because of the amazing story and characters but I just dont have enough time to progress cuz of thr long gameplays but overall I still give this a 5 star and I will miss this game so much and its already giving me nostalgia"
"It's like Dark Souls, but with more waifus."
"I love it, the best game ever!!!"
I went to update the game and was surprised to see a number of negative reviews. I've never had an issue with crashing and such. I also tend to play on phones that aren't older than five years so that might be why. At one point I put this game down and lost my account and the support team was able to recover it very quickly. This game highly encourages in game purchases but there is a huge community of f2p players that love it all the same. There isn't a mobile game I love more than this.
Crash bug has been fixed.
It üòä fun
"Hey, Fate keeps on crashing on me, making it hard to play. Can you do something?"
Castoria let's goooooo
"Ignoring the rng (which is abysmal) the gameplay is quite deep particularly if you don't use meta servants. But, the end game only consists of grinding with the only challenge content being from events and new story chapters."
its a very good game and very good quality
Gacha is a form of monetization model that preys on vulnerable people who have no control over their gambling addiction.
I hate how FGO's gatcha system is unforgiving but its stories and characters were top tier compared to other gatcha games.
"This game is amazing, the support team are great!"
This eat all my luck :( where mordred swimsuit.
"Needs PvP, repetitive NPC battles can only go for so long"
"The epitome of a gacha game. You'll most likely play this game not for the gameplay itself, but for the characters and the amassing of resources. It feels good to get rare servants and build them up, and the actual rpg combat is simplistic yet still enjoyable. If you play these types of games, give this one a try, but if you don't know what gacha games are, or even anime for that matter, then I don't think you'll find much to enjoy."
please add new servants hahaha
Best Gacha game ever!!!!
Type moon game!
The game has some of the best story telling I have seen! The gameplay is simple yet can become complex as one progresses through it and the characters are each well written! Recently the game has become really laggy and would stop for minutes at the time. It does take the fun of the game
Not half bad
"Pretty good, I must say."
salty Gachas
"Phenomenal story, relatively fun gameplay, great collection sim and super convenient in terms of time sink. The only downside if any is honestly those rate up drop rates but even then it's not as bad as most other gachas where your character will become useless later on."
Not bad but there are better fairer games also slow update and translation times with poor rewards and communications from the developers. Play for the story and the events are pretty fun but the game can be a total grind and tedious to play at times really outdated game system as well (edit) they added a back button a small step in the right direction still a 3 star game tho. Major issues with account transfers as well cant transfer back to old devices.
I am now broke 10/10
After 4 year of play bout to hit five when the anniversary come is going to be great plus can't wait to hopeo get Castoira but gg got a new phone to Im ready and hype about this to üòéüñï
"recently the game keep crashing and freezing I already tried everything clearing cache, restarting my phone even reinstall the game and it kinda fix it for a bit but then the crashing and freezing come back and it get worse than it was previously too. hope the problem can be fix soon !"
Good game dis game is so cool gays danlowd dis game
Used to be good but now the glitches are making it unbearable to play the game.
See other reviews if you have problems with crashing. It should be a simple fix.
Fun game but the recent updates have rendered it unplayable. Can't get past the login screen anymore
GIVE NOBUUUUUUU
It's a good game I just hope that english server is also generous to their new players like the jp version. I want to play jp version since they are generous to their players but I also want to understand the story.
"This is as good as gacha games get - that's the justification for my rating. Sure, there are no auto functions as in other games, but that means you will learn how to actually play. Additionally, I have learned that auto functions always mean that there is more grinding to do than is physically possible. The time taken grinding in this game is actually slightly less. The story is alright, definitely could use some better writers (as could this review). It drags."
This is really good
I got mama Raiko
Constant crashes made it unplayable for me.
Its good tho and the graphics are cool
"CONSTANT CRASHES, they are getting out of hand. These crashes are making the game entirely unplayable. My game crashes every single turn on a quest and it's just purely annoying. Hoping it gets fixed and we get some kinda compensation for literally not being able to play!"
It is great game ever
Trashy gatcha system. Gathering saint quartz is really hard so using it to summon both essecnce and servants was a HUGE turn off for me. Ive spent huge amt of money in games but NOT in games like this one with a combine summon
just lack costumer service and doesn't buff immediately if needed.
Fails to download everything and just white screens after you get to the Excalibur special attack in the tutorial. After 3 attempts with the same result thats it for me.
Ok good and nice
its good and all but I hate the camera following and bruuuhjjjj its so stiff. I think this is the worst way to emplement 3d and its also scuff af.
Overall i love this game that's all
"Have been having fun with the game, but after the previous update the game has been crashing alot. You can barely play it at all."
"Loved the game, but recently its been unplayable, crashed when the app loads up"
"I loved it mechanism is simple, easy to understand."
I have no time grinding with me stuck in the screen all the time. Activate autobattle for Long grinds.
I stall this game but so very slow üòî.
The game keeps crashing at random increasing interval and it's now unplayable
"Great mechanics, strategy and amazing story, but is overshadowed by how anti-'Free-to-play' it is. Most of the great story is locked behind an RNG resource grind and a combination of high prices for heroic spirits and a slow earn rate. I've played multiple mobile games like AFK Arena and Azur Lane and this one is by far the worst for F2P players. TL;DR, Good game ruined by greed."
A day 1 player and I've never had problems untill now. Since Summer rerun it constantly crashes. I have a Galaxy S20 plus
definately a good game if you are invested in the lore and characters! but the gatcha is horrible unless youre a whale
"I love the fate series, but this game it's just so out of date."
Pls Game Owner Give Me Data I Need It Pls. üôè
*‚ï≠Ô∏é( Àô¬∫Àô)‚ïØÔ∏é*
"Game is crashing constantly. I'm spending more time waiting for the game to start than actually playing, and that's assuming the game works long enough for a turn to go by."
This game is amazing but van you pls add a bit more time for the events
One of my favorite stories ever! The story from singularity 1-5 is good but it becomes exceptional at Camelot highly recommend playing.
The loading was so annoying It takes a lot of time than playing
I love this game so much!
"Gameplay is smooth,fast to start up or launch,easy to play and there's a lot of amazing servant, their art was superb. I hope you give a 5 star servant...For my experience the drop rate for 5 star is low"
"Great if you can summon cool servants , this round.... nothing. Always try again lol I love my tablet accts awesome servants üòÅ"
"The story is overwhelming, and the design and art is amazing. The only thing I hate about the game is the bad gacha and repitative gameplay. Overall it is a great game."
This game has ZERO respect for your time. It's nicknamed Fate *grind* order for a reason. Finishing an event in a mobile game shouldn't feel like a part time job.
"I have no words to describe this game in a more perfect way. Is it good? You bet all the money in your pocket it's good. One of the best RPG game I have played ever period. It's got it all, story, action, anime, girls, gacha to waste your hard earned money on. Anyway take my word for it, this game is worth it."
There many character and graphic is good
"Gameplay is fine, story is very good, can only really complain about only being able to play on a single device."
"Personally, I love this game. As a huge fan of the fate series, this game has only increased my love for it. On the other hand, since my first playthrough, I've experienced problems with loading and crashing constantly. It makes me want to Uninstall the game, but I don't want to lose my data. The developers should design a way to save and load progress besides the transfer code"
BEST GACHA GAME EVER!
"I've been playing this game since it's original release on NA with breaks now and then but always been consistent. However lately the updates the game has made are on and off with crashes and sustainability. During the QP printing event, this is completely unacceptable as a longtime player and takes away from my chance to set myself up and farm for a longtime coming. Devs get it together and focus more on your android users."
"Please fix the tutorial, cant get through it without game crashing."
exciting
"I love the gameplay, although it's pretty buggy.. the auto button doesn't work, I somehow got stuck on the white screen for Excalibur I had to restart the game, if u leave the game on for a few seconds ur phone will just turn off automatically to the point it's annoying now the interaction feels a little bland.. but the gameplay's system is awesome I like it's uniqueness and potential, please fix these bugs"
"I have been playing for a while and other than a hiccup where I lost my account a few years back, the game has been reliably entertaining. The characters are fun, the main story is suitably dramatic and the event stories are suitably comedic. The only thing stopping me from marking this game higher is a lack of an auto battle system for farming quests. Grinding through those quests is a grind, and a auto quest system would be benificial."
Game won't stop crashing since update back at the end of May and I'm on a galaxy s22.
Jesus christ someone save me from Gacha...
D fun!
Cute game.
Its good but lack of tutorial. The tutorial is too short.
Edit 3: s10e Now it's just crashing for no reason. Edit 4: Working now but kinda clunky sometimes. Idk man
"The code account system is horrible. I lost my account due to getting a new phone, and can't recover it now. I figured, sure, it's a fun game, I can deal with it, but I'm level 65 now and still can't get a single 5* compared to the 15 I had on my other account. I'm considering restarting to try again, but my God the story is so unbelievably boring I really can't bring myself to do it"
"Love the game, but it's completely unstable and buggy. I just got back into it and I'm really sad that I can't now. It's really frustrating and I'm searching for anything really"
"This Las Vegas rerun event has made this unplayable. I can't get through a single wave or two without the game crashing, even the menu a couple of times. It doesn't help that certain animations seem to constantly crash the game for me. Pretty disappointing I'm not gonna be able to finish the event if this doesn't get fixed within the next couple days before the event ends."
"Been playing for a couple of years, but the latest android update has the game unplayable. Love the game and hope to hang on to login streak until they fix it."
Wasted 20 mins. on tutorial. Why no skip button on tutorial?
GACHA
Crashing way to often
"Hey guys, the crashing and freezing sucks but this seems to work: Apps, android webview, disable it and restart phone. It worked. Thanks to Dalton Stallworth. Just forwarding his message. Hope it works for you all too."
Your game too laggy for a side scroller game! Improve your server!
"Players! If you're having crashing issues on Android, try going to Apps>Android Webview - disable it, then restart your phone. It should re-enable itself when your phone starts up again. Cleared up my crashing issues immediately. Hope this helps someone, and thanks to Jason Tan for suggesting it originally!"
"I'm currently having a bug with one servant's Noble Phantasm. Tamamo no Mae (Caster) Blessing of Amaterasu. After a few uses, I glitch out. The animation of the NP freezes, I get the error of app stop working, or NP freezes and I get kicked from app. These both have me redo the part I was at in game, which thankful for, but never the less very annoying. Please inspect character animation üôè"
"Been playing since year one. After the last update, Ive been crashing very often."
Takes too much time to start. For an idle game it is not good to take much of resources before you could started it. I strongly suggest making it possible to be playable as soon as you installed it and for the players yo be allowed to pause the download while playing.
Good.
"Great way to get into Fate. Lower rarities are very viable and free to play is 100% doable. Lots of lore and story, great takes on characters from history and mythology. Not sure what else needs said, haven't been away from it since starting because I enjoy it."
It's alright
No giv mp5 emiya
"Game is a pile of treasure trove of content and stories to tell. I love Fate lore and how deep and connected their stories can get; it keeps getting better and better every chapter as the story progresses. Characters have their own individual stories and as you dwell more to their motivations and actions, you will learn to love each and everyone of them. Story makes you experience different kinds of emotions; you may feel happiness and laugh sometimes or feel the seriousness of the story and cry"
"Great game, but the only problem for me is that it's quite laggy and it freezes sometimes"
Please fix! I'm getting tired of the constant crashing! I've been playing since day 1 when the game first came out and haven't had any issues until the past week when the last update was made. I want to continue playing so please fix it because the constant crashing is very annoying!
Moar wifus
"Uhhh, it's a pretty fun game and a somewhat addictive game. The story is something that'll really draw you in if you're a fan of Fate, new to Fate, a fan of magic related anime and much more. However, this game will cause you pain, far more pain than you've ever experienced before in the Gacha.. Another thing, multiple glitches spotted here and there."
Shmuckus this game is shmuckus
"Really love playing this game so much started playing in 2019 haven't stopped yet love the servants,gameplay,story,and the events."
"One of the most predotary game out in the market, granted the writing team(Nasu and his staff) does an excellent job in creating narratives that people can enjoy whilst the drop rate in this game is god awfull, on top of it it's been many years since it came out and yet it has no pity whatsoever, don't let the free to play tag fool you."
"Hello I enjoy the game quite greatly, but i am currently facing an issue. The app constantly exits after a few seconds when the logo appears everytime i want to play. I cant seem to fix it. Its rather ptoblematic."
"The god father of gacha games and the peak of the mountain. It has the best story, the best agonizing gacha gambling experience, the best characters, the best boss fights, the best character leveling, and ok combat. This is more of a light novel that you will spend 8 hours reading each day when new content drops, than an actual game. But, because of the writing and well designed characters the boss battles are amazing and are a fun challenging puzzle to overcome. A game everyone should play."
"Can you remove/delete the data, please so I can gave you a 3-5 star ü•∫"
"I have been playing the game since the beginning. It has been smooth. But lately, the game keep on crashing to the point that it is unplayable. Hopefully the developer can fix this issue"
Boring as hell
Game shuts down in middle of missions. Cleared cache and re-download several times.
Some fun to be had. Especially if you equate spending money to having fun. The gatcha system is deplorable whereas compared to other games you need 10 of the specialized items you need 30 in this one. Each character has about a 100 items to upgrade in different systems it's just ridiculous. There is just really a little too much to upgrade to really have any fun in this. Seriously streamline the system for upgrading characters in their items. It wouldn't take away from the game.
"Story is great, gameplay is surprisingly fun. Abit of lag on my old device but on my new one it is much smoother. Honestly a great app for anyone who liked Fate."
Easy Five Star. Cuz Seiba. With her EKUSUKARIBAAAAA!!!
I can't even play it now. It refuses to load
Game refuses to take my transfer code so I lost everything. Stop using transfer codes.
Its really good
"Update 4/6/22: Android issue w/ webview. If you are seeing this and have Crashing issues, disable and re-enable android webview then restart your device. Fixed crashing issues. Update 4/6/22: constant crashes when attempting to resume an event quest. After 45 minutes, was forced to abort. Update to review 3/6/22 Crashing issues persistent for multiple days. Been playing for multiple years. No announcement or investigation of issues"
Its geting better. Pity system needs work and still need a way to get event characters that were missed.
I Cannot get through one battle or even a free summon without it crashing.
Would be five stars if it didn't crash constantly Almost every time I do anything
Keeps crashing constantly
"After the latest patch, more specific the Vegas summer re-run event the game crashes constantly and there was a patch but still happens constantly even when pulling for servants which is the bread and butter of this game, the devs either don't care or they can't fix the problem w.e it is if this keeps on happening might as well just quit all together it was fun while it lasted"
"After the last updated crash event in loading, from 5 star to 2 or less in one updated."
This game is so boring nothing especial
Had to lower my review due to recent updates causing the game to freeze or crash much more often than before. Otherwise still enjoyable to play
Continuous crashing on galaxy s22
Gotta improve on speeds and ratings
I'm here because of the Chinese drama falling into your smile üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I love it!!
They are deleting negative reviews so I am reposting this. The app is buggy and unoptimized. Events are poorly explained and convoluted. I also never received my free SSR ticket for the recent campaign so that's that. The only reason this game is as popular as it is is because of Fate IP. Without it it's just a mediocre game with boring mechanics and lazy writing.
I'm new to this game and have been enjoying it so far but ever since the new update it's been crashing constantly fix ya damn game
"I have recently been getting a lot of lag spike, and its getting really annoying. and sometimes when I want to log in it just won't let me in, I also lost my log in streak because of this. Pls fix üôè"
Sobrang ganda kasi nitong laro na to motorola removing download muna makakalaro mo rin ang iyong mga friends
Pain pain pain
I seem to be having an issue where the game will crash during certain attacks which have a high amount of particles and effects. I only started playing again since the seven sword beauties event started. I have a samsung s10 on android version 12
Crashes constantly when using NPs or even just attacks. This is straight unacceptable for a gacha game.
"Summon rates sucks, no consideration for newcomers."
Throw your money in a fire. It will be a better use for it than playing the gacha in this game.
Great Game I like the updates so I give it 5 star
Can't claim 17 million download ticket despite meeting the requirements.
"This game however is focused more on servants & gameplay than the story. The main story was too long to follow, but however the character designs are from alright to pretty good. The downside to whoever plays this and Type-Moon fans is that THE GACHA RATES SUCK, INCLUDING THE LTD BANNERS. This game is like somebody's ex-girlfriend, but bit worse! Play the game and see what I mean. 1 year later update: it lags like heck some often, so please fix this."
So the game itself can be fun amthr story is amazing. The biggest problem I have is the support and the mans system. Having a support as your mandatory 3rd servant gets rid of the fun and strategy of the turn making game for beginners. People who don't want to have another's servant can use their own servant they have that actually fits the team. Basically don't make support mandatory make it a reinforcement unit to come out when a servant passes away.
Fun game but sometimes I wish it had an auto system sincr you have to repeat easy stages over and over again. Good for waifu/husbando lovers. I choose Gilgamesh. ü•∞
Very good game if Merlin comes home ffs
Fate Grand Order is always high on the top grossing games list and its clear why. This game has the most captivating and immersive story I've ever found in a mobile game. Regular events that reward the player with an incredible amount of upgrade materials for your units. Great gameplay involving tons of strategy and team planning. Yes the gacha system has abysmal rates but this is a single player story focused game entirely beatable with 2 and 3 stars and wellfares!
It is so disappointing and why it isn't opening
Great game has good fun and interesting content
"When we delve into the deepest abyss that is entertainment, we find ourselves surrounded by myriad options for games. Not many options is a good options, however when you think about just how many bad ones there are out there you come to forget that good ones still exist In other words, game gud."
I thought i would have a nice experience but right at the start i got stuck at the black screen with the jumping rabbit and I believe that my internet is fast. What am I supposed to do?
"Great game.. Entertaining and fun.. Great plot,cute servant's but rate-ups are a lie.. Overall, a great game.."
"So boring and so very, very slow. Even the title screens take several seconds longer than they have to. Summoning is also a slow, grueling process of watching unnecessary animations."
"Game keeps crashing after the recent update, this needs to be fixed"
I rated this 4 star because I got lucky hahaha thanks devs
This is good its a nice game
"Theres really nothing to complain about except the Gacha rates, but unlike other Gacha games that shows that the higher the rarity a unit has the better the unit is, this game differs because Rarity in this game doesnt determine how good the units is and everything can be completed with Low Rarity units(you just need to put in the time and effort to raise them) which competes with even higher rarity units, and they also sometimes give out Free SSR/SR tickets to players in some campaigns"
"what the hell? this game lags when a minute hasn't even passed, I thought its my phone that has a problem but no, it only lags whenever I play this game, it always lags whenever I play it even when it's still loading, it's a fun game and I will rate it 5 star if the lag stopped, the lag really stops me from enjoying it, m"
Stressed out
Keeps crashing on Samsung S22 ultra. Please fix this.
Amazing game but I sadly had to change my first review because the game has been crashing a lot for me on my samasung I don't know what the issue is but I've seen a lot of people reporting such a thing and yet the developers don't seem to be working on it.
Mordred
"I used to enjoy this game, I would play it non stop, but I've grown bored of it recently the game lags between fights and loading screens the storyline isn't cohesive, I've given up after Camelot. To me, this game isn't worth playing or spending money on for it's gatcha aspect even with normal characters you die constantly and it's so beyond frustrating."
Game keeps crashing.
You can't connect your Google account to keep your characters. My phone went a reset so now I need to start from square one as opposed to just installing and selecting my account. Please do something for this cause I couldn't write down the transfer code before the reset.
Super astig talaga ng raro na to grabe ameyziy
Please fix the bugs it not letting me play the game
Fun story and characters. Brutal rolls.
This is a good game but you need to improve your gacha rate
It's an amazing app but sometimes it's boring hehehehe
"W game and w anniversary, doodoo gacha rates tho, at least add a pity system like u did with fgo jp frfr"
"I didn't even get to play the game. It just loads than crashes, Im not sure what the issue is but please fix this."
Amazing game but rates aren't the greatest and basically no pity system other than that everything is awesome
Still good.
So Much FUN!!
Got my account back :)
"With Atlantis I saw that you like to add difficulty to everything, so here's my little contribution to that, I know only one with 1 star its not that relevant, but it's everything I can do to contribute to add difficulty"
Gender bent historical figures are my type now
The game got me hooked and i can't get enough of it everything here is amazing from the storyline to the characters and the art 10/10
Oh my gosh this is my top5 fav game
"Think of a reason to not play: pity less, outdated, whale alignment, not for those who dislike repetition. Think of a reason to play: Waifu, Saber, Lore, Eye watering art, craft essence üëå, lots of contents, not that grindy, Fate, Tohsaka, Voice acting are marvelous, Mash, Numbers, Collection, gacha addiction, Addiction to salt, etc."
The game was good until it days that it needs to be updated but i cant find the update button üò≠ pls fix this i have so much progress in this app
I don't have to say much as i am new to the game but i am impressed by the graphics and characters and the story though i didn't watch much of the anime but it really is good just a bit grindy than other games but it is good overall i just wish that they implement a pity system somehow for the gacha as i heard that this game has no pity system for gacha but overall this game is good.
Best game to pass time and can make the best doujins
"I hate Jalter, but I hate Morgan way more."
"Extremely cool game to invest time in. A MUST give 5star, best must give more suuport"
It has great story and animation
"FGO while it does have plenty of pitfalls that everyone complains about has this level of charm that causes you to overlook the flaws and focus more on the fun aspects. And the best example of this is the story, while slow at the start is one of the biggest reasons I still play the game. I'd also like to say that the game is slowly becoming more and more newbie friendly without sacrificing the effort made by long time players."
"This game is scintillating in its story, its simple gameplay mechanics, especially the waifus and etc. I would highly recommend it to others. However, do take notice that those who have compulsive spending habits should steer clear of this game as it may more or less ruin you financially."
yeah
V OOD' 2022 STILL VOOD
If you are a new player dont download. Not new player friendly. After all this time still no quality of life.
Fate good
No google account log in?
Spend so much on a stupid banner and didn't pull a single 5 star rates are so low
Love this game and the characters but my only problem is whenever there's an event the lag and constant crashes is just frustrating clearing cache doesn't help.
It's pretty neat
"I would give 5 stars, but ever since the latest update, the game crashes pretty consistently during battle or after a cutscene ends. I'm using a Samsung S22+."
Decent gotcha but you'll probably never get your waifu or husbando
the best
do not recommend game cutscenes are boring ... takes 2 to 4 minutes to load to the next sequences
"I love this game. It has good graphics, events, and heros. But however the most annoying thing is that when im playing or I click on something, it randomly freezes or kicks me out. Please fix this, it's getting really annoying."
"The story and the events will keep you busy and it makes the game more exciting. It's just that there are times wherein it will take awhile to load and, the longer you play the game the more you will encounter pause loading even during battle. And the part wherein you can only use the code once in changing device is a problem if you encounter an incident wherein you dont have the access to the said code it sucks to start from scratch. Please try to make it email based. Thanks"
Can't update game since new update please fix
"This game is somewhat fun, with a pretty good story, but the grind for any sort of summon is quite ridiculous."
"Started playing since I thought the story of Fate was interesting and had good characters and noticed a free 5* character campaign was going on too. I fulfilled the requirements to obtain the ticket to obtain the free temporary unit, but it was never sent to me and the mission tab to recieve the ticket didn't even appear. Blatant dishonesty and false advertising, I'm glad I never spent a penny on this."
I've been playing this game since launch. And have never had a single issue. But due to a recent patch my game now suddenly hangs when I'm servants cast their Noble Phantasms or just normal play. I've put a lot of time (And Money) into this game because I absolutely love it. But I'd really like to see this issue fixed soon. It's making it hard to play effectively
"10/28 A nice Complex game that I couldn't play as I didn't have time, but the tutorial is a bit long. 5/23. FGO seems simple till later on in the game. Only thing I wanna add is now I can say the Story definitely gets good but if you like games with auto feature you are going to hate this game üò≠. It's definitely got fights that are hard and, more importantly, different but DAMN you better get a triple NP/loop team ASAP. GL on Castoria you traitors of skadi. Voyager best looper no contest üò§‚ù§Ô∏èüò§"
"Need to work on updates not taking so much space and more content, masters should be able to get involved more and be able to change master skills to suit us."
"Love the game, game crashes after update and force closes. Also it's also crashing during Sei Shongan Arts attacks on 3rd ascension. And Seigfried's NP"
"Gameplay could be more clear, several mechanics arent explained in depth enough to make good decisions without the trial and error that the random nature of progression prohibits."
"The game itself is fun, the story is great and game is quite a challenge sometimes as well, although the gacha luck/rates isnt very good tho, so dont expect to get you waifu everytime! Goodluck peeps EDIT (09-25-2021): Currently speedrunning LB1 and LB2 hehehe, I want to participate in the Oniland event! Goodluck everyone! (03112022) Still alive and playing, waiting for new events and waifus to come home! New update is good too! (05242022) Im still speedrunning LB2, I need to do better!"
It's a great gameüî•üî•
"I play this game every other month or so. Some times I pay attention to events, but I really just farm items and pull for Servants most of the time. I really like seeing characters that I've seen in the anime adaptations."
Good game but you need a lot of luck
"YOROKOBE SHOUNEN/SHOJO!!! Welcome to your fate!!! Rates are a lie. Good luck you need it. Just come and be sad with us when we try to get the waifus/husbands. Also join us in malding when FGO arcade get the cool stuff. Story is cool. If you like fate, you'll like this. I never played a vn so I'm guessing this is the closest I'll ever get to reading the fate vn. Enjoy and remember, gacha is bad civ!!"
"This is an amazing game with awesome characters , however do keep in mind that you will have to grind for a lot of things in this game."
"Wondering when you're going to bring in the English dub actors, I mean Netflix is running the Anime so couldn't you ask the actors and actresses to reprise their rolls for in-game dialogue, the Japanese actors and actresses are great but would like some variety."
"The grind is real. But for me as a f2p player its hard to start up with just a 1 free decent servant. Atleast give a free Supprt focus servant for new players. But even so i been playing since launch. Now i got a decent team. üòÅ and just got summer BB on my 2nd 10 roll. Nver spent real money in game. Everything about the game including the grind is Fun. And tons of waifus ‚ù§Ô∏è may 24,2022 still playing strong üí™"
Love it and enjoy playing it.
"Love the art, BUT be warned, you will spend lots of resources, Money and it is not guaranteed to get the characters you wanted, unlike other games. As long as you can handle the fact that sometimes no matter how much you spin, you will not get the character, then it's a good game. After the update, game crashes, had to uninstall the game and restart the phone. But still have the same issues. Please fix this bug! Again! FIX THESE BUGS, another update it's even worst now."
the game is very good and entertaining. i love how simple the game interface is. highly recommend. looking forward to more events in the future.
Great and true to the anime
I want merlin :(
the rate up is a lie
"Idunno, the rates are low asfuq and then they don't have pity system. However, i can't quit this game because the story is extremely captivating and every character is just.... Mmmm: perfection. Yeah the gameplay is enjoyable, very much. Reward system sucks, you'll need to keep farming for a year to max out a character, but hey-- anything for those waifu right? lol. Jokes aside I really enjoy this game as much as I hate it, but still I'll be playing cuz I want to unravel more about the story."
"The game's great. The story is well written and the mechanics might seem simple and bland, but it's quite deep. Drop rate is kinda bad tho. Pls add pity system"
My luck
Thanks for this game because it has a good story plot and gameplay and thanks to your c.support for helping me to get back my account. More power to all of you
I really love this game been playing for almost 3 months i love the Waifus i wish I could get Astolfo next time if possible please ü•∫ Edit:Really thankful i got Astolfo thank you! Developers definitely recommend
Recent patch has been causing the app to crash frequently. Need to grind quite a bit to enhance your character and the recharging of energy can take up to half a day.
Love it! This game is very ideal if you like the fate franchise
I like fate
"After making 14 accounts, I'd say it's pretty good."
Great game for the fans. Really captures the essence of the franchise and feels worthwhile. Story is actually quite good and difficulty scale with progression is not insane.
Fun game. I like the story. Clever but simple combat mechanisms. Would be nice to have better and more varied music.
"On the one hand, sometimes the localization is terrible and full of spelling and some of the writing is bad. But when it's good, it's incredible, and well worth enduring the issues. (Blackbeard. Blackbeard is terrible)"
I love this game in every multiverse!!!!!
"Best free to play game on mobile. No need to pay unless you can't get enough, which is quite fair."
Nice game but gacha hell
Freaking salty that I still dont have my waifu Semiramis in the game..... damnit 10/06/2018 Edit: 5/23/2022.. I still dont have her
Rate ups are trash
"This game's story is just so good, first 7 chapters are alright, Chapter 6 and 7 are really good but like not ground breaking kind of good, you get 4 extra chapters, they are fun, some are challenging but they are optional, but then oh boy, Lostbelts, the second part of the game, the story is FIRE, best story I've seen in a mobile game like Jesus the amount of lore there is is fascinating, the characters ecpically the villains are so well written with good motives, and the gameplay is alr ig"
"The plot is really good and enjoyable, I guess"
epux
Still fun even i am a f2p lmao
WTH THIS GAME. 300SQ NO SSR SERVANT LOL XD
Neat
Seggs
I like the game so much.
Pls let me get castoria
"5 years playing this game Story, Plot, Characters, Visuals, Animations, BGM, and FATE it does not dissappoint but of course long time playing there's times getting bored but im still here playing because of all these features especially the story GREAT GAME!!! Highly Recommend it üòçüòçüòç"
"Why did I get only 60 Medea coins?? No matter how I calculate it, that's much less than I should've gotten...."
Addictive
"Amazing game but huge bug with the servant coin update, certain 5star servants did not reward me the coins. RIP Maou Lv120 dream for now"
Septem appears to be one of the stories of all time. The characters were written and the setting is Rome. They did a job making this chapter and it was so. I had an experience with it 1000000000000000/10.6.7
fgo good
Top tier waifus
Ungga bungga i love me some gacha
"Great game, just don't spend money on it."
"I rated ur game 5 stars, now give me 5 star servantsüòµüòºüò´"
Please Make Real Pity System because I have waste item from gacha have too much.
"-1 star just cuz Holmes banner was a complete knockoff of a banner, never rolling for that mf again"
You know I kept it at 1 for awhile over Christmas lottery... now I'm doing it over having to restart the store app to update the game. This is the ONLY game I have thay does this....
Exciting story for Fate fans. More servants character and cool Noble Phantasm. But the rate gacha is suck.
"good, very good"
"The most fairly challenging game on the market with great graphics, sound and gameplay. 5 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
Censorship hitting this games translations
Was really fun to start with. It's possible to get through the game as a f2p but a f2p player will have a worse experience if the gacha is not kind. Buying rolls are too expensive for the returns. Further down the line bosses start having gimmicks that rely on certain compositions. I play as a casual so these are not fun.
"really good game. Love the servants, the graphics and much more about this game"
gud game
"Well, I'm a Fate Series fan so, this game would be a satisfaction to myself especially to further know the existence of Fate. First, well the gacha is like a hell and Quartz are limited only so you need to treasure your Sq. Even though I'm a f2p player, I'm enjoying it, even if its grinding. I hope you release more events, for specifically servants for free but needs hardwork to achieve. I'm Waiting for the free ticket for Allstar servants especially Castoria banner. I need Artoria in my life."
"There's a good reason this gacha is so old by this point. It's got a deep gameplay, and the Gacha rolls may kill you but usually it works well enough. You also get a lot of free gems just by playing. But Arcade has Tiamat, so 2/10 mobile"
"Great game, I've played it since it's NA launch. The story is incomparable whether you're a Fate series fan or not and the community has unparalleled passion for each new development that absolutely is lived up to by the writing. Cons would be the exceptionally outdated grind and terrible rates/practices gacha-side, both aspects seeing slow, minimal improvement over the years. Nonetheless, I'd highly recommend this game to those seeking a truly grand narrative experience."
The Curse Of The Cheating Curators Please Don't Not Download This Curse It Will Hunt You For Life
main reason its four and not five stars is that increasing the bond level of the servants takes to long to make it useful i have jack the ripper from the reasent event and i have done about fifty missions with her in the party and only just today did i get to the second bond level so highly doubt i could get it to five before the event is done so yeah thats my main complaint other then that i love your game
why not stall
Good game but much of loading
"The gacha is the worst, it only give you craft essence than servant"
pity naikin. nanti saya b1
Love this game but recently it crashes way too often that it's almost unplayable.
salt
"Very awesome game, the NP, the voiceline, the character, the stories, ALL MASTERPIECE I've also read the novel, watch the anime series... Everything is ALL GOOD, the game also very interesting.. and knowledgeable.. but I have some problems I think... I've been playing this around 2yrs... Get almost everyone but a friend of mine always consult me if the gacha works... Cuz his been pulling for hundreds to be exact 159pulls I know that's its low I think... But can u buff the percentage. MASTERPIECE"
"Been playing this game for a long time. Game has an amazing story, especially in later parts. Gameplay is good, but if you keep using the same servants you will get bored. Most importantly, you will get disappointed. Rates is one thing, and there's no pity. Just spent about 500 Saint Quartz to not get even a single 5 star servant. If you are playing just for the story then you should definitely play this game. If you are aiming to get specific characters you better be ready to get disappointed."
I love astolfo
Love I'm addicted to it üòàüòàüòàüòÄüòÄüòÄ
No problem whatsoever üòèüëå
nc game
"Got 5 ssr from like 40 pulls so i'm happy, in any case this is a lot better than my main jp acc"
Discriminating - in the US the 4-5 star heroes would appear while in my country we get 4star support cards. Uninstalled
The pinnacle of trash gacha games
I LIKE THIS GAMEE SUPERRRR
I had to refresh like for 15 times to get the desired friend support servant. It's time killing and needs to be fixed.
"Game is great, been playing for years. The problem is that after the last update my game crashes no matter what I try. I cleared the cache, restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled but still crashes."
keeps crashing
Let's be honest here. One of the main reasons why over a million people downloaded this app is because of Astolfo. If you remove Astolfo from this game I would not be surprised in the slightest if all of a sudden the player base is cut in half. He is after all the unofficial bi icon for a reason. The official reddit and discord for Astolfo most of the members who are bisexual is because of Astolfo.He's only sadly available via events but the ad was smart enough to use him.
I have played this game since released and while it's a great game I'm rating this game 1 star because I am disappointed in the support service. After days emailing them and giving them proof they still would not give my account back. I dont know what happened with my email being changed and attached to my account I lost everything that I pulled. I am still upset after 3 to 4 years since I lost my phone. I'm still not happy. Because I did spend money amd show them proof and it's still not enough
Love this game and love the anime series itself. After a couple years I came back to it and eventually obtained Altria Pendragon like I always wanted and fully ascended her. This game is fun and I enjoy the events that still come around. Hopefully hero summon events are more consistent in the future or just more averagely dropped. But definitely one of my favorite games of all time! üòÅ
iojoh
"I like the game and I think it's good,You may have to grind a little but it's okay nice graphics and it runs well on my phone even though it's low end,Pools for the gacha is bad I agree but it gives you the heroes you need for free which is nice since SSR is mostly for luxury you can breeze the game using what you have and not pay for stuff but it's your call"
"Love the game, fun to play, got me a nice servant rooster so far. Got erice and Voyager and a few other 4 stats and mordred as well. The only thing I dislike is the amount of storage it takes up compared to other mobile games, each scene taking up more and more data. Hopefully next game if they ever decide on it works around this problem. I understand why it happens, but it just painful for the phone when issues start to happen. Other then that its manageable."
"I would rate this 3.5 it is good like in arts,design battle mechanics and the story and the sounds too but the biggest downpart is the no auto battle system like ive been playing for a while and still no update about implementing this like it would help me a lot since im busy at certain times so it would really help me manage my time but not its getting tiring like you need to be constantly playing so i hope someday it would get implemented i hope. But for now i think im gonna quit.Great gameüëç"
Hard to get star quarts and gacha rate is low asf only good thing is the story and the unit buffs.
I lost my account how can I get it back
It was a good time but it's very loading on my cp
"2* because story is interesting, gacha system is trash 5* servant low drop rate is to be expected but 4* servant drop rate can feel so criminal it feels like 5* servants drop more."
Its really good game
Game does not respect your limited time on this planet.
"Ever since the update the game keeps crashing. Every time I ho into battle it crashes, when I summon it crashes, when I upgrade it crashes. Please fix it."
I wish I was rich
A wonderful game to play no issues
Love it! Been playing for almost a year now.
This is online üò†üò†üò† please make this offlime
Enkidu
i love this game so much this is like my childhood huhu
Auto in battle when?
"Quite angry with the shady nature of this games developers & customer service...my previous phone had been destroyed & without knowing you needed a ""transfer number"" to recover your data & progress instead of your email or having google play being able to connect to your profile i was told they could not give me access to my account even tho i emailed them my receipts from in-game purchases as proof of my account they told me too bad...basically taking my money and making it so i cant play...üñï"
Taking back the future with my man Hercules has been a blast! This game is great and I would recommend that you play it for a good time.
"This game is a great game to play however the over sexualization of children, some wearing lingerie, some being called the most beautiful things in existance and being sought after but much older men. I could excuse a few things but its nothing short of pedophilic. Abigail williams a child is in a g string. NOT OKAY Edited in 2022 After giving it much thought over and playing for ages this game is a fantastic and wonderful game I would recommend to anyone"
"Fgo before you download. Good story, good gameplay, learning curve around Camelot, rates are pretty bad but that makes you more excited when you finally pull a 5*, don't waste your money; welfare isn't abundant but you shouldn't spend money unless run out of free sq with story and side quests. You can reroll at the start for a free 4* maybe 5* if you're lucky. I suggest doing so. That's basically it, just remember it sometimes takes best boy to be best girl."
Cant update
I like this game cause I'm in love saber and mash muah üòòüòòüòò
To much bad luck but ill give a thumps up cause arjuna godly
All of the story is pretty damn good but the game itself is dated and the gacha is 1% with no guaranteed available in normal banners. you can clear story fine even without 5* servants but if you actually want one because you like them good luck.
"I've enjoyed the game quite a bit in my time playing it. In-game purchases are a bit expensive, but the resources that are purchaseable can be obtained through in-game means simply by playing. The battles do eventually get monotonous and there is no auto battle system, but if you play the game less often and enjoy the story bits between battle this downside is much less apparent. There are LOADS of events that generally last 2 weeks each. The events are frequent & interesting... Character Limit."
Mt favorite mobile game ever.
A good game and story but it keeps crashing when I start anything and I couldn't get to play the last two events
Love This game had to restart lost info to frist profile love the graphics ...It keeps crashing due a bug ... Honestly y'all plz fix this issue this game is amazing I would love to keep it n keep playing ..plz again fix bug
"Good game mechanics, very informative regarding our history and all of the historical figures that have shaped, changed and develop our civilization. I am just concerned about how some servants have lacking damage even against servants that they are effective."
"I got all the servants that I wanted, took me 4 years. 2 more years to go to max all of them and I will finally be free from gacha hell. Nvm, t-rex lady is coming, so is female gawain... Guess I'm staying for awhile, help."
"Think they fixed some bugs, my game doesn't crash anymore...been playing for almost 5 years now, the story is great and that's what keeps me going."
Fun but it's so hard to grind
Gacha. Good civilization
"hey, its been a year daddy. i really really miss you."
Gacha makes the whole world go around and then go into depression when they find it to be a spook. Good game regardless. Just don't get to invested in it and you'll never succumb to the salt
Summon rates are the only problem tbh and not skipping NPs
G o O d.
I love this game a bit grindy and not for everyone but it has some thing for long time fans of the series.
Great story
"Save for muramasa. Castoria is temporary, shiroumasa is eternal."
Just playing because I'm a massive Fate nerd.
"Pretty good and easy to follow. Has characters from the anime to newer ones for a newer taste of the franchise. Would like if 4 and 5 star characters where easier to get, but a good game overall."
It's pretty good though.
Can you please give us the 5 star ember node so we can level up sevents faster please
Now everything is working fine for the past 3 days now is not working again I don't know how long im going to keep doing this again üò¢
"This game is awful, the rates are terrible. I can't stop playing it."
Yeah
"I wish I could play the newest event, but since the update, I haven't been able to login without crashing and reboot several times. It ended making me lose access to my account trying to play game. Support was able to eventually regrant me access. I hope that they fix issue this soon."
Game r√°ch
Give me Morgan pls I have 1k+ sq
"I like the game but I recently got a new phone and once I tried to get back in it just kept saying I needed to clear cache and restart but nothing works and I did read up and saw that I could redownload (what I was thinking) but I don't have my transfer code so I can't get my account back and I don't want to have to restart and have to get all my characters back again because two of them that I really wanted took forever to get, Other than that glitch the game's pretty good."
I LOVE FATE GRAND ORDER! I LOVE FATE! I LOVE SEEING HISTORICAL FIGURES GROW BREASTS OR BECOME WHITEWASHED! THIS IS THE HISTORY LEFTISTS LOVE!
Crashing constantly and 2 years behind content
Ara Ara spending money money we don't have are we?
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏î‡∏µ
"With drops rates insultingly low and a core gameplay loop so uninvested in the players presence, to even call this a game feels like a stretch. I sympathize with the writers who seem to have woven a decent plot around all this, but having it tied to the constant grind for saint quartz for the hope you pull something decent so you can actually progress in the story drags the whole experince down and makes the game feel malicious in nature."
Cant even play the game as it keeps freezing in the tutorials 2nd phase during the 4th hit in the combo attack.
10/10 waifus
"Solid game. The grind is pretty long to get units you actually want, there is a lot to do in game which makes up for it though."
"Nice game, I often get 5 stars or 4 stars servants and it helped me discover more about history, Very well made so i give a 5star."
Man. I lost my account.
"Best game ever .. as anime lover I highly recommend this game. Easy to access and graphics, effects and quality is under rated üíö"
gilgamesh is kinda hot
"Game keeps crashing whether I try to access an event or use a noble phantasm. Uninstalled and reinstalled same issue happens. I'm on an S10+ with the latest update to Android 12, and 12GB of RAM, I shouldn't have this problem."
App won't even open and this is a week after recovering the account from a different phone. Edit: Issue was fixed and am able to continue enjoying my gaming experience.
"Story's 'okay', but not worth spending a single dime on."
"Hey, it's a good game. It just gets frustrating a lot and you need time and patience to get through the story. Overall a fun experience"
Having more than a million words is more of a con than a pro. Just saying.
"Ok it's a good game. However I did drop $160 and pull ZERO 4 or 5 star servants, and yeah I know it's a gotcha game I'll never drop money on this again, but at that spending level there should be some kind of guarantee beyond what they have set up. So good game but dont drop any money. Pull rates are stupid low."
I wish I got to learn how to play I was 9 when I started my career as a worker at age 9 by age 11 out of 1000 salesman for the Houston Post House number 7 in my parents said I can go on a car trip and pissed me off well and I guess you know the rest huh working machine man been out of work for a couple years .p to whom this may concern Michael O'Connor with the t in the middle stands for Thomas over and out. Dad if you're there I need your f****** help okay
"Solid gacha game with an even better storyline. A must-download for fans of the Fate franchise! Even if you aren't familiar with the Fate franchise this game is worth a go, it appeals to all fans, old and new. This is a very text-heavy game and it all centers around the storyline. Worth the amount of space it takes. Not the most F2P friendly, but I am F2P and play FGO everyday and get lots of enjoyment out of it. Definitely try this game out!"
Play this game or get tha yeet
Fun but it would be nice to be able to skip a lot of things instead of just story like add a skip button to summoning where it'll automatically just put all the servants and essences you get and also the tutorial. Also a blitz system for missions you've already done. Also a pity system for a 5 star maybe like 111 summons then 5 star and it gets reset if u get a 5 star before the pity takes effect. And also attack animations.
ims a games so my expierence all of people is related with games thanks for this games and enjoy with animw games thanks japan‚ô•
"As a fan of the anime, this game is addicting. Finally got THE Sabre. Strategy can be deep but you can also make do with just collecting your favorite characters."
So I changed my rating I lost all my characters that I had before but it was easy getting back on my feet and getting characters I love.
Outstanding
I dont know how I survived this game for 4 yrs man
"Keeps crashing constantly. Everytime i try to battle, the game crashes during the fighting animations, including during NPs. I really want to play this game without having to constantly restart the app."
I found interest in this game after watching Apocrypha. I've now played this game for about 1000+ days now. The combat is strategic with some gimmicks from time to time. The story gets good once you get past Septem and the most important of all: This game will place you through the stages of grief as you suffer rolling away your savings for your favorite png. You come to accept the loss as you slowly level your account. Very easy pick up and go game that isn't harsh on the battery.
"It's a really good game, I just wish it worked offline."
Peak game
Yet to see a five star Medusa
"Unable to load, entered the data transfer but still unable to load"
"Great stories. Fun and plentiful events. Well made art and characters. Can be grindy of course. There are a few welfare 4 star characters each year. Rare times of a guaranteed 5 star under certain conditions. Been playing for a few years now and have enjoyed my time, but very frustrating moments when the gotcha gods were not kind."
Fate Grind Order
Waifu 4 laifu
This is easily my favourite mobile game
Boobies
Update button where
Phenomenal game.
"I think this is the best gacha game on mobile, it's the first one that i actually felt like I could play without paying for anything"
Astolfo go brrr ...i still dont have him TwT 5/6/22
Give me illya Make bond gain easier Then it's peak
Very fun. Updates are odd though.
"If you are a fan of the fate franchise give this game a try. I love this game story and collecting my favorite servants. It's also very f2p friendly as in you need specific units to beat the game. If you are the person who likes wanting to pull on every characte, it is going to be expensive to play the game."
The best
I had a house once
just started it. this game is so good
"I've been playing this game for 1-2 years and wow this is a winner. This game has awesome turn based combat that reminds me of old ff games. The characters are all based on historical figures which in turn makes the characters pretty interesting. But of course the likeness isn't historical accurate, we got waifus in this bih. The waifus are what your aiming for the more waifus the more happy you are in life. Real life waifus are lame, get yourself a anime waifu today!"
I enjoyed it...
"Huge fan in player base, fun and unique story content, lots of different characters to collect, play and read about. Mythological character lore is a big appeal. It is a gacha game (gambling based for characters) and designed to be addictive, so be careful of that and that might be a known issue going in. Updates come out regularly, gameplay improvements coming forward form of character edits as well as game features and events. Good at keeping you engaged overall with lots of content."
"I REALLY hate this game from the bottom of my heart but I'm addicted to it so I can't stop playing, 4 years, 3300+ quartz, 10 paid gachas and I finally got mommy Raikou. I still hate this game."
save me from this hell
Do you like historical and real waifus unlike those fake ones then this is the game for you!
"Love this game to bits, but have spent way too much money on it."
"Very amog game,i like it"
Enuma elish
The games fun we'll I'm a fan of the fate series. Although it is a gatcha hell.
Gaca hell but still a cool game. Especially if you're a Fate fan.
Fix the na gacha pls
Waifu hell. Don't play for the combat.
Wasted my free time playing this game 10/10
Awesome game with an awesome story. Gacha has cancer level rates but you just need to play within your means. It's not pay to win so no worries
"So a few years ago, I deleted this after briefly playing it. But when I download and log in again to my old account, I saw a lot of log-in and missed events rewards into my reward-box, and I got instantly rich when I saved them all. For this, I rate this game 5 Stars, Thx for not deleting my saved experience."
A strongly recommended game for those who like turn based rpg and visual novel reading. And gacha.
"A deep dive into the works of Nasu, Higashide and Sakuria. A story rich and time investing game, the more time you spend farming and levelling up your servants, the easier and better gameplay is."
Character stories are fascinating but gets boring and repetitive outside of storyline and banners.
This is my favorite gacha game to play because of its awesome story and characters. It introduced me to a lot of my now favorite characters in any form of media ever!
Very enjoyable ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Please increase drop rates
Game is fun and my favorite anime
Ishtar is kept
Brilliant story and universe but the F2P experience is horrid the pull rates in the gatcha a miserable and the grinding amount is ridiculous because if low drop rates on lower difficulties so new players or players that don't have a strong sevent can't level or get stronger easily
Ok so I recommend FGO alot to my friends cause its addicting but yesterday my game said that game didn't load and I don't want to reinstall it and lose progress please fix it to the best of you can.
I don't have a life but at least I have Ishtar.
S Alwys stock in loading..
This game's cutscene can be sometimes long but can be very enjoyable to read and to pick which response to choice!
"Had alot of great memories playing this game (except not getting the 5 stars I want of course cuz of the rates yeah) , this is the only game that sticked with me for 3 years and most games I played doesn't even last 1 year. The reason why is cuz of the story(hella good) , the characters and their lores, and cuz its Fate duh. Also for new players, This is hell you're walking into."
This game is so cool
Don't play this game. You be walking into gacha hell and never come out the same. Good good otherwise.
Now i need help after transfering my save data from my old phone to the new one it crashed after the title screen please fix it for android 12
"I can't connect to server, keeps saying that I have no connection or make sure I have connection. Bruhhh. I'm currenly infront of my router and I have 100mbps."
My app keeps crashing I attpted to redownload and data transfer but it still crashes. From what I understand data transfer can only be done once. Is there a way to data transfer again
Anime seiyuu
I love the art and the story. It's a bit stale around the First parts especially Septem but the story gets WAY better in chapter 6 Camelot and the Lostbelts are phenomenal. You play this game for the story and the characters which are easily the Best part.
I wanted to play this but it's not letting me in not matter what
I need bought galaxy s22
"If you're serious about drop rate, make it real"
Note 10+ after os update game keep crashing
Good story have been playing it for several years. don't recommend it
The best game I have played. I lost it all today. Transferred the data to a new device only to find out that I had to return it. I could not get it back. Any tips on getting it back?
I lost everything when I had to replace my phone. No data is stored online unless you create a transfer code that can only be used once.
"Loved it I just wish there was a NP skip feature, because the NP animations felt repetitive almost instantly"
What happened? There's a glitch in this game. I was trying to select a button and then it also selects the other. Like it has multiple selection. I can't burn other Servants and tap the summon button properly. Please fix this.
it would be nice if we can make an account with password so we can just log in there whenever we want
I want to like this game but it won't let me. This is the 3rd time I've lost all my progress. It dosn't link with anything so if you switch devices or the game gets bugged and you re-install then goodbye account. And the team just ignores everyone's plea to fix this. I made it pretty far this time too üò≠
Great game! Only problem is sometimes it goes on a black screen and i have to restart the game.
I don't if i didn't play the game enough but it felt like i was just doing the same thing over and over.
I don't like it I'm so sorry I really thought this was an amazing game but in my opinion I don't like it I'm sorry
"The gameplay may not be the best but the story, characters, and ost are all enjoyable. I've been playing for 1 year now."
How to download hisüôÑüôÑ
"Amazing game! I've never played a mobile game for this long before, it really keeps you motivated to keep playing. One thing that would be really great though is that if you could have the ability to pin certain friends at the top of your support servant list. There's a lot of time wasting trying to refresh the support list trying to find that one person you want to use."
30 quartz for 1 single draw . . auto uninstall .!
"Gacha is reasonable, gameplay is good especially for TBS players. Lore is excellent, it is well thought. the only thing I think the game should have is monthly passes."
Daishouri
Please help me every time I launched the game it keeps on force closing
"Pog, can we get a saber Gilles buff though?"
"I'm sorry, but I can't support a game that relies on transfer codes and passwords to backup your saved game, when they have better ways to do it. Other app games let you link a secondary account. Transfer codes and passwords are old fashioned."
It's a great game but please do fix the crashing
"Good but ,the rates aren't"
It can be f2p friendly as long as you plan ahead of time and use resources wisely.
Don't stop until you reach camelot
"Amazing story. Amazing game play. Very unique and enjoyable. I do have some negatives. No pity system. The amount of buying quartz is extremely pricey for what you get. I am not saying to just hand out 5*s, but the rates should be better when you summon. But over all a really fun game to play. Still giving this a high star rating of 4."
Keeps crashing. Gilgamesh in particular will crash the game but just trying to select a level will see the game freeze up and become unresponsive.
"Pros: free!, great story, lots of awesome heroes to collect, easy to learn combat mechanics, fair drop rate on (most) items needed to level up characters, and fun rewarding events. Cons: very low drop rates on heroes, overpriced in game currency with no special offers or deals and my poor experience with customer service almost lost me my account. Overall: Great game! Especially for fans of the Fate series. 2022: Still going strong! Game is still great! Sadly, the cons haven't changed though."
It's going to be very bad.
I can't recover my account...sucks that most games save ur data from ur Google account... but not FGO.
Great game play and story lines. Tons of events and freebies throughout. If the game wasn't a challenge I wouldn't play.
"Casual gameplay, reaccuring banners, constantly updating story, free to play friendly"
Waiting for this rpg offline games
"Great game. I just wish there was the option to not have an assist. Because unlike other people I like challenges, being op just isn't that fun for me."
Slowly getting better over time...
"Pay to win, yet another toxic gambling game intended to circumvent laws against child gambling. Good job"
What's a lot of rubbish
gilgamesh
"Gacha will bring great despair. To those who don't know, it's hell your walking into. And for those who know will grind with the knowledge of greatness only a few will obtain."
great and all but ozymandias animation update when : (
"Basically free Visual Novel, with turn based rpg elements."
Temporary event charecter are a bad idea they should be permanent this game is trash
"This game is so fun! It's a bit of an exercise in patience with quite a lot of farming, but the story is a very rewarding experience that makes all the leveling worth it. The events are always light-hearted and fun, and this game has one of the best and easiest to follow tutorials I've ever seen. It's very easy to start, and very hard to put down."
Hopefully will start working on the new version of Android soon Edit: works great wicked fun
"I actually like this game but I'm curious on how to save your data from getting lost there's no account to link your data. It's only offer for transferring ,but how could you transfer if you can't save your data ???. I hope this would be fix soon so that we will continue to play this without losing the progress. Thank you."
Not worth to download this game. This is suck and a waste of time üò§üìå
"The game is good the graphic is good and the animation is good i mran by good is excelent, the only problem is the gacha hope that you seperated the freaking craft essence in the character or servent banner because everytime I wish on the servant banner I get the freaking craft essence, do you know how hard to get 30 saint quartz and just to get only a freaking 4* or 5* craft essence, sorry but I'm not buying a saint quartz online because it's freaking expensive, so hope you change the gacha sys"
BEST GAME BUT I ƒ∂EEP CRASHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good yeah good that's it its good
I Actually enjoyed playing this
Sick
"It's all good and easy to understand but it's just unfair bcuz JP server is more advanced and when finishing mission to campaign they give 1 SQ shard and other server only get saint quarts after finishing whole area or section, I don't have any problem with the game I just want to say it's unfair for other server players"
"Pay to Win, story need tons of premium servants just to progress the story."
Still a absolutely wonderful game!
This game is so good (people say) anyways this game is so sus 69 mbü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ì
"Magnificent story , amazing character design , and best vas even coming from the anime and also its a f2p but gacha is hell (but its all part of the charming) this is the only mobile game i play and recommend it to anyone . Also im fan of fate anime 10/10"
Its addictive but its also one of the worst gatcha rates in town.
I love it so very cool
My Favorite.. Keep it Up üëç
You're making a game that is hard to clear. Imagine the enemy's hp is 200k and after every turn it heals 2 million hp and my damage is only 150k for 3 max level heroes and I use their NP with full attack up buff. Now tell how can you clear that game? Maybe you should check it. It is so unfair. It is impossible to beat.
Rates are garbage compared to the majority of other gatcha games. Just used up all the SQ I have saved up over the past 2 years just to get absolutely nothing. Already was thinking of quitting the game before but this is the final nail in the coffin. Just save yourself some time and play anything else other than this outdated pile of trash.
I don't know what to say it's so good
"Awesome game, but I wish characters could be better obtainable."
Oh how I love Fate. Playing over 2 years. Only gacha game that I'll probably ever love this much
Give us MORE SQ PLEEAAAASSSEEE!!!
Idk
Aw yeaaah Tamamo-no-Wifey
"The developers keeps deleting my review because of seeing a 1 star. What the heck guys? - False advertisement and event rewards for cash grab and bait. - Very, very low characters to get and what you get are terrible ones. - progress doesnt feel too accomplishing. - You need money to even get decent characters. - Game keeps lgging when entering or even confirming literally anything you do in the game."
"It's alright, truthfully. That said, as someone that mainly plays another game of a similar type known as Epic Seven, it feels like a step down to play Fate/GO. In comparison to Epic Seven, it dips in quality in most areas and is far more egregious with its greediness to the point where it feels a little oppressive to be honest. Its most redeeming qualities seem to be its story(for the most part) and the novelty of playing with your favorite characters from the series and from history."
Great game imo esp if you love Fate series
Worst games it stop
Gud game
Great game. The stories are intriguing and are easily understood even if you have no prior knowledge of the fate universe. No ads and there isn't any pressure to make any purchases. So far I don't have any complaints.
the good wifi but the game is still failed connect fix ur game
Please add skip tickets ember grinding is the worst. Now crashing constantly. Doesn't even open anymore.
"Very good gacha game, but it's a gacha game so..."
Good time burner
"Game hasn't aged well. If you're thinking about trying it out, skip it and play more modern gacha title."
No pity system for years despite nearly all modern gacha games having a pity system for gacha. Great story but it takes tike to ramp up. There is no auto battle function so grinding is a chore.
"Nice. Damn Gacha though. I have lost my streak several times because it takes a while to actually realize it needs to update. Lost a 400+ streak before, big sad."
Biggest mistake of my entire life was reading the fate visual novel. That was before I downloaded this game. üòê
good game. lots of waifu material. half tempted to sell my car for jalter. gg edit: nvm didnt need to sell my car. LMAO
One of the best games i've played so far
"This game is perfect...... If you exclude the gacha. Do i recommend? Nah For those planning to try fgo, this is hell lol"
"Is amazing. Very fun strategy game of rock paper scissors. Edit: I re-installed the game, but it keeps telling me it can't connect to thr server."
There is only gacha
Love this game!
"The game has a good story and events. The content is generally good but it has the worst gacha system there is. The 5 star and 4 star rates on rate up are obviously inaccurate(much lower than what they show) there is no pity system, you can spend 1000+ quartz($500) on a banner and still not get the character you want. It's that bad. But if you just want to enjoy the story go ahead but just don't spend money on it. Trust me it's a waste, if you buy quartz use them as golden apples, it's better."
"The game doesn't age well over years. Even the main story kinda fell off after season 1. Then the outdated gotcha system just stinks harder with years. Especially during pandemic, it's so depressing just to get craps from pulls as well as one can only exchange these craps to other craps. This game doesn't even have mercy to offer some decent exchangeable items. After all , when will we have a major system update?"
Worst summon rates of any game. Gameplay is also just boring; for me personally.
It's fun to learn about human history as well as important people from the past
I came back into game. All of the memories are coming back to me of how hairyankingly annoying rerolling is. I reroll to get EMIYA but all I get is always Herc which is weird cause you think because there are 10servantsthere's a random chance you'd get EMIYA from the tutorial roll but as far I've reroll like about 10 of them has Herc(Don't get me wrong Herc is good but my first starter was Herc so I wanna change it up a bit).I can manage with grinding but it's always at the start I have problems
love this game im not a bot
I love the attacks of the servants. The storyline is exactly like the series but with your name said. Its fun when you get a new servant then you can make them stronger. It's making me sound like a kid wow.
"Damn, the gacha rates in this game is one of the worst I've seen so far."
"The game itself is fun, but recently the game has been crashing like no tomorrow. I can barely play the game because it crashes every single time. At this rate, I won't be able to keep my Temporary Tamamo because of how much the game meet crashing. Please fix this."
"I've been a long-time fan of RPGs and anime. This game blends both of those interests into a mobile gaming experience like no other. I have played it off and on since 2014 and highly recommend it to anyone who has been searching for a fun, addictive, beautifully crafted mobile role-playing experience. Also, it can appeal to more than just fantasy RPG and anime fans as many of the characters have a basis in our world's history (albeit a fictionalized one), as well as providing potential waifus."
Great game perfect balance of fun a history
This game makes me greatly suffer but I also cannot stop playing...
No Scathach feels bad man
It's a great game but you do eventually get burned hard. Happens to the best of us. Still it's a good game. Salty or not. The beginning translation needs work. The animations got updated but there's a few typos in Orleans still. Honestly it still holds interest many years later and continues to focus on story content. Minus one star for losing 1200 Saint quartz and 130 tickets to not get summer archer.
unable open the game after update
"While it's a good game it's REALLY starting to show its age. With all the QoL and gameplay improvements over the years in the gacha game market FGO really needs to catch up. It's banner system, event style, rewards system, and grinding are all outdated. But despite all that it's an enjoyable experience even if you aren't a type moon fan. The characters are nice, the story is good, and it's updated frequently which is rare nowadays for old gacha games. Just hope the give us the pity system early."
"This isn't a terrible game however the story is so incredibly and needlessly slow. Missions are extremely repetitive. Among the games out there that have a gacha system, I've never experienced one as sketchy as this one. Furthermore, similar to how other gacha games work, in order to be ""good"" you must get good servants. I've played on and off for about 5 years. I haven't paid a dime to the game and that's very apparent in my lack of good servants and rng. Wish drop rates were better."
Save yourselves
They got girls with nice asses
Good game but needs an arena
ur mom
"I think the game has some of the best mechanics and summoning style possible, but losing ur data in the game is too easy to lose, I've restarted 3 times by now and transferring data is so weird"
"Its a gacha game... Gacha rate is bad but everything else is good. The story is great, the charecters are good, and in all i love it. Been playing for about a year and say that this game is good."
THE GMAE IS SOO GOOD BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN I GET BACK MY ACCOUNT PLZ I WORKED SO HARD AND HAD SO MUCH STUFF AND FOR IT ALL TO BE GONE BECAUSE AND UPDATE CORRUPTED MY GAME FILES AND MY CODE TO NOT WORK IS BS PLZZ HELP!!!!
Pretty poggers ngl
good enough
It is a fantastic game I just wish it was a little easier to get gold cards
The fact that other people gets confused by the story blows my mind you guys might need to read english more.
"Great game, love it but it all still requires a bunch of rng but thats whats fun"
GILGAMESH!!!!!
I love it wish the missions were just to clear on th first time but overall great game.
Hot
Keeps on crashing
Nice Game and story details but sometimes the game crashes randomly
Nobunaga is my waifu
"Played this Game since 2017 and it was my first Gacha game although I was warned it would be hell, it was true but there can be heaven also."
"Oh gacha lord, I surrender myself to you."
Fun and addicting nothing else just that good
Fun Hero style gatcha game. Loved the series before the game. Game is just extra fun for me!
"Really great story and characters as well, any Fate fan would be able to pick it up and just enjoy it for what it is. It's not very F2P friendly when it comes to getting SSR Servants, but the game can still be played using 1-3 star Servants if one has farmed enough to max the most essential Servants to have from the 1-3 star pool."
"I am playing for almost year and a half, I guess the game is great. But try to add more content. After the event, and doing the free quest and story, there's nothing more to do."
I have spent over 1100 hours of my life on this game and am willing to spend 100x this amount.
Beautiful
I dont know anymore i got the servants i want and raised them
"Gameplay and graphics are a little dated, but by far the best writing in gacha once you get to Camelot"
"This game will make you sleepy , too many connecting , lots if character but u can only use two."
"A game that quite honestly hasn't aged well in terms of gameplay, but retains players with story and characters. That said, the aforementioned story and characters are top notch."
thats hell you're walking into
Full stars cause I'm a masochist
I like this game i rate 5 star
"Absolutely beautiful game, I love it so much, please please please don't ever take this game off the store, such a masterpiece, super keen for all the japan features to catch upto na, love you work :))"
Ehe
"Its a fun game to waste some time on, if i would say something that i dont like about it, it would be how grindy it is"
Rates.
"Even after the recent update I still can't login, this sucks, this happened during the April 1st update as well, my phone is OppoA37f and I'm not the only one with this problem."
Amazing game I love this! üòç
"let this be the absolute last fate content you indulge in, do not enter FGO too soon or you will never complete the other fate content"
Love the story but not easy
"The game is super good especially the gameplay and the story, there's only one problem for me it's the summon rate it's too low on getting the servant you need.. no offense for those who plays the game.. I"
Um if you are planning to leave this game temporarily I suggest you don't do that. this game is great I love it but my phone started to become full and I need to uninstall some apps. I un installed this game and the moment that I tried to play this game again my last progression is gone. sadge. I will be forced to quit this game now. and please don't uninstall this game if you get bored of it. you will lose your hard-earned progression. I lost many waifus because of my stupidity.
amazing thx for free ssr
The only game still in my phone
‚úåÔ∏è
Pretty good game
My ratiing/post was deleted so the positives I gave it last time are out the window. This company is terrible and absolutely does not care about you as a customer(for p2p) or user(f2p). The app has multiple issues on different phones. This gacha is notorious for messing people over. People in the community have spent thousands in it and received nothing. I cannot recommend enough to stay away from this game.
The game summon sucks so bad it made me want to quit this game overall the rate up sucks and barely any 4 or 5 star popped up and expect me to pay for quartz to get them
"Saint quartz are pretty difficult to get and when something like messenger chat heads open it freezes. It also freezes randomly and no the phone doesnt freeze, its only the game that freezes."
Loading too much... uninstall to then install again...SSR drop rate sucks
"Good story, backgrounds, characters too ( bad ones as well) overall its a great turn based game with nice story, but really want you to grind/farm materials and currency 90% of the time."
ITs a great game but best to increase summon rate too many 3 star little 4 star almost zero 5 star its a bit of a hard time for players with no income
"Slow loading time, didn't open eventually"
5/5 ruined my life.
I can't play or log in to it... Please.... Fix...
"It's a game where you collect heroes, and then you can't see your heroes because the UI is bloated."
I love this game!!
Trash gacha game erased my progress and my servants. Never waste any time on this.
Transfering data on this game is horrible. You can't even play the game on more than one device. Now I'm in the situation of possibly losing my data. Please fix your system; it's not efficient.
"If you're too much of a meta guy, you will not have fun. You will only have fun if you play around your favs or the ones you have fun with, or unless you have money, and if you're not too hard on the grind, if so you'll hate the game quickly. I have a love-hate relationship with it"
5 star servant ticket
"I would give it 0 stars if I could. Early game is ""lol use a Hercules support"" and late game is an endless grind to make anybody even remotely usable. Upgrade item drop rates are utterly abysmal and for any servant above 3* you could be grinding for DAYS for even one single skill rank increase. Combat is generally sluggish and unsatisfying, and the immense amounts of grinding you have to do goes relatively unrewarded for the effort involved. Trash game, do not play it."
"Lasagna pls add a free 5star ticket in JP this year 2022 and do limited servants next, I want free qin Shi quang"
LETS GO! FATE is LIFE!
"This is probably the best mobile game I've installed. I was already a big fan of the Fate franchise, and the story and characters of this game are really well written. The gameplay is very in depth and gives a lot of control regarding the kinds of teams you can build. The one problem I can say this game has is the gacha summon rates. The 5 star servants can be really difficult to get, but I found that even 4 star and lower rarity servants can carry you through the story as long as you're smart."
Ruined my life. Literally had to give my all to delete this thing.
Audio stutters for MIUI 12.
Way funner than playing Roblox all day + my favorite anime and actually is VERY entertaining.
Caenis my Beloved
"Honestly it's not a bad game. Just needs time and dedication. The only con is, the gacha is absolutely hell. There's no such thing as a pity system. Be prepared to pray and destroy wallet to get your waifu. 9/10 wouldn't recommend as a gateway to gacha games. Try any other game with a pity system. Edit: Theres now a semi pity system, gacha still hell"
I enjoyed the game but I cant play it (takes a very long time to load) I can play with mobile data but not WiFi please help
"If you enjoy story-driven games and you're NOT playing this game, you're doing yourself a disservice."
There is no auto battle?
nice graphics nice story and nice costumes for astolfo
Excellent
Nice game and exceptional graphics. But I just uninstall it because I'n not really into turn based games
"So far my experience has been pretty good, I love the Fate franchise to begin with so, obvious bias. (I mean, look at my pfp) Been playing for a little over 3 months and have had a blast. If you pick up this game, I wish you good luck"
The game itself is good I'm enjoying the gameplay although the only problem is when u summon a servant the rate up is very low and bad tbh I myself want more than just one SSR I'm aiming for musahi Jeanne alter and Ishtar although I feel sad I could not get Romulus quirinus at all therefore the rate ups are bad I hope to get an SSR and it's at the rate up but not only one but more thanks for listening
"great game, i hate the binding system...i can't access my account anymore because the phone I'm currently using got broken and it says i should continue playing it there...i paid sq and plaued there for a year now...i wanted to cry i don't know how to get it back..."

Berry Bed GEME
Good service
"Besides the money I spent on multiple accounts, I now have a crippling gambling addiction. Thank you lasagna and aniplex."
I redownloaded the game after walking away from it for several months only to come back and it crashes after a minute of combat everytime. Im sure this could be fixed with a patch but for me this is unplayable due to crashes.
Smooth loading waste of time
"The perfect crossover of history and fantasy through this challenging, fun and frustrating game. 100% recommended for anime fans and whales."
When it comes to turn based card games this beats them all easily
"Just fix your rates, be more f2p friendly and this would be a wayy better game"
App consistently freezes when Saber uses her extra attack in the tutorial battles. Reinstalled app and cleared the cache and everything.
"It looks like my original review post was deleted. GG. Way to pad rating stats. 4/7/22 edit: Game still leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the gameplay. This doesn't mean it's a bad game; it's good, just very dated. Also, while there are different modes, each one uses the same stamina, which is in short supply, limiting play time. Try using other types of energy for other modes, especially for those awesome events."
Great game with an interesting weeb story that'll keep you busy for an extremely long time. No pity so the game can actually be terrible if you have been saving for a year and dont get unit. I also said I would give 5 stars when it would fit on my phone screen and it does now so here is 5 star rating.
The summon rate to get a 4 or 5 rank servant can be very better because literally it is hard to get them
Gooditis
"Amazing game, the story, combat, ui, characters, and art come together to form a cohesive, and enjoyable ride. It's my favorite play store game ever."
"Was a good game. But, I quickly got bored"
"I can't play the new lostbelt at this rate. The game keeps crashing everytime a character or a enemy do a certain animation. It got to the point where I had to remove a character from my team. My phone shouldn't be the issue, It's a galaxy s10e. I'm losing my mind"
The rate up is a lie spent 300SQs no rate servant nor CE dropped
Saber go brr
Its been great so far
I HATE FATE
"gotta love the story and the gameplay, my favourite part was in Shinjuku singularity.."
"Huge gaming, that red hair guy goes crazy"
It was fun.
Constant crashes and freezing
Pretty good I haven't played it but It's pretty Awesome! Haha

"I love it but i wish u can do separate summon like servant summon, craft essentse summon and code summon it will be easier but also need the increase drop rate at the farming"
Fate grand order is literally the only gacha game my cheeto infested hands will touch
The game are still not working since March 31 update. Please make a fix of it don't turn a blind eye on players who also LOVES FGO .. Please make an announcement or something about this to lighten this players despair.
"I haven't played it but by the app,s icon picture and the reviews it sounds like a pretty good game"
I had to edit my original review of 3/5 a couple of years ago. As someone who still isnt super into the fate series as a whole this game has gotten a lot better objectively as far as beginner rewards and giving new players a fair shot at getting decent characters to grind with and give incentive to go for 5 stars. Rates are still abysmal and I still dont like that there's no auto feature through story modes. Overall i thought it was updated well enough to give it a fair review in 2022
"stuck on connecting forever, i keep retrying for almost 2 weeks and its still stuck, how am i supposed to play this game?"
Game has been freezing up and crashing lately. Cant even get passed the login bonus screen half the time....
"Amazing world building, and story telling"
"Con game r√°c , Skadi c·ªßa tao ƒë√¢u"
Best Mobile Game on the market better than most console games still to this day!
After the update yesterday the game has stopped working. Please look into fixing it. Many people seem to be having the same problem as I. Thank you.
This is fine
Ok game play but the grind to get currency is easily the worst outa any gacha game out there
~100 pulls. Neither banner character and only 1 4-star
Excaliburrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!
Very nice pretty f2p friendly and plot is really good
"Game is starting to show its age, is good for the story but the gameplay is not very fun."
Rate up is not a lie
Updates in play store are tedious.
10/10 best game I ever play during my life time. :)
"If you are into Fate series/franchise this game will surely give you enjoyment. Stories are well-written, character lores are also good. The downside of this gacha game is that it has no pity system - It all goes to your luck. But still, you can finish stories/quest with jus average servants which you could get on free rolls (and some of them are actually better than SSR's of their class) and with the help of your friends as support."
Been a fan of Nasu's work from when I first watched stay night on '17. DW managed to make a good pseudo spin-off game based on his works and it made me love the game even through the nature of it being a gacha f2p game. TY Aniplex!!
Good is all I have to say other than the fact that the apocrypha drop rates are simi-horrible spent 546 saint quartz on it and only got 1 which was Jack
I'd say it's my favorite.
"My absolute favorite game for 5 years. Plays like a video game, you really forget that it's an app. It has an unforgettable story that somehow keeps getting better. And it is NOT pay to win, they give you enough in game currency that you can roll for the servants you want. Every New Year's they have a one-time promotion where for 15 paid saint quartz you're guaranteed a 5 star servant. I buy that every year, but it isn't expensive and it's a choice, you don't have to do it. I really recommend it"
"Whelp, just when i'm about to hit 300 log in days in a row, these new devs release an update that breaks the game. I'm on an emulator and when I open the game I can't load past the first screen. You know this really sucks, I only came back to this game after I stoped playing after my previous 200 day in a row log in only because DW were amazing devs that never gave a broken patch or had me worry about trash like this happning. New devs definitely aren't DW. F. Guess I'll wait 4 sf6 shoutout2ONO."
A very fun game
Came for the Waifu. Stayed for the story and characters. Overall a good experience.
"Great game and its story, starting slow to interesting. And i do get what i wanted just by playing for free"
"Amazing game, storyline is topnotch AND NOT ur 'chosen hero' kinda stuff. Drop rates are terrible(sw lvl terrible) but at least they tell u it. Understand that rate up DOES NOT MEAN higher 5* rates; it only means that WHEN you get a 5*, that 5* has a higher chance of being the rate up one. This game has very good balance. A quick yt search would reveal ytubers like Green and Plushie who showcase lineups that can clear the hardest content in the game using lower rarities. High Investment Game!"
"As a fate fan, this game does it justice"
"The story and side missions/events are great! Made me really get into the fate series! I love the graphics too! Only annoying thing is summoning, but I've gotten enough servants through their events that it's fine."
"Hey Devs, I been playing this game for some time now and I love it and respect you guys. So please help me because your app keep crushing when I open it. Please"
"The game overall is pretty good. The game itself is enjoyable. The servers are 2 years behind Japan's, but that's only because the game was originally intended for only being released there. The game is stable and it has a good plot to it. It can be pretty funny at times, overall really enjoyable. Some characters are completely obsolete, though. Rates are awful but you can still beat the game with only 1*-3s* and welfares."
"Story is good, the gatcha wrecks my soul to the core. Every banner for eresh i've saved up to not get her. Why oh why üò≠"
"It makes my phone heat up to an alarming temperature. Playing for 15 minutes, my phone gets hot enough to cause first degree burns."
Forced tutorials and horrible draw rates as well as restrictions on the player on who you can and can't use because of a point system. Not worth the time to play.
"Good for time-killing, if I can make a request, please create kotomine kirei that is playable"
"If you love waifus and a boring grind then this game is for you. I wish I could take back the money spent on this game, dropped about $200 total on this game trying to roll for my favorite character throughout my 3 years playing this game. The gacha is the worst than any gacha game ever, the grind is very long while the gameplay is mid which makes the grind a bit boring. I love the fate universe and all it's characters but just go watch the anime or play the extella games or even the VN."
RRROOOOMMMMAAAA!!
"I had a good 3 year run with this game. Finally stopped playing because the farming got too repetitive for me but I did have a good time. The worst thing about this game is just like any other gacha, the rates for summons. I did get a majority of the servants I wanted. Had fun using all the characters but I felt it was my time to quit. Also there's a story, but I skipped that, wasn't invested in it Edit: I'm back, I can't help it"
"Great gameplay, great characters, and overall a great experience with the story and events. 5/5 would recommend to anyone."
good gacha game
Rarely experience crashes. The game works as expected. Gacha rates are kinda bad but maybe I'm just unlucky. I still got some 5 stars and some during rate ups so it's not all bad.
Good game but the rate for some characters is way to low like a 5* rate for a 4*
I love the game its really good high quality VA's story is nice I would recommend the game to update the ui its kind of outdated and pls add a download button or option on CE and servants grafitti
Excellent game!
"10/10 would not recommend. The gacha is fine(at least for me, i got several ssr with just tickets and im f2p), the game requires a lot of grinding, the story is great and some quests have intresting mechanics but after completing the story and events, the game gets boring(although the story is very long and events happen every month so you wont get bored easily)."
Fgo I've played for a while gacha can be fair if you have patience saving your saint Quartz for one you don't need every servant that has great assets or look cool just enjoy the story and play the game
"A fantastic story with great characters. Some designs are way too fanservice-y for my taste, but nothing much I can do since it's a game made for horny bros. Has very simple gameplay and is a breath of fresh air among complicated new gachas nowadays."
Not very f2p friendly
"Been playing since the beginning. Nexon/Blue Archive could learn a lot from Aniplex about how to handle a gacha game, because this is perfection."
"Very Good, Simpably characters *nose bleeds*"
This game is obsessed with forcing you to watch unskippable slow cutscenes and making you move super slow. The cards you get in this game are a joke. All 4 star and 3 star cards that do nothing and this game is a rip off of tales of link. Plus the special moves in this game are way too hard to get and the animation takes too long. Just a bad game in my eyes.
Tried it spent over 1 hour and still had the tutorial going .....sad so sad
U guys should add a auto feature other than that it's a good game ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I have had this game for years and the disappointing thing is you can only access your data transfer from your previous phone. There should be more ways to access previous game play because phones die, etc. Why isn't information connected to my Google play account or via my email so a pin or password can be used to transfer the data? I don't even know if anything for the game is saved if I back up my phone on a hard drive. Plus, you can only use the transfer once from your previous device."
Needs all that updates please update it really good and make it really cool make character looking into the dark fire Ninja and fire and water and ice and earth makeup fire nice and water and everything job and a night time and more update tonight with it If you send more free stuff to me thinking send me more diamonds and rings and money and it all hurting me
Easily the best story and characters of any gacha game. They're so good I wouldn't feel uncomfortable comparing them to stories/characters from real games
I played this for yearsüòÑ
Sakura Matou is best girl
Would have given it 5 stars but the tutorial is really dumb. It's so long and repeatitive.
"Its ok i guess, not fnaf tho."
It is has a good story for a mobile game
This game is a money taker. Did 5 draws and got no 4 star character's. Only got thos banners. Don't get this game unless y want to wast your time.
"Gameplay : 4* Playable w/out $?: 2.5* Graphic: 4.5* Music: 4.5 Overall: I have alot to say about this game, but to summarize, this is a true gacha hell and but if your willing to pull through and overlool that flaw and experience the story. Its beautiful. PS: Lasengle, please improve the pity system on this game or increase the rate on 5* instead of a .8% on their banner."
sexy anime women
"I have no idea how people like this game. The Fate franchise is the only thing carrying it. Not going to mention how bad the rates are. The gameplay is utter trash, its not an rpg. You attack with whatever servant that it tells you are allowed to. Every skill is on a super long cooldown. Enemies do not follow the rules, the MC is boring weakling who cant do anything. Mash is boring and one dimensional, no one had any personal motivations or goals. Story is regressive, you lose over and over."
I loved the game ...before i had to change phones and lost all my progress and 5 star heroes.
Okay but got a new phone and lost everything much rather they update it so you can login with play store or smth
"Good game, can be a bit frustrating at times but overall fun"
"property best gotcha game, did have good time playing this game, only problem is I lost my account and Is VERY hard to get it back, so don't lose your account like me guys and I hope in the future they can have a better account connect."
This game so much bug i can not play i was gonna start
Impossible to reclaim my past master account. Do your fans a favor and allow them to link their accounts to their master profile so they don't lose all their data in case their phone messes up.
Low pity rate
Best turn based game in the world hands down!
I honestly have a love/hate relationship with this game
I like the game and story
Too hard to play
"Overall everything is great; the story, designs tho some can be too erotic but no problem, the servant lore, and the gacha if you want suffering towards gacha. The only problem are sprites and animation update since some servants kept their animations since the beginning of the game. Give them a makeover and more costumes. The content may be repititive to strengthen your servants but great."
"The gameplay and story is ok(until you reach the lostbelts), but when it comes to summoning it's a bunch of bull.You get more craft essences than you get characters and it only gets you real angry when you do a multi-summon and get only 4 star craft essences and not a single 4 or 5 star charecter."
"Amazing game, have put it down and come back a few times but this time around with the new 10+1 summon I've stayed quite longer. Although, since the latest update I've done 11 summons and I still have not received my 4 star card. Either I'm blind or something is wrong with the system"
"Could be a great game but you have to spend money if you want to enjoy the game or get even a close chance to maybe get the character you want, drop rates are almost impossible."
"My rating comes by way of the game pretty much not having a way to save my progress after it tells me that uninstalling and redownloading won't delete my progress, but 2 times now that's been the case. It's frustrating to have to keep going through the learning process over again because the devs decide to do updates and the downloaded data that is put in to the game via patch update screws up my progress after clearing cache"
. |
"Hello I'm new to this game. there's a problem when logging in, it keeps connecting even tho my net is strong"
"The combat is pretty straight forward and the art and graphics has only improved since i first downloaded this app. But there are severe downsides, for example, no autoplay you can't farm in game currency from doing the story, drop rates are abysmal even with supposed 4 star ssr drop rate ups for banners etc. Prices for the diamonds or w.e the currency is are so high too plus i don't understand how ive gotten more 4 star characters from summon tickets than multis. This game needs some real work."
It's a really good game üéÆ
"Uninstalled the app. No fix was done regarding the sounds and now I can't even connect properly. After clearing cache, data, and re-downloading, it's still the same. Guess the game doesn't want me to play it anymore."
this game has the worst gacha rates out of all i have played. its so bad
You will never pull what you want but sometimes the gems are what you dont want.
Definetely not biased
Solid game but on occasion when I try to open the app it leaves me on a blank screen forever and I have to uninstall and reinstall for it to work The losing all progress
Haven't been able to play even though I love FGO. It says to update in the Google play store but I can't. Have tried to reinstall a few times but it gives me the same message. Please fix
Fun!! Even for free to play people like me üòÄ
Froze up a lot
Twitch prime
"It's a lot, but it's so worth it. Great plot, simple but challenging gameplay, supportive community, and all for a free game where each summon includes a lovable character that is witty and charming."
"What a ride of a game. Been playing since near the beginning of N/A's release. It's perfectly playable as a free to play game and most story arcs are worth reading. Newer players might become frustrated by the grind heavy nature of this game as they struggle to catch up to the current story, also rolling for new servants will also be an annoyance as the newer servants require materials not farmable until later in the story."
Been a good 6 years
Still needs a pity system and more opportunities for saint quartz
Pls give me sq
"I'm a fan of whole fate series, some are animated, some you can read on the story line on this game."
"Love the game, no pvp BS is the way to go."
Love the game played for 2 years now and love all the characters and event the game has the only thing that bothers me is that its a bit harder to get saint quartz
My only main issue with the game is that grinding for upgrade materials is annoying. They don't drop as often as you would like. This makes leveling your servants skills and ranks a bit of a chore. Especially if you choose to be a free to play person like me (nor spend real money for ingame materials) The game is a bit more generous when it comes to quart crystals needed to summon 5 star servant than other gacha games. For new players do some quick research on which servant you want to roll for
THANK YOU SO MUCH! üôè THIS GAME IS AMAZING!
"This game is very fun to play, lots of characters to choose from, nice story and good character design. The only bad thing is that is very scary to play in school lol"
I can't hear any music at all after latest update
Not a mobile game person. This is the exception
Pls just give us a pity system other than the USO edit: now make it better lol
Soooo goooooooood
Thank you for saber astolfo you deserve a 5 star review
A good visual novel and game. The rates will hurt a tho.
"doest work, says app outdated but just downloaded it... this should be impossible in any rational distribution/server system so i must assume the entire game will be garbo anyways."
Wong edan saiki
"If you ever wanna play this game, just remember, that's hell you're walking into."
Nice game just want to request more senarios to come
Pretty standard gacha game. Only good way to get high amounts of crystals quickly is through event login bonuses and that's not really good.
After you updated again? I cannot open the game..even thru play store.
"The main pull of the game is its story. It's brilliant! Great characters and world building with some excellent music to go along with it. However it's gacha rates are horrible so good luck trying to get the servant you want. Also the game play is a lot to be desired. It's not bad per se, but it's very lacking. I'm not good at describing the gameplay but if you look at some YouTube videos that will give a great idea on how the system works. So play for the story."
The greatest story that everyone needs to hear.
I love the game no big changes needed the game is already very good but I really recommend changing the UI its kind of outdated plus can u add a download option on the pictures of craft essence and servants I really want the grafitti
Why did you guys remove the game in VietNam?
"Its fate, what did you expect? Not a 5 star?"
Gachaaaa
"The rolling infuriates me when I don't have enough quartz, the farming can be tedious... I love this game so much I would give it 6/5 if I could"
"Peak fiction, peak characters, peak OST... all of it. And this isn't even its final form!"
Al I can say is Gilgame-
Ok.
"Great Game excellent Graphics and Great Story Line, Great Battle Scene Expecially The Noble Phantasm Part, Excellent Voiceline of Each Character, And Great Character Background And Especially The Character Design, The Only Problem For Me is The Gatcha, Which Is I Always Get Craft Essence Which Really Annoy Me"
Crashes on startup.
Awesome.
why am i keep playing this horriable gacha game it's been four years and i still can't stop playing plz help me i'm really tired of farming.
"Beautiful game , amazing story 10/10 would recommend."
"Not bad, it's rlly good and kinda addictive and it's also free to play (if you grind/play enough)"
"This game is absolutely awesome great graphics one of the best combat mechanics and more, but my only criticism is the summoning and ingame currency. It is kind of hard to get the ingame currency unless you grind a lot and the drop rates are kind of low overall though, it's a great game."
No female gil. Garbage game
Havent experienced bugs until now and this game is good Classic and not messy
Great Game. Very fun.
"Been playing for 2 weeks+, when I reached the 3rd singularity, the game stopped working, I tried reinstalling but still didn't work. I have my transfer code ready, I'm just waiting for tge game to work again so I can continue playing because I really liked the game"
I love the fate animes so much I am so glad that I found this game
2 stars only because their to slow connecting when it's just easy
im having difficulties in starting the game like it qlways want me to restart and i cant download it.
10/10 would Angra Mainyu again.
I'm changing my review with a one star I have signed in two weeks straight till yesterday. I can't sign in or do anything it's not right we lose our login days because you all want fix the bugs. I want my login fixed. This makes two times in two months this has happened. Fix your app. And I upgraded my rateing.
Nce game
"This game is a nice time sink, but the rates on any given summon are so hilariously terrible I highly recommend new players away from this game, lest they be duped out of their hard earned money."
Goog
Only here for astolfo Daddyüòçü§§ü§§üò´üò©
Best gacha game I've ever played.
Saw astolfo in a maid costume and installed immediately
"Been playing it since 2017 till now. The game is amazing. Nice story, amazing animation and interesting strategy game. At times I do stop playing for a couple of months but eventually I will always come back to the game. Gacha rate is low but I guess that's the exciting part of it, a sense of happiness when you get a character you're looking for."
Even slower after update
Its allmost april i hope i could get gilgamesh on April 27 as My Birthday present But still im gratefull for the character i have but Getting Gilgamesh is Another level of Joy in Fate/Go or Fate series he's the only character i like i dont know why but the more i look at gilgamesh the more i want him Ofc that's the Archer Gilgamesh 5 star even just Give some insane luck of getting gilgamesh im fine with that but still im gratefull so thank's For everything and i hope for y'all best FGO Foreverü§ù
"Cant even make it past ""connecting"" screen. My WiFi is perfect and I restarted my phone many times. Please fix."
"The support contact system did a great job to retrieve my lost account, thank you!"
"Updated: I have 5 star Astolfo, now... Will he get a swimsuit skin or version?"
Game is self is ok. Lots of rng. But ui just sucks. Jesus its cluster beep
Updated and lost my account.
"Ever since this latest update, the app has been freezing during battles and kicking me completely of the game."
I lost my accoumt few days ago. And i ask support to help me recover my account. They are very helpful and jn a few days i got it back. Best game ever
FGO CRASH TOO MUCH MY MORDERED AND MELTY MAJE MY BOOTYHOLE ICH AND NUTS QAUZK BUT CRASH ANNOYING OLEASE FIX. GOOD DAY GENTLEMAN.
Gacha rate is so bad
Idk if this is good thing or bad thing coz for some reason my game crashes everytime i go to summon circle
hi jhikhhu
"I did delete the game for a long time and reinstall the game last year and logging in is no problem, but on this year, I delete the game and reinstall back for 5 days and I can't log into my account and it said ""The transfered number is already in use"". Does someone literally stole my account? I beg you please retrieve my account back or recover it."
Hi so im a fan of fgo but the problem is this app google play i cant even doawnload or update google play fix your problemüò©üò©üò©üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†üò†üí¢üí¢
Fate is good and so is this game.
Best waifus
Best game for me
This is a p2w game no doubt when it comes to summons the good one are locked behind a pay wall which is scum like
In my app there is a error in this update i can't open the game
You started my addiction to these type of games
Gacha is bad civilization
"I like the game, but grinding for materials and stuff can be boring, any chance for a auto play/battle setting? Like when its your turn it gives you 10 second to do what you want and then the servants auto attack the enemy(maybe make it a option setting), it'd make it easier to focus less on it while also doing something else!"
This game is officially on my favorite list and is one of the best games out there
For me it's chapter 4 when it gets interesting. Game play wise its not anything special but its the simple game play that makes it easy for me to do something else while playing. The story is also engaging and the events make it worthwhile the only wish i have is them to make the yellow mana prism more obtainable.
Awesome game love the story and diverse charecters please have it possible to gain more event exclusive servants whose events are gone like cha-cha otherwise solid üéÆ.
Gacha still bad need better pity now.
Rate up is a lie!!! XD
"Needs more cute boys, too many women"
4year and a half now lol none stop.....
Coz I'm in too deep
"Waifus and great story, obviously the only problem would be the rates on 5 stars are a little small. There's also no pity system so that is obviously a problem."
Financially ruined me :)
Great game I developed overwhelming obsession with history and gambling
It's a great game but man the precent of getting ssr or even Sr is so low but it has a great sound track great character design great voice actors but it can get a little boring especially when you have to do one quest over and over and over again
Wonderful storyline with amazing characters. I love this game. Though because of the drop rate of the gatcha I can't recommend this game.
"I love the game, it's just amazing!"
What happen to the update? When i open the games.. it always says that i need to update the app.. but even i uninstall and reinstall the game.. its still the same.. need to update.. will fix this bugs.. i lose my save files bcoz of this..
I love PNG waifus.
C'mon it's fate it deserves 5*
Maganda ito sapagkat nandito ang mga karakter na aking gusto mula sa aking pinapanood na cartoon
"Amazing, just amazing, this game is one of the best mobile games I've played. :)"
So much fun EDIT: Still fun. Good story but hands down the worst gacha rates on earth
I really like the story and love how the battles work...Pls keep the good work up
I beyond love the story of the game. The arts is so amazingly top tier as well. I reccomend it very much
It so amazing
Best Japanese RPG in with the most intriguing story in android I ever played.
"Don't listen to what other people say, play it if you want it, ditch it if you don't. Plain and simple. Some people nowadays just want to ruin stuff for everyone just because they are too salty about others actually finding happiness in games they genuinely enjoy."
Best game!!
"Can't stomach most apps and games because of them shoving ads after u beat a level or having limited time bundles thrown into ur face. F:GO is free to play with no ads, but u will WANT to give them money with how well it's structured. Good gameplay, great story (after first few singularities lol), great events. This is a Gacha game where you roll the in game currency that you save up for servants. F2P you aren't going to get every 5 star servant. Save your SQ and look ahead for the one u need"
"Immersive, a great game of a grand adventure."
"I've been a huge fan of Fate series for almost 10 years and I used to play the jp version of this game. I didn't finished it tho and switched to english ver cuz my friends were also playing this. Great gameplay as always and got 2 ssr during my first two weeks of playing. I also love the soundtrack, cast and graphics~ I just hope you'll bring back some old events :3"
"For me an excellent game and story.But there is one thing, can you make the game to link in SNS such as Facebook, Twiiter, or Google Play so that when they accidentally uninstall surely they can sign in to the account where it is linked that was left. That's my suggestion, Thank You."
Abysmal rates. Story is good but the abysmal rates makes this game lean towards people spending real money to enjoy it. Don't tell me to just grind sq bcos you know that's bs. You can grind sq but that isn't enough.
UMU!
It us fun
Just give me a castoria okay?
"I was holding off on it for a long while, but now im obsessed."
"Great story, great game."
"The best part about this game is the story and the character, literally everything else is just bad and/or outdated. Definitely recommend if you hate yourself"
I got three 5* artifacts before i got even one 4* servant...
Using a Noble Phantasm makes the game freeze.
The way entire events become unfinishable with one missed day is ridiculous.
Great game I love everything about it but we need an event archive so that we can get older f2p servants instead of possibly never getting them. Also we need a speed up in content so we can not be so far behind jp. Because being two years behind is ridiculous. Even dokkan battle is only 6 months behind jp. But if you fix those issues this would be probably the greatest game on Google playstore
It's so sad that this game is not available in my country but somehow I managed to download this game. The gameplay is pretty fun although is quite repetitive and bland and the gacha rate is a little bit annoying. As a f2p player It's unfortunate that I didn't get np5 for the certain characters I wanted even though I've saved my sq for them. Well looking at brighter side this game is still enjoyable even without spending money on it though you need to be patient.
"My game got lost transfering it to a new phone. Contacted them by e mail. Never got a response, which is troubling. Loved the game and been playing it over 3 years so you can imagine how far I got. The time and money spent I definitely can't start over now."
Love the game only thing that I wish that could change is that after completing a quest you get 2sq instead of 1 and reduce how much ce you get when you summon I sometimes get 3 units and the rest are old ce love to see that update then I'll go back to 5 stars
"This game is merciless in the gacha. It is Free to Play friendly to a point (protip: do NOT hinge your enjoyment on obtaining a specific character because the odds are overwhelmingly against you), the gameplay is interesting and fun but quite grindy like most mobile RPGs. The story is good but takes a long time to get to the point where the writing is anything noteworthy (it can also get very confusing). EDIT: Dropping to 4* due to recent, unacceptably long delays between story chapters."
"The app keeps crashing. I tried clear the cache, updating the app, and clearing my memory. Nothing works."
Lmao nice
"I love this game but there's a lil bit of downside. Imagine being F2PP grinding and grinding for years, saving up all those quartz, resisting to pull on other banners just for your waifu... but you find out rate up is a lie and spend 1k quartz without getting a single 5‚òÜ. All those hard work for depression..."
PLEASE GIVE US GOOGLE SIGN IN AND BIND
THIS GAME IS HOLY NUTZ COOL PLS TRY IT
jeanne alter carries the game
Really addicting but grindy if you play for free still at least you can play for free.
Got saber astolfo He's hot
Very good graphics with some interesting dialog and character design
Long standing game more than enough content
"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS JUST A MOBILE GAME! At first impressions, the gameplay seems simple and bland but as you proceed deeper into the story, you'll be MOVED beyond other games that you've played. Once you've reached the SIXTH SINGULARITY that's where the story and gameplay difficulty SPIKES UP as you dive deeper to reach the truth and conclusion of the Grand Order. Really recommend, you'll fell in love with the characters, story, illustrations, OST, interludes, and the challenges itself."
I hate it
"The game is getting better more than ever since I started playing a year and 5 months ago. I'm a huge fan of history so I got to play this game. I got hyped whenever the story goes to its climax, especially on the main quest. The gacha is not a problem for me anymore. Thank you very much, game developers and publishers for making and giving to us this wonderful masterpiece, and I hope that you will continue your service around the globe."
I really like this game but can you change the effect of skills of the Knight of the round table in En just like jp
"Fun game, but crashes in almost every fight on a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra."
It's very beautiful game but sometimes it's lagging with my phone
Wish it had the English voice actors as an option. The drop rates could be better. but the way they handle events is the best I've ever seen.
This game is so much fun
This game is the prime example of a sunk cost fallacy.
Best strategic game poggerssssss
"The game is very fun and i understand that there is probably nothing that's gonna change with how the gacha system is but looking past that the game is truly beautiful in both gameplay and story, i've been playing for a few months now and looking how the jp version is, this game will most definitely not keep you feeling bored Edit: In the future they will add a pity system but it's years from now for global to catch up to jp"
Love the game. Make me know about the story
its an amazing game and i just wanna say good job on making this Game
Was able to receive help from the staff and quickly recovered my account.
"Imo it is one of the most expensive gacha games out on the market. In order to get the one unit you want, youll need to farm for at least half a year to get a decent chance at rolling. That isnt too bad, if you dont have many favorite units, but there are many good meta units that it would be a waste of time to pass up on in the long run. The gameplay isnt that great or fun but it can be challanging. The lore and the story is carried by its franchise which is its only saving grace."
V√¥ m√£i ko v√†o ƒë√°nh event ƒëc
I like this game bc of astolfo
1k7 saintquarts no space istar ???? 5 star when get her !!
i got 5 ereshkigals from 1 11 draw lol
Armpit over meta
Waifu collection simulator
i love fate women
This game is really flipping fun! Too bad about the amount of data it uses.
wish it was cross-platform
"Amazing game, characters and the story is really great. I really love the game and I'm having lots of fun, besides the gacha.."
Been playing for 3 years... I'm exhausted.
Can I play it because it's I just don't care for the game
Salt.
"Fun game, a bit grindy, but a good way to pass the time"
"Unless you're rolling in cash, you'll never be able to get a servant you want in this game. Add on to the fact that pick rates for high level or high star cards are so unfathomably low, it's completely unfair."
"gacha hell, if you want to pend 300$ and not get a 5*, led alone the one in the banner and get a trash one this is the game for you. dont play it"
10/10 would suffer again
This game is such a cash grab. You need to spend at least 200 dollars to get the new unit. The events are pretty lackluster and it is just not worth spending money anymore.
"Fan of the series but the gacha element is horrible. Did 4 ten pulls but not even 1 4 star or above servant just craft essence.Do note can the game can be cleared with the free servants but let us be honest, we want certain servants."
One of the best gacha games to date. Highly recommended.
Start asap as there will be welfare servants form events n stuff
PLEASE UPDATE!! ITS SO ADDICTING !!
"Game's been fantastic lately! More side quest events. Main story is a hot mess. And less grinding, some events are super grind fests. I really loved that Amazon event where I got to use my whole collection - more of that please!"
i. like. it.
"The characters themselves are well done and the story is interesting, but the drop rates could be better but it's a gacha game they want you to play to win."
"lost my wallet and my time for anime King Arthur, worth it"
Great game in every aspect but gaining Saint quartz. It takes days to get enough to summon with if you don't buy it. Definitely a 5 star game if this is fixed.
"Poor drop rates,no pity, outdated game"
This game is amazing to play
"Average Gacha game. Nothing special about it. If you like gacha games and the fate franchise, you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, it is a bit of a time waster"
The dudes in this game are fantastic. I love my bros
"Pretty fun, even when u spend no money u still tend to get some cool servants."
"For a long time I've ignored this game until recently my friend forced me to try it. I have no regrets. The story is intriguing, the characters are interesting, the illustrations and visuals are cool, and the battle mechanics are not boring. I can't give suggestions since i dont have much experience, but for now i can recommend this game. In an unrelated note, i hope to get my first ssr servant."
love this game
"Gacha rate is abyssal, gameplay is nothing special, music is not bad, but why do I rate this as 5* ? If anything this game is carried heavily by its storyline, characters are very interesting and their dynamic are well written. Not to say that this game doesn't have plot hole, but even so there are a lot epic moments or feels that you can't help but root for them"
Don't make me explain what fate is. It would take Absolutely Forever and my Dog needs me.
Fate is mid
Its story is great but there needs to be more fun gameplay
Please the droprate
"Very nice, glad i got onto lb1"
addictive and enjoyable
"Incredible story once you get to Camelot, great characters, dogwater gameplay and systems."
Good but don't install it üëç
Love everything in it except the gacha. Gacha sucks.
Great game it has a good story and good combat mechanics although I feel it would be a bit better if it was a little more merciful to the player base in terms of summoning. Also most of the bosses have some gimmick where they have damage resistance that feels forced like they ran out of ideas it was fun when it first started but now it has lost its charm and just gets repetitive.

It's fun and challenging to play as you grow your servants
Everything is good except for the fact that this app can't be connected in Google play games or Facebook. It's quite a hassle specially when recovering your account.
"Boring Storyline, Doesn't make you really engage into it, it just sucks -Good graphics -Mostly p2w -No Account Saving system Overall just get a better and more engaging storyline and get a account saving system, it's not that hard almost every game has it."
traHs :/
"I've been playing for years now. It's a really fun game especially if you're a fan of the Fate franchise. Yes the SSR rates are abysmal, but the F2p servants are really strong and will carry you the whole game. Plus the story is really great, with appearances from existing fate characters."
"It's good, but please more saint quartz and high drop rate please oh please lasagne."
"Easily the best gacha I have ever played. Stars don't matter for most content, strategy does and the story is beautiful."
Loved this game
A Maze Zing
"Good game, hope lasengle put more male servants ( ‚ïπ‚ñΩ‚ïπ )"
"No pity. Needlessly slow story. When it's good, it's good. But it does drag"
Never have I thought that I would be coming back here.
Can I get a bit of assistance I've tried everything but for some reason you're game won't let me connect to the server
Give me more quartz.
"Rate up is a lie HAHAHAHA just kidding, in this game you have a power to get your waifu/hasbandos using a SQ that they give every log in (some are from events). Overall i really love this game."
"Love this game Edit:Loading is so slow Edit:I can't find my friends servants,I keep refreshing,but it won't show them help pls.... I lost my account pls help"
i like both the fate series and the game so far i havent encountered bugs definitely rating this 5
Cancer
"Great game, but sometimes feel weird on my gacha result"
Amazing strategy game
"Waste of time, boring gameplay, even if you get characters you like what's the point?"
Other than the crashing thenits fine
It's fun for passing the time
I already have 10 SSRs in less than 400 days. Still waiting for more sqs for more chance in gacha!
This game is so good I have no words to describe how good it is
pog
This game is really awesome
Unlimted Waifus Works
So many waifus
Poggers it keeps me alive lol

"Been playing for years, nice pass-time."
"This game is so very good, good mechanics, good writing, ect. But relies on hard gambling for everything in the game, encouraging really expensive rolls at a very very low chance at the higher level stuff that will very likely end in a lot of dupes of the same useless drop. I love it but the gambling takes a huge bite out of the quality, too big for any of its actual qualities to shine through. I wish I could say better of the game, but I can't"
Gacha is awful
latest update crashes. highly disappointed
Good gacha
"Nero best Waifu, I NEED NERO BRIDE FOR COMPLETE NERO SERVANT ;<"
I love this game but theres only one problem.....I lost my progress of having an ascended berserker and having good servants and now it's all gone you mind fixing that and giving me free 5 star servants as an apology
Game good
It's an amazing game of an amazing anime series ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
why can't i open this?
This game is very fun to play and has almost every single Fate Servant. The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't have a feature that allows you to compare the stats between 2 of your servants at the same time
Very addictive
"FGO is, despite its age, still a very good gacha game. It's story is easily one of its most engaging aspects along with the very enjoyable and diverse cast of characters based on historical myths and legends. However, it really does show its age as one of the earliest gacha games. No auto-farming, punishing players who don't log in by resetting the bonuses and an atrocious pity system leaves much to improve upon."
Updated the game and lost all of my progress.
It's still is my favorite game
"Despite the difficulty in getting high rarity units, I was pleasantly surprised to know you can get through the game without needing them Getting a 5* mf is still very helpful and more likely than I imagined"
"The game is great. The art direction, plot, and ability to complete content with free characters or how while some characters are better, it's not impossible to use who you want. The only gripes I have are rates. It is rare to get a 5 star character. If you truly want one. It is wise to save and use the information we have from the Japanese version(further ahead by two years) to prepare."
Just give me Ereshkigal and ill rate it 5 stars
"This game in my opinion is probably the best gacha game on the market to me, and I feel what allows this game to do that is through its characters. In this game you can clear through almost all of the content without spending a single unit of the in game currency(more difficult but can be done) which makes it feel more like a choice to summon a character versus actually being forced to summon Characters to beat the game. This game also has some of the best storyline and art I have seen."
Love fate. Shame there's so much pedo bait in jt.
waifu
Gacha game fun!!
Phenomenal
"Everything but the gacha is 5*. But not only is the gacha outdated and awful, but the company is toxic towards its players too. They insult us for wanting a pity system, saying things like that we're greedy."
Awesome game and cool graphics pretty much have fun experience
"One of the best gacha games out right now. The gacha sucks, but there's no other gacha that has a more fleshed out universe and characters. (Don't bother reading the story pre-Camelot though) I've been playing for 5 years and I can say with confidence that there's almost 0 power creep. Every unit is relevant. This game focuses more on skills than stats so you better grind those lottos or you won't have the 151 mil you need to lvl up your 5* waifu."
Downloaded it when it came out. Still fun to play!!
Game is fun. Just very greedy with their quartz. Also sucks that there's no pity system.
This is the game that last almost a year to me Its my favorite now üòÇ
"I just watched the whole animated series because of this game. Now, I'm a FGO fan... Nice game!"
Best gacha I haver ever played.
Game is eh Played this since 2017 nothing good changed in terms of gameplay except the breakbars concept. Community is filled with people that think they look cool because of their constant ssrs but they are just really inconsiderate of players who haven't been lucky since the game has no supporting system that eases the lives of F2Ps. Tfw the developers prioritized the delete account option rather updating the account bind system showing that a lot of players are quitting LMFAO
"It's Gacha nonsense so unless you love the series and are willing to spend money for A CHANCE to get good characters (seriously BS) don't bother. If you enjoy the series, like collecting characters, or have no end of money to waste by all means play it's a great game, outside of the gacha (which the devs joke about like it's okay SERIOUSLY BS FEATURE), I enjoy it."
It gud.
This is one of the best game! You can say the game is good base at the good lore not based on gameplay. Good Story means Good Game. *Reedited my Review since 2017
quartz
"I've only been playing again for about 1.5 months and I'm enjoying the game. Well, I did quit last year Summer event but it was because it couldn't run on my phone and I didn't have time to use my pc often. The story is very engaging. Even though the gacha rates are low for SSRs, the game gives you good 1-3 star servants and the welfare 4* servants are some of the best in what they do, even compared to 5* ones. It has a lot of depth to the strategy and it's fun trying to come up with one."
ƒê·ªß waifu
"It's good game. but You can make login or bind account with E-mail, phone number, Line, FB. Because It so hard to redeem account. if this account get dissappear."
"I love the game the salt is there like with any gacha, but I enjoy the fate franchise so it's all worth it."
"After all these years playing since launch, FGO really ended being one of the few games that did steadily improve over time. The game continues to present an interesting story and the writing generally maintains a good quality level for fans. Of all the mobile games I've played, including Genshin, I still prefer FGO over the rest."
"Good fate series game, many servants to choose from and you have many ways to get free saint quartz in game"
fun game sucks my life out
It's pretty good but quarts ain't to ez to get and I can barley summon
Amazing game. The NA branch has really stepped up their efforts. 11 out of 10.
Manifesting Castoria & Muramasa üôèüôèüôè
the lack of marriage mechanic ruins the game
Cool game based on anime of the same name; though it could be the other way around. Either way it's fun to play tons of fun to play many of the characters of the many series and movies
"Could be better, translation has a few too many odd rewrites, content has a lot of gaps, nothing much in the way of feedback is available for fans. For now I'll watch over it and see if it tries to improve."
This game has ruined my life. But nursery rhyme is the best daughter so I guess I'm stuck.
very nice game especially for a fate fan like me
"Deletes your progress after it stops working and wants you to reinstall. Then to get your account theres an absurd japanese form to fill out, and all answers must be in japanese, last battle, time characters etc. Crazy this is allowed."
Why I can't update ?
"Great game, story is beyond awesome! The drop rates seem a bit predatory I've hear it's like 1% to get a five star servant, good luck ever pulling and event servant. Good thing is you can get well into late game if not complete the story if you just beef up your 4 star and 3 star characters which they are vary generous with and. You get some pretty strong 3 stars by just playing the story. Game play can be a bit repetitive, but the story is so worth it."
A very nice game
Feels good man...

"Hi everyone, I'm having a problem with the game. I can log in the game, doing summon, etc. But the moment I enter a battle the game freeze. I can't play it no matter what I do. I tried clear cache and I even tried to uninstall and reinstall. It didn't do anything. Help!!!"
hellish fun?
"Game is great, storyline is very interesting, the characters are amazing but the gacha rates are so low. I can't even get a character above 4 stars. This game may be a little not too f2p friendly. If your rich and willing to spend then go ahead and spend it on this game. For the poorer people, like me, I will continue to struggle getting a 7 star until possibly 100+ more gachas or more"
all the grind was not worth it pls put a pity system
Racist drop rates
Its Fineüëç

I be looking for more then just bussy
the game is good but there is a problem I spent 80$ to get SSR servants and then the gacha give all five star card and I didn't get any 5 star servants all they give is 5 star card and 3 star servants and a little 4 star servants like 7 of them all is 5 star card nothing is 5 star servants

Amazing game 10/10
Please give me okita
It a good game
I LOVE GACHA GAMES
"Your gotcha system sucks, game is overall fun but when you trying to pull characters/servants, getting 10 essences and 1 servant is bogus, separate your pull system if I wanna pull essences everytime make a separate summon system for that."
"Fun gatcha game always being updated with new events, characters and animations in PvE"
Really like the game but had to uninstall it for a minute and lost my saved data but I contacted the developer and after answering some questions they were able to send me a transfer code and I was able to get my saved data back. And I would also like to thank the developer for there help on this.
why not 1 star
Worst Draw rate of any game. There are over 200+ characters and over 200+ CE cards. There should be no reason to draw the same card back to back then another type back to back in one 10 summon. So if you want a game your planning on getting slapped during summons then this game is for you. Just watch youtubers spending hundreds of dollars and getting ripped of on there summons should be enough to turn most off.
The game is good
Gacha is complete trash but exceptional story telling and lore.
"Got Artoria, all I wanted"
Plz fix the connection error
I really enjoy the game. Keep up hr good worküòç
"The story is 8/10 since it is hard to understand if you haven't watched fate anime. The animation is 10/10 since the animation is cool and it doesn't crash even when the internet is slow. The gameplay is 10/10 since you won't get stuck at certain levels since it is actually beatable, you just need to borrow other player's servant and of course you also need strategies. The summon system is 10/10 for me since I managed to get my first 5 star servant with summon tickets and the second with 90 SQ."
"I've played this game since NA release. As a fan of the Fate series I love this game also it's my main game. Waifus game, grinding, turns system, NO auto farming, nice story, gacha hell (as every gacha game) but very enjoyable. The only thing I want the devs to improve in the game is the translation, like, seriously... it needs more love at least with the unit names. Fan-made translations of units and story are way better than the official one by far in terms of fidelity with the JP server."
I cant update to the newest version for some reason
Yopi
Don't play this. You'll get depressed
Don't mind my comments im just whaling
I like gacha
"I don't understand why people keep saying the gameplay is boring/outdated, but I personally love it (The main reason to play this game)"
Pretty good so far
Thank you for making this game!
Gacha is bad civilization. I end up skipping the story half the time (at least during events) just to continue the grind... If the lines were voiced it might be better but they're not....and combine that with the most brutal drop rates around and I'm pretty much stuck playing this because of the sunk cost...
Goof
"Out of all the gacha games i've played so far, This game might be the most addictive one yet. I love it."
the story is great the game play is good you can play it F2P no problem but FFS FIX YOUR EVENT CE RATE UP!!!
Verify addicting
"I like the game. It's rather grindy, but entirely possible to have fun and receive decent drops, without putting a single cent into the Gatcha side of this genre of game. 4/5 good casual Fate game with excellent character art."
I was enjoying the game but then I accidentally lost my account. ); I know this is my fault but can my account be restored please
ITS AWKWARD... the posistion of the game is very awkward... uninstalled.
I played this game for 2 years
My guilty pleasure game. Love the lore of all characters and the story.
Absolutly love this game 10/10 would gacha again
"The update button is not showing up, please fix ):"
Tohsaka is best girl next to mordredüò©ü•µüòà
I love this game it is vary fun
"The card system takes some getting used to, but once you've figured it out, the game really opens up in terms of depth and complexity"
Gacha!
"It is very cool game, I've been playing for 6 years now"
"I love the fate universe and this one of those game that I'll never get rid of on my phone. It's that fun, It's good for me to pass the time with when I'm at work."
"This game is really good, this game hand holds you for the first few singularities but then there is a steep learning curve, one that is easy to grab after a bit. With so many characters to use in your roster (albeit it is through gacha) there are many ways to fight through the singularities of time. Not to mention the game receives frequent updates for events that will keep you busy for a long time. 10/10 experience. P.S Tig anime biddies go brrrr"
"Been playing this game for almost two years and it's one I continuously come back to. The story is top notch, graphics are amazing and the cast of servants out right now have interesting takes on their respective figures. The gacha system is terrible of course but it's par the course on these type of games. Overall, I love this game and I hope they don't ever discontinue this one! -edit for Feb 1, 2022- Still going strong with this game!"
Great humor and drama in their events and main story. Not for everyone. Especially the one who do not like Light Novel games.
Really fun to play
gacha hell
I'm addicted
The game is grind happy but it's kind of fun I think. I think that the rates could be better but the story is really exciting and engaging and it requires a little bit of thought which I don't like Although I do wish there was an autofunction just for the days that you may not have enough time.
Rate up is a lie.
"No pity system and No monthly subscription to gather quartz. This is why this game is left behind. Plus the acc is bind through transfer code, not even e-mail or Facebook bind. You better do something about it or you'll definitely lose more players."
"I love this game been moving at a steady pace sense starting. One thing I would like to see is more modern servants like mad jack churchill, or charles hazlitt upham. That would be really cool"
Rate up is still a lie :}
"Nice game. Needs some translation errors fixed ( ""Altria"" )"
"Your standard gacha game. The lore and community make it worth it though, especially if you're a fan of the other Fate works or Nasuverse in general. Even if you don't know anything about the setting (like me), it provides enough detail to get invested. Just hang on for the first 4 singularities and it gets a lot better. Don't expect any miracles from the gacha rates though."
"Very fun bit grindy love the story, extremely fun if you like fate."

"Update: Took a year off, back once again. Still love the game, excited for all the new stuff"
"Since the 2 lastest updates, I can't play the game anymore, as there is no ""UPDATE"" button in the play store to get the latest game version, please fix."
Yorokobe shounen
GACHA!
Despite quite lackluster gameplay and odd choices for characters rhebstory and characters themselves are really what keep me playing this game
"Low star units really make a difference, some even hits harder than SSRs if used correctly"
"Despite having loved playing Fate GO for nearly 2 years, the glacial pace of story content release and utter worthlessness of the gatcha system, I'm definitely considering deleting this game."
"The final boss of gacha games, when's the concept of a pity system coming ? Edit: in two years as of 2022 Jan apparently."
"The story is better than most AAA games, absolutely phenomenal writing. I don't usually play games on mobile but this game is just so good to skip out. I'm talking about the story and the game overall not the gacha. I'm salty when it comes to gacha too but that doesn't make this game bad. 10/10 will play again."
"Great game I'd say, more so if you're a Fate fan. Gacha rates can be heartbreaking but the story and events kinda make up for it."
Absolutely love it been a fan of the anime for so long
"Game is super fun, especially if you follow the lore of the natsu lverse. Gacha isn't to bad at time but remember, it is luck based!!"
I really like the stories
"Horrible Rates, Dying Game"
"Reasons for 3 star: Good story, low gacha rates and no auto"
"The only Gacha game that I look forward to playing, for better or worse. Simple yet fun, gacha is either on your side or heavily against you. Give it a shot if you want and if you stay, have fun üòÄ"
Simple gameplay but phenomenal story
"Alright, by now I've put far too many hours into this game to not give it five stars."
TRahs game made beart a cihld for my npo give renies or prooetaa And I I nEED me Three D jiggly Big ENohmoyrs tittes
After update to Android 12 game started to crash a lot and support refused to help! As a long time player and have been putting a lot of money on this game it really pisses me off
Good game good character and good story.. although the game is lacking auto farm which makes it really time consuming especially the dailies. And the top ups don't have any packs but overall its a enjoyable game and every servant are useful even low tier
All-time favorite Type-Moon game
I recommend this to everyone
"Great story and characters. The start is slow, and only starts to get good at ""Chapter 6"", but it's worth it. Must play if you're into the fate franchise. Game is very generous with the premium currency (SQ), but the downside is there is no pity system (there technically is but you'd have to be a whale to make us of it). Gameplay is fairly outdated. The game lacks support for more ""modern"" features such as wide aspect ratios and higher frame rates (locked at 30fps)."
1 problem when i open it will only be stuck at a blackscreen but i can see touch effect
"Hell yeah, spent alot money on dis game and still worth it to play in 2022"
Don't waste your time here game play / visuals are very poorly done and the UI feels tedious.
Don't add pity system
Not available in Latinamerica/region blocked.
"The game itself is pretty fun, though not fun enough for the gameplay to carry it alone. If you're not invested in the story to a relatively large degree at the 2nd singularity, you should probly drop it now instead of later. The reason I give it a 3 instead of something higher is because of how utterly hostile the gacha system is. The rate at which the gacha token item is acquired combined with the incredibly low rates for higher class servants means you shouldn't come for the gacha."
Don't like it that much
I have a really fun time coming up with team comps for each battle
"Been playing for 2 months, God I love this game and the entire franchise. Customer support is nice and cooperative. I'm just F2P game enjoyer, gacha wise tho you need a ridiculous amount of luck otherwise you'll be having SALT AND KIREI'S BLACK KEYS for dinner. There is no pity system, even if you spend hundreds or even thousands of SQ the possibility of not getting any 5* is huge. Anyways, I have a couple of 3* NP5 servants and, and I manage to reach Lostbelt 3. Good Job on making it playable."
Was decent
So good I got it on pc tho
Addicted to the waifu gacha.
This is hell I'm walking into
Decent pve only gacha game art work is great. Although no auto battle or google/Facebook login support recovering your account with ease hurts this game.
I'm not Ganna lie this game is really good and the skill effect of the each servant is nice but the problem is the saving your progress in the game after I save my account and reinstall the game my account Is gone I'm so disappointed all my hard work is gone Like nothing happen
I've been enjoying the game so far but there's the sudden freezes where the game freezes for like 4 minutes unfreezes and then a couple minutes later it freezes again for another 4 minutes. I'm only giving it three stars until the freezing is fixed

"It's fun and I still enjoy it, but after a certain portion of the story is complete I started to realize there's really only a few strategies needed to beat most Lvl 90+ battles. And since the story and game art/animation is really what still interesting, I usually just hoard ressources and wait until a complete story arc is released or when a new desired servant is added to the game."
crashed 5 times trying to get through the tutorial.
"I love the game, but can you change the mechanics on data transfer, I just lost my game account since i can only do it once, please change it."
It doesn't work with latest update.
"The story and character design are what makes me play the game, the gameplay is okay but can be much better."
Game sucks
"I absolutely love this game! Of all the games I have tried this is by far the best. You can spend money but you don't need to. I love the Fate series, which lead me to this game. I love the storylines and animation. Artwork in motion!"
Aniplex very cool of you
"R.I.P. Fate 2004-2015 Best story and universe I ever read, has transformed to generic mobile gacha trash."
"Nice i like This Game.. it's Smooth, Good Graphics & story idk How will i discribe Anymore"
Its so cool and so amazing and its really what im expecting in the game good work and the voice of the characters are perfect and i love it so i give 5 stars for thisüòäüëå

"Indulge yourself in a story designed from the ground up to be accessible for the illiterate from the acclaimed minds of a writer who can only work one idea, and artist who can only work one face. Enjoy financial distress from rolling for artwork ranging from slightly clothed busty children to slightly clothed, busty men. All of who are historically accurate. Lose yourself in a story about taking back your future via exposition dumps and gimmick bosses. Delight in its quality above other gacha in the same way you delight in learning that you have lice and not crabs. Go on to write a stellar review and browse forums of likeminded individuals to justify the fact that you've wasted a sizeable chunk of your time and money reading the same story told multiple times and eagerly wait for more."
They have a pity. All is good.

"Good story, good animation, good gameplay, good customer service. But my god did the grinding take time. I've got no better supports than Andersen and not everytime a lvl90 First Hassan's gonna make it on the last 3 singularities. But still, the hardest gacha system and my addiction to world history is enough to make me stay. Tip: when you're done in London, start farming and leveling up atleast 1 of every servant types and a support."

Like the anime so gave it a try. Fun but you don't get nothing for draws you basically have to pay to get top tier characters
"By far my favorite game i have on my phone and watching the anime makes me fall in love for the game even more, love the NP and the amount of servents there are"
"After the recent update the game kept on crashing, I'vr tried uninstalling and reinstalling it still crashes idk what to do."
"The story is good, the characters are also cool. Perfect game to play when you need to take a break from some work."
this game is good if your a fan of history and anime this game is for you but if your going download this game save your saint quartz
I love this game! (And the waifus üòâ)
"Excelent game i just download this game yesterday and ilove the game play and story line also the va,"
It's a gacha game that requires brain. Really well made story and quality game play.
gameplay is a bit confusing in the begining but once you get the hang of it and the characters its quite fun
Is cool
"even if you are a fate fan, only play this as a joke. Hassle to play, and only good for whales and people with too much time on their hands"
Touch some grass FGO player's
1% rates for 5 stars. I'm not usually one to complain about rates. Ever. But really?
Gacha rate is a lie
It's a gacha game...I've had 3 separate profiles and my current profile has seen more 5*s in the month that i restarted than my previous profile that I had for an entire year(no 5*s only 4*s)
Good game good story and good characters
"A lifestyle change, I have adapted my lifestyle to fit this game. My rating from 2019 stands clear."
"Babylonia best story, best characters"
I like the storyline of the game but it would be more fun than we could choose from a variety of characters to start off instead of just the shield girl
This could be a pretty decent game if it didn't have a bunch of child pornography.
"Easily able to enter top tier, gacha is not pay to win, game in general is not pay to win. All characters are generally good and if not, they get buffed or you can build a team around them."
"you'll be doing a lot of grinding throughout the game, manually, since there's no auto mode. gameplay requires some thought but you can just friend a whale and blast through most of the beginning sections. play it for the characters/IP, as well as the story (it gets better from Camelot onwards, apart from some of the pseudo singularities) edit: as of 2022 a pity system has been implemented in JP servers for the new years event, guarenteed at 900 in game currency. ETA for NA probably 2024"
Lots of grinding to max out servants but the game is humourous and quirky in a good way. I've always liked turn based games so I may be a bit biased but the balancing is good for the common characters and the 4/5 star characters feel powerful enough that you jump for joy when you get a new one. The game throws enough premium currency at you so long as you log in every day so the better characters are relatively easy to get. So long as your rng is good. 9/10 not bad.
Awful gacha. Any game where having a whatever star character matters so much more than the gear and doesn't separate those items in draws is garbage. I've done 3 10 draws now and have not gotten a single character how can I progress without anyone of significant strength. Whatever idiot said these draws are fair should go sit outside and think about it real hard.
I've played this game since the day it came out and have spent hundreds of dollars on anime PNGs. I hate this game. 10/10 hard recommend.
I would love to get into this game but I hate the camera with a passion. The violent movement of the combat camera makes my head hurt. I would much prefer a stationary camera than the camera present in this game.
"I've put a tons of hours into the game and I can say with out a doubt that the game is great, it has some issuses like no pitty but if you can get around bad gacha luck, the game is amazing, between characters and the great writing theres not too much too hate, unless you dont like grinding tons of hours."
"If you're both a Type-Moon fan and especially a History fan, then this game is perfect for you. Ever since I watched Fate from 2006 adapt up to latest I've been a huge fan of Fate and for being a nerd on History just makes it so good. Gameplay-wise is great, although it might make you bored since it's a repetitive turn-based the amount of unique Noble Phantasms and combinations that you can get is insane. Highly recommended to play both story-wise and gameplay and good luck on your endeavours."
I really a big fan of fate i wish you creait a moba game i really love it you meck one pleaseüò≥ and really love sebar if you thinking oh sebar its althria pendragonüòçüòç or king Arthur pendragonü§î and i loved mashüòó and this tame i watching fate/extra last encore if you see dis please say : üò¨you stupid manggrul that's gilgamesh for youüòßüòÅ
really fun game great for when you're bored and really like grinding games out a lot hours of content and all kinds of stuff to do in it highly recommend
5 stars if I got less mapo tofu and black keys...
the fake amazon website gave me a virus
>Gacha
Run while you can.
Nice game besides the fact that i spent 80 dollars on summer4 banner and only got carmila(not even her summer version)is depressing
Great game with a fantastic story but has an atrocious lack of account backup options. No SNS back up at all.
"After playing for quite a while, the game has lost much of its appeal. If it wasn't for the characters I've accumulated, I'd probably stop playing the game altogether. I choose carefully the events I actually participate in. A lot of the time, the events can be a tedious grind, and I take a pass. I'll keep playing, but only because I have played for so long. Definitely not exciting anymore. Seems like the developers are are just not putting in the effort to make the game FUN."
Don't get me wrong; it's a great gameüëå BUT WHY IS IT GLITCHING FOR ME WITH JUST ONE LEVEL. I've been stuck on it for almost a 3 months now and it hasn't let me progress through anything!
I hate GACHA!
Super fun. Always skip cut scene but the battle mechanics are stellar for a mobile game. This is my number 2 when I run out of stuff to do in Guardian Tales
Made a new account and gotta say the game is pretty good with all the updates and events
I just think Meltryllis is hot yo
This game is Awesome it have my favorite characters in the fate series and I love the different servants you can get. One of the best games you can get and would play as many times as I can. Thank you so much for releasing it.
It's a good game I just wish you could gain exp for your servants from battles as well as ember farming
I only play for the Waifus.
So much fun I have always been a fan of the fate series oh!! Plz add tiamat as a summon plzzzzz ^^
I love this Game and Hated it at the same Time Because Rate Up is a Lie...............
"Absolutely wonderful game. You can tell in the beginning they werent expecting it to get so big, so the campaign is rather plain. But if you stick with it long enough, it turns into a compelling story. The last 2 singularities are worth every second of your time. The gameplay might feel a bit dated due to it's simplicity, but it's solid and FAIR. And i never felt like i needed to spend money or grind in the game. Overall, this is the best mobile game on the market. I cannot recommend it enough."
I want to be altria's husband
Didn't get ishar n yang guifeng üòë
"It's a decent game. I am easily attracted to anime card games, and this one does it well. Been playing for years, on and off but I kept coming back for it. And it does gets better with the updates now. Oh, and please understand this, it's a gacha game. You will often, won't get the ones you want. But there's a workaround in the units roster. If you can be content with that, you'll definitely enjoy this game."
"Need to free up 700 mb, update only 34-36 mb... FGO logic"
Love it.
Simple to Play. A bit boring at the beginning of story. Chapter 4 - South America is where it starts good for me. Very good casual-past time and challenge quest is literal no joke. You need to whack your brains for team comp or RNGesus sh*ts on you. And above all I just love it Artoria Pendragon
"The ultimate gacha experience. Don't even have to be a whale to get your favourite characters, got by just fine f2p. Honestly it's worth 5 stars just for Gilgamesh's laugh."
"Gameplay is ok, story is pretty good, the gacha is terrible."
"Love the game, but I really wish I can link an account."
Good game but not for everyone
"One of the BEST mobile games I have ever played. If your a fan of Fate, you'll definitely enjoy this game."
"Deleted my review TWICE! lmao Pathetic! Anyway! Playing this game only taught me one thing, no matter how hard you work, youll always come up short. Unless you plug in a debit card and whale, that is. Japanese developers are no longer worth our respect, as theyve willingly thrown themselves headlong unto the same chasm as EA, Bungie and Bethesda. Shall we go for a 4th time, Aniplex??"
Love the game but recently the game crashes ever so often sin last couple of patches
"I downloaded fgo, I tried played it, but it didn't work properly, because due to connection issues, please fix, i beg of you please!!!! Fix it and update!!!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
"Starting to experience crashing on my s21u to the point where I can't even progress in any battle, I'm not sure whether it's due to a recent software update for my phone or if it's the game itself."
"Cock and Ball Torture Section 7: Fate/Grand Order Come play, the gacha rates are generous and the convenient auto battle feature means you will never waste countless hours of your life grinding to upgrade your favourite .png of a genderbent historical figure."
Astolfo best boy/girl/them/whatever he's the best. Love the fate series and this is one of the better anime mobile games to play
Super fun gatcha game
good story and gameplay downside no pity system
"I'm only giving this a 3 star rating because if you delete the app or something happens, regardless of the information you give them, if you don't remember the name you had for your profile, everything you worked hard for will be gone in an instant,"
cock
"Been playing this game for almost three years now and I wish there was a servant trading system even though it wouldn't be realistic to the lore of Fate, but I just wish there were a bit more ways of acquiring much wanted servants."
F2P FRIENDLY PITY SISTEM
I played this several years ago but lost my account due to the single save code being a thing along with a patch that prevented me from opening the app on my laptop (where my save was). That laptop broke a couple months later. Several thousand dollars spent in gacha all lost. 2-star rating because I remember the game was fun for the several months that it lasted. Posting this review as a reminder for me to never pick this game back up again... and to be smarter with my money.
Edit:I have see reviews and you don't respond to any of them it would be nice if an arena was added and if the gacha was balanced the best I got from 20 draws was three 3star servents fix this and learn to respond back and I will give you a 4 star at best
"Resource farming being 40ap is one of the dumbest things I've seen on here. Cause you'll get done with 3 or 4 and by then you'll have to wait or spend apples. In which you need to save btw. On top of that n.a again, 2 years behind jp there is no need for that. Charecters are somewhat difficult to get to where you pray rng is on your side and if not well, there goes months worth of farming saints quarts. One thing that needs to be said demon king nobunaga desperately needs a buff crit wise"
I love the game's story and events but I hate it's gacha
F*** you and i'll see you tomorrow
"Does not respect players' time, one of the worst gacha to date, it only maintains players through its connection to the popular cult series."
Jeanne is in it
I like this game
It sucks u get 200 craft essences for ever servant no matter the rank of the servant and u never get any of those the games a rip off
"""Gatcha is a bad civilization"""
Love the game and anime
Games is really fun to play! It doesnt getting 4 to 5 star heroes is indeed hard but even having 1 to 3 stars are very useful! Great story and events. Love the silly parts as well they make me laugh so much. Good work guys!
great game.
Very amazing
Cant play for long periods of time but very solid game.
If it had a pity system for 5 star characters this would be great
Game is good specially the story line only concern improvement in gacha rates is needed.
This game is a cash grab how you gonna have a Gacha game with no reroll options.
Da vinky lit
Tho it is hard to het 5 star characters aka (1.40%) rate on average but u dont really need them and 4 star character are so cool as i am a FTP player

It's 2022 give us more box space you made how much....it should be like 10000 servants and craft essence
The gacha maybe merciless but the story is lit.
"The story is well written and works like an actual visual novel, the mechanics and gameplays are amazing, although the only downside is the gacha, it's hard to get sq to summon the servant you want, you need to be really lucky or really rich to get what character you really want."
Give me a 5 star
"I love this game, reminds me of my real life. My luck can't just find the love of my life just like summoning in this game which makes me more depressed. 5/5 rating. God Bless the RNG for other people"
"It gave me Arjuna Alter, I need to keep Delightworks happy so I get Castoria."
"Good game, F2P friendly and very nice community"
"If you like game turn base, anime girls, and history figures. Then this game is for you"
Good story and nice animation
Boring.
I hate how much time I spend.
"This seems to be a turn-based strategy game. Based off the anime Fate series, you can collect characters from the show and experience the game's unique story by progressing through chapters that are regarded as Singularities. I've been playing this for an entire year. By progressing through the Singularities, participating in the Chaldea Gate, and completing Weekly Missions, I end up with a good amount of Saint Quartz (items used for getting new characters). Today, this is my #1 played game."
All I want is Castoria
Not very cool pay to win
I HATE IT!
"I love the game, i love the series, im not a fan of gacha games but this is beyond just a gacha, stories are very interesting, rewards are very exquisite, but pulls are very bloody as hell, although the gacha sucks, the storyline is what ive came for. Im a huge fan of the series, and now im a huge fan of this game."
... I can't access my account ... I'll just play genshin
I hate the game its the worst whrn i try to play my game and ad of this sh! Game comes out why does it exist
"The only flaw in this game is that it can't connect with facebook or gmails that will surely make your account much safer than it was before because when I was a beginner I forgot to put transfer code twice that the last time I can't log in Because I lacked info on my first account. but I have an another account.(so its ok or not but it was 10months ago,nah its fine) P.S. It needs update where you can link or bind your account into another gmail or either facebook etc etc.."
"Bizarre fun, equally bizarre.story, best for fantasy and mythology fans."
"Everytime NP is about to be used, the game lagged. There is nothing playing in the background and I have a large storage space yet it lagged. Please fix this."
Great game I love the the fate franchise and the story really does the characters justice. And yeah you might not get the servant you want but that gives you more motivation to keep going. All in all 10/10 game.
"Lost my account, and the Support team has been the worse Support team I've ever had the displeasure of contacting."
Nice and good graphics
"For the past 4 years of playing. It has improved in gameplay, visual, and story. Know that it can be better to it customers by implementing the pity system sooner then later, and more easier for non-whales to get the characters by having it stay constantly to the next banner."
I really like the story and gameplay but especially in holiday giveaways you have to pay to get them
If you're a masochist who likes to get fvxked in the gacha while saving for that one servant that you really like and aniplex decided to do the pro gamer move. This game is for you
nice üòçüòç
gimme gil
"A fun game for fate fans, only issue is the drop rate is abysmal especially if you want a specific 5 star character. To really enjoy this game with little to no out of pocket you will need to accept whatever character you get, friend other players with really good characters and finally grind for xp and upgradematerials. The combat is surprisingly deep similar to Madoka Side story cellphone game, sadly madoka looked way better and had a better soundtrack."
Pity system yes
this game gave me gambling addiction
1 lb = 1 star
"Usual occasional money grubbiness aside, the game, characters, story, and community have engaged me enough to keep an account active on both the JP and US servers for over 4-5 years each. The main stories seem to get better and better."
Been playing for 1 and a half years. Gacha rate sucks but gameplay is good.
Hmmm Bad and good at the same time... Yes
"The story is kinda weak from the beginning until you reach the 6th Stage of the game. The gameplay is really creative and is fairly balanced. You can even clear the game without any rare servants. The art is just breath-taking with the character designs, though I can't say the same for the earlier characters that came out."

Absolute trash game. Don't even waste your time if you expect to get a 5 star servant
I like the original version
300 sq no Yang guifei trash game
"Story is neat, art is good, gameplay is minimal and the gachas are ridiculously high priced and I just got 3 of the same low value character in 1 pull which is just insanity. Would not recommend to others."
"Played this game for years and I love FGO gameplay, story and characters. The game is worth playing for along time."
Love this game and the team behind it. Had trouble at first in transferring to a new phone but the customer support was patient and understanding of my issue.
Where's my Mordred animation update? 1 rebellious knight /10 would simp for mordred again
"So far I like the game :) the character design, the gameplay, and the free quartz. Kinda hard to pull a 5star character, but it's still a good game and worth to try :) Hopefully I can get any Jeanne, Saber, and Ishtar character 'cause they're my favorite hehe"
I've been following all the series of the universe of fate series- from the original eroge up to the tons of animes and spin-offs they created. I'm so glad I'm still playing this and I decided to give a 5 star as this game deserves. Gacha games are pain in the azz for a free to play player like me but I'm more absorbed by the story content so I didn't mind the gacha rates that much. Please keep the game alive for all years to come! Keep safe devs!
"Absolutely terrible translation. There is simply no point in playing a game that is ""translated"" as barely readable fanfiction at best"
Very addicting
Ready your wallets if you want a 5 star character
every thing is pay to win you want a character that was relevant to the series you need paid crystals. It takes a while to grind for normal crystals but you need to pay there are like 2 summons out of like 10 that are free. If the devs eased up on the i want money perspective they would earn more players. It not like i can spend money on the game its just not worth it. Like its microtransactions of the charts drop rates are so bad like straight up horrendus.
I was gonna try it 'cause I heard it was a godly gacha game. But I can't even play it 'cause I can't connect to the server properly. Uninstalled right away.
Yea gacha ruined me

I love this game and franchise.. but I've been saving saints quarts for a very long time as I have multiple times and everytime I summon ANYTHING I get the same 3-4 star summons and cards I'll never use.. you say the drop rate is up on things but it's not true when I spend 60 saints quarts and get literally nothing of value.. I want to continue supporting this game but I feel very let down and sad that I got nothing out if saving up for so long.. please refund me my saint quarts or something.
"Stay clear from this game. I played it and there's NO guaranteed 5* unit, what's worst is that the x11 summon only guarantee 1 4* or higher and its mixed with level up materials that are 4 times more likely to pop up. Yeah you have to summon to raise units and the gem grind seems long and tedious its NOT a friendly game if u r f2p, very pay to win"
Give 30 SQ every 10 Days :)
Fun at first but got boring for me quickly.
Downloaded it! A great game to be honest. Only thing is that It lags sometimes. Still a great game though.
Super
"Definitely the only gacha game I've played and continue coming back to over the months. Although getting 5 stars is up to luck, it is possible. I've been playing for almost a year now (with breaks) and I've gotten Nine 5 stars and twenty 4 stars. Keep in mind though I'm not 100% free to play as I've spent around $30 max for Saint Quarts- mostly for the guarantee 5 star banners."
"I just downloaded it to experience the game and found myself having a lot more fun than I would initially thought. The story I've already came to know through the manga and anime but the gameplay is what got me hooked. 8/10 rating from me. Because it's around 8Gb, not that easy to recommend to a friend based on storage size, and the fact that craft essence is on the same banner as the servant's banner is annoying. Have craft essence and servant banners be separate."
Pretty Good
Good game hmm...Kaso potang ina pag-dating sa gacha napakasobrang sama tang ina
"The Game itself is Undereated considering the Graphics, Mechanics, and Logical Thinking involved with the gameplay, Although i only get 4-5 stars with 1% Chance (Based on My Luck not the Chance Rates) I love the Game basically, Quite the refreshing game to play. Anyhow, If i can give a Suggestion, Why not make a Trading System in-game to trade Ascension Materials for Other Ascension Materials."
"Excellent game, with good story and surprisingly deep gameplay. It's literal hell, don't play it."
Great game dude
"A great game if you enjoy the fate series, this is a gacha game that gives you pretty high amounts of rewards at the beginning of playing. It gives you daily rewards spanning over 14 days. The rates of characters are fairly good I would say and the quality of the game is quite good as well, it is definitely a game I would suggest to a friend or two."
"ahhhhhh i became addicted to this, its just so gooood, ive been. playing this game for just two months now, its just keep getting better and better. I've also decided to play the game first before watching the anime of fate grand order. Thank you type moon, üéÑMerry ChristmasüéÑ"

"The Nightingale event was practically predatory. It doesn't block you, it let's you find out the hard way that you haven't gotten far enough in the game to actually win the character. So I struggled with the event only to be blocked last minute."
"A fun game if you enjoy the Fate series. Pretty unfair with saint quartz though; players starting after the initial lauch are basically screwed, with no more free quartz, and having to play through an entire chapter for their first, very small chance at a 5* servant. Basically, this game is for huge Fate fans, or whales."
"I guess it really got going been a a fan fate for a while and when I saw this and gave it a try, I enjoyed more than I thought I would. The story and gameplay is good though some character animation update should arrive more quickly. The farming can repitive and the gacha system is just too much though I got really lucky when I started and some of it happened from time to time. I just my account fixed due to data transfer error log out and props to the customer service for resolving the issue."
"After playing other mobile games, this one is pretty meh by comparison. A bit too bare on what it has to offer, (like no daily missions, skip tickets, auto play, etc.) Which was fine when this game first started, but there should be no reason why this game is lacking those big changes years later. Only redeeming quality is the story being good, but even then, that can only help so much. And the drop rates are bad in comparison to other mobile games."
The game keeps freezing on crashing for no reason
"It is really disappointing that I put in all this work for Santa Nightingale I don't get her. All because I haven't completed the last singularity. I would not have mind if I was just blocked from the event, but this is just devious. Blocking my prize just before. I would have never finished the game I have work & other things to do. I enjoyed playing it as a random relaxing thing. It is masochistic and foolish I was going to spend cash for quartz so I could try to get there sabre Astolfo. üëéüëé"
"Frankly this whole game is hard carried by its IP. It absolutely does not deserve its current rating. Yes, the characters and story are great but outside of that, the gameplay is just decent, it's business model is notoriously predatory, and it's quality of life is outdated and archaic. The only other good thing I can say is that very few servents are completely useless. Most of them are viable to use, even if only in slightly niche roles."
"Well, what can you expect from going to gacha hell. I have been playing for a year and a half and this hell is comfy af."
"The story is the main attraction, and it does not dissapoint. However, the gameplay and gacha aspect are certainly... dull? My biggest peeve, however, is that the game does not run on a cloud-based data system. So if you were to lose your account, it's basically good as gone! I just lost a 3-year old account due to that, and I am definitely a bit miffed. However, support was fast and got it back really quickly."
"my Acer Cromebook os cannot play this game and i need keyboard usage in rpg games like arrow keys to move around spacebar for talking and picking up stuff, fighting, and the ESC key to get into menu for game"
good. I still dont have Astolfo.
Personally this is gonna be a very epic game to play even in the Coming 2022

"The only thing stopping this game being perfect is the rates of 5 stars but thats nothing new really, enjoying the game thus far"
"Game continually freezes in the middle of cutscenes forcing a skip of the cutscene. While I'm not running the best phone on the market, it sort of takes away the immersion since I have to skip all cutscenes. Game runs fine the rest of the time."
Best game.
I've spent a worrying amount of money on this game.
Love the characters.... Wish i could get my favorite boi Astolfo doh
I really enjoyed this game and it keeps all the stories you've read from past events
I have no words about the game really love it and story is so much fun Thanks you
It is Great!
"This game ruined my life and changed my preference to femboys(astolfo) over ladies!! I love this game! Just kidding, great game with a storyline worthy of the king of kings."

"This game is Good, and I'm saying this cause I love Astolfo (Please let me draw him). But still gacha sucks ngl or its just my RNG that sucks."
"I mean you can enjoy the game for free, but it's gacha so be careful."
I want to cry because wamen don't love me and I think im Gey
"Great game and a great story. Although, there are a few gamebreaking bugs that'll force you to you uninstall and reinstall so always keep that code on standby."
"Loading issues, game is aight, if it loads, but that's the main issue sometimes And no, the connection is fine. If I can browse the net, this should load but sometimes it just does not"
Add pity please
trash 2d game
"This game is trapped in the distant past. No auto for farming, no pity rates, choppy login bonuses. Playing FGO is like stepping back in time and not in a fun, nostalgia sort of way. Every time I come back to play after convincing myself it wasn't as bad as I remember I am immediately reminded why I left. It is a game that refuses to keep up with its competitors in terms of gameplay, the story is its only strong point and even that is getting tired. Move on to any one of its better competitors."

Is good but have problem with game freezing
"Ever since the global release of FGO I had been on it daily, spent time grinding, ascending and all the quartz I could acquire. Spent money for quartz to gacha but had really bad luck. Suffice to say I was a good whale for my time spent. Story and events are great, plenty of content spent there for many content updates. Spent being the keyword here. After forgetting to make a transfer number after I reinstall I now have no way back to my account. Spent all my time and effort and it's gone."
"Account lost after a year break, support couldn't get it back. So here a rage rating."
"Dont bother, the story is exposition on exposition on exposition at a snails pace, the gameplay gets your bored after 3 fights with no way to auto and the gacha rates are abysmal with no pity. Even the ui looks 10 years old with visible pixels and blur on modern phones."

"It's not bad. Animations and Story are good. However, the game looks and feels ancient. The interfaces, menus, gacha/servent system, ... is all old and clunky. They should invest in a remastered re-release or a Grand Order 2 where you could import one of your servents."
The gacha roller-coaster
okita told me to give a 5 star
Its just another cash grab mobile game that has an unskippable tutorial that forces you to click through everything they want. If mobile game devs would just let us play the game how we want from the start I wouldnt have an issue with all the pay to win garbage.

It's heavily pay to play any garbage person that defends this game is obviously dumb enough to pay money on it and it has the shittyest rates out of all summon rate games
It is a fun game with a strong. I am just on burn out because Auto/Sweep doesn't exist.
"Best phone game I've ever played. As long as this game keeps going, I'll keep playing."
"Great game, really fun to play, and it has awesome graphics"
"Great game overall with Phenomenal story, great characters and combat. My only issue would be drop rates at times and the fact that after a while, getting quartz can be a pain unless you open up your wallet. If rates or quart acquisition was a bit better it would be a 5* without a doubt."
It is EPIC!
"I love this game, started playing cause of the anime but slowly got addicted to how amazing the storyline and battles are in this game."
1300 quartz for one non rate up 5 star :)
This the best game for me :)
Good but thier should be a pity system for free to play players
"I've been playing since launch. Game is immensely fun and has plenty of hours of replayability to get all the materials you need. Can't really rate higher than 4 because it is a gacha game. Rates are obscenely low for 5* units and are too high for Craft Essences. Leveling some things is also completely absurd and takes way too long. Despite all that the game has beautiful character designs, fun battles, a solid story plus very amusing events."
"Load times are better, doesn't interrupt audio anymore"
FGO COMEBACK PLEASE MORE SQ
"It's Frickin awesome you should download it asap. the servants are pretty cool, and it has a good story line."
"It's a good game. Extremely dated. Quality of life stuff comes at a snails pace. Only recently got full screen. The grind is a nightmare unless you have reliable wave clears during lotto events which are kinda rare. The gacha is rancid too. Easily top 3. Which is coming from someone who luck sacked 6 kscopes in less than 2 months. This year. Avoid gacha. It's a death trap. The story is ultra compelling tho. You can tell their entire budget went into story, art and VA and nothing else."
"I really love this game but there is an issue, when i open the game it says the game didn't launch properly and i have to redownload it. I don't want to uninstall it so i will be waiting for a bit to see if it works. I'm almost tearing up and i would cry if my progress was lost. I really want this issue to be fixed. Update: im changing my rating from 3 to 4. The issue is fixed, but there are many updates. It took a really long time to download the update aswell, but i still rlly like this game."

Needs a pity system
JUST GOT SALTERRR WOOOO LESSS GOOOO! (shawt awt kay JM‚Ä¶)
"Best waifu simulator, but gacha is so bad. I'd rather play azur lane."
Great but a NP skip would be nice. That day will never come.
Great. Fgo is my source of happiness and sadness. It's been 4 years and I still playing this game.
"Very good, slot of fun, be wary of spending money on it. It's a slippery slope."
I got a 5star after 1 pull. üëç
If you like gachas where you grind a lot. It's good
I wish the chance to get a 5‚òÜ was a bit higher it's really hard to get one
"This game and the whole franchise deserves to be among the classics of fantasy franchise. No matter what others say about its outdated game style as a game, the lore and story is just one of a kind that you would still continue play it indefinitely. I wish that even after a century or more this game won't be ever be forgotten. Nasuverse supremacy! Thank you very much for giving us this game developers and publishers!"
Love it. Still 5 stars
"This is a gacha game, so be careful about going into it. Anyway the main story is just fixing abnormalities in the timeline. There are tons of servants (characters) that you get to play as such as, Jack the Ripper, Leonardo Da Vinci, Astolfo, Achilles, and Jean D'Arc. It will probably be very confusing at first, but just bear with it as it does get a lot better. The game is still being supported with new events."
"This game ruined budgeting for me, i love it."
"This game made me interested with history and mythologies. Subjects I have always dreaded studying for. The best part is that it requires minimal interaction with others to play. Frankly, FGO is the only game I have been addicted and continued to played for over a year. Hoping for more content!"
Only modern gacha game without a safety net. Fight gimmicks get dumb in the later modern parts of the game that require specific setups that go into rocket science level study to pull off and the gacha pool gets more and more polluted with every update. This game is incredibly predatory to anyone with a gambling problem and frankly isn't friendly to the wallet even to low spenders. Decent story but otherwise avoid.
I want a auto battle feature
"Best, even though I didn't get my target servants, I'm glad I got SSR spooks"
A fun experience... want an arknight crossover
Love the game :3
I Like Emiya
Really bad gacha rates with no pity system and awful storytelling with a bland self insert protagonist. It's 2021 and this game still doesn't have cloud save for some reason.
"I encouter some problems with this game, the animation of np is quite terrible, it glitches or lag something, and i cannot get any the 5 start servants even i purchase SQ...... i always get craft esscence. Thanks for the disapointments"
"Gacha hell, :)"
Love the game ^^

Its keeps saying that i lost connection when i try to open the game.
"The story telling is incredible, it has serious moments and silly moments. As for the game play, it's about strategy. You don't need 4 and 5 star's to move forward, planning is the key to moving forward during late game. 1,2, and 3 stars can still do wonders. As for the Gacha part, it's all about luck. It took me 2 years to get one Quetzalcoatl yet took me only a few days to get two Kingprotea. People who claim rate up is a lie are just bitter because they didn't get what they wanted."
"The best gacha game ever, ever. Top tier writing and character design. Worthy of the illustrious anime to which it is related. Great rewards and gifts. Awesome, frequent, and satisfying events. Keeps improving steadily. Staff listens to fans input. Prestigious and original - many other games just try to be FGO. Genshin is garbage compared to this; it's from China, and based on exactly nothing so the characters and writing aren't even compelling. If you play Genshin stop and play this instead."
Pretty decent overall save for the ocassional animation freeze and long load times. Wished farming certain ascension material wasn't so tedious maybe add the ability to buy or trade certain material.
"Love the story, characters,events,etc though the gacga can be a pain"
Transfer code system is dated and stupid. I lost it and I'm literally waiting days for a reply just to get my account back.
Hey this is hell your walking into
Yes But i cant get my s star
I love this game. Great story and art design
"This game I absolutely love. The art, the effects, the story, the music, and the events, they're all very well made. I've been left in aw. I've laughed or cracked a smile. I've grit my teeth in determination against foes. Ive played for a long time and love it. Not to mention the feeling when your favorite servant is finally summoned against all odds. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of fate."
I love the game but the summoning rate can get rough.
It was very enjoyable
I hate so much
"I hate this game, but I can't physically live without it"
"i love the game. lost my old account so im starting again, however, i cant log in. it just keeps saying i cant connect to the server. i really want to keep on playing so i hope this gets fixed."
Terrible rates with terrible grinding for quartz.
"I WILL GRIND UNTIL I GET ASTOLFO, I DO NOT CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES, I WILL GRIND FOR THEM (Yes, reader, Astolfo is non-binary)"
GOOD GAME :)
"Kinda been glitchy lately, also its almost impossible to get astolfo and it makes me sad"
"After downloading the app, the game doesn't working. I re-downloading again. The game is same problem."
Failed to connect to game server even with 5G data connection
"Such a nice game. The lore, story, gameplay is just so good. It's grindy and hard, it makes you strategize and pick which servants you're gonna use which is what I like the most."
Notch still doesnt adjust on Android 12. Maybe just me
The game has a nice story and fun characters. Grails are a nice thing bc they are kinda meant for characters that you like not for just a gameplay stand point. Events are fun an a good source of materials. The only thing that's bad is account recovery.
Before I reach camelot the game loading is smooth as butter but it just become worst when I started playing camelot I want to farm stuff but loading takes up almost 40-50 secs sometimes it defeats my joy of grinding when I have nothing to do
My wallet hates this but Jalter is life. Story is pretty good
Awesome graphics and story.
Screw your rates
Awesome I'm enjoing the game ‚ù§Ô∏è
Good lore
dont play this game lol
EX- luck yes
Apparently still have not fixed the frozen in battle issue yet this is the third time reinstall the game and it still freezing up if not compatible with Android phones needs to be either fixed or say not compatible
"Updated review I have been playing fate Grand order for several years now, I can honestly say I'm feeling left out of a certain group meaning the j.p. server because it feels like Global is being left behind in the dust with nothing to do no events only new servants and I'm kind of getting tired of it already and lot of my friends have already quit"
2000 SQ still no merlin
"Gameplay is great and though it can be a bit on the griding on the game and very low rate for a ssr summons it very irreverent to the story which in my own opinion is top tier however there a problem with new 11 summons part that was included for some reasons when I try it,it only gave 10 instead of the 11 and worst of of all it only works on my single summons,tried uninstalling and it still there I don't know others are experiencing this but what can you do remedy this problem"
Only game I ever played that smacks f2p players right in the face lol never once have I pulled a good unit....like no joke....and the speed it takes to collect gems to summon is just ridiculous
Beautiful waifus ehem I mean best waifus I've ever seen and all about this game is great
"gacha bad,game good"
"Game itself is kinda fun but it's aging like milk, and the rates are pretty abysmal."
The Darksouls of the Gachas sorry for the spoilers but you will never get a SSR so easy Welcome to the Gacha HELLüíÄ
Please fix the auto scrolling problem. Will change the rating then.
"I really like the concept of it, It just that it takes so long to load and that's the only problem I can think of"
"Gacha experience is better than most I've experienced and there's more than meets the eye in general with this game. Come for the ""plot"", stay for the actual plot. Thats more or less my experience."
Good game honestly. Been playing for about 2-3 years now but this past couple updates have been messing up my game. When on launch game runs fine for a while then all of a sudden it starts studdering and freezing in mid mission. I restarted my devices and issue still persists. Now im experiencing the game crashing along with the other issues. Never once experienced this before. Hopefully issue gets patched because it is irritating constantly having to close the game and restart.
Honestly would enjoy it more if there wasn't a battle in every single story node with mobs stacked to the brim with hp. Also gacha rates are garbage for those who somehow never heard FGO's infamy. On the bright side they make good use of all the whale money with animes and stuff.
i wish I could at least get a 3 star summon let alone a four or five star summon instead of getting literally nothing but essence...there goes 1500 quartz..very disappointing....
Game loofn. N√¥n SO ra ƒë√¢y

Pls gib me pity
"Best phone game, best anime game, best girls lets go."
"Pros: Good story, great characters, fun gameplay... Cons: Gacha rates downright hellish, No pity system like for real why?, Events are super grindy for newer players, Might leave you with a super bad gambling addiction. You can definitely clear this with F2P servants but you play this game to get your wanted characters though, right..? Conclusion: Decent game with a little bit of cash grabbing salt if you're addicted to this and might leave you with mental problems... (last part is a joke)"
I always come back i cant escape
You want to empty your wallet? You got the right application üëç
"I've been playing for almost a year now and I just lost my account due to my own error, tha game was fun and I had a blast playing but not haveing any means to recover your account except for a single use transfer code sucks, so be careful, cause if you're not you might waste money and effort."
"The main story picks up during Camelot/Babylonia, and the game does offer several events through out the year. Most of the art is good, some of the in game models are dated. Gameplay is decent, and can have depth. The gacha rolls are terrible and can feel worst if you are a f2p player. But most of the f2p 1* - 3* characters are useful throughout the whole game. Plus you can get fully upgraded welfare 4* characters during events. Because of this I think FGO can be more fair over other gachas."
The game needs a new to save game data. I lost a year wreath of data.
"Waifu collecting simulator, worth every second I put into this."

"Played this game for two years then decided to take a break, tried to go back after a few months away and its all gone.... help"
"I enjoy this, though I'm pretty casual and recently started within a few months time, I keep noticing how random days happen where I open it up and it just black screens but shows the little magic to indicate that I touched the screen. The only time it seems to fix is either at random or just uninstall and reinstall. Minimal hassle as I just keep using the codes I get to get my account back but it's a bit exhausting sometimes. Overall though, I like this game alot."
"It's definitely one of my favorite gacha game. I do agree that 5 stars summoning rate is low, but some 4 stars are better than 5 stars. The starting servants are great, especially Hercules and Emiya. But because of the overpowered support servents, most fights at the beginning felt disappointing."
Well I give a 5 Star since it's my first time playing this game yet I already have 8 SSR
Love it. I got Mordred. Tenkyu.
"As a long time player, I love everything about the story, lore, and characters. However, the low 4 and 5 star rates with a lack of pity is the glaring problem and has always been. The absence of an auto mode is also dissatisfactory."
This is one of the most immersive rpg games i have played. There are a wide variety of summons from all parts of history. Its a legitimate FTP.
"I love this game, I have been playing it for over 3 years now. Until recently I've had no major problems, however the last few days the game has been crashing quite frequently and it's getting rather annoying."
Too addicting damn it I deleted it four times and again download it to play if you are just a casual player like me then don't get addicted to gacha system and don't use money to buy saint quartz it's not worth it besides it game is great and the story is just amazing
I love this game and the shows
Reason? GERDA!!!
Why do you guys having issue downloading game data with sky cable can you please fix the issue asap.
Not vararr Good
"This english server sucks guys , download the japanese version much better they giving so much blaze and when you finish the fuyuki you can summon a 5star servant, uninstall ur english ver, download the japanse ver . . . . . . . . ."
"Good story, bad everything else"
You know I don't really like too many gotcha games (And my bank account hates them) but this one just has a special place in my phone.
"Dear developer, give me gacha bless"
"Gacha luck isn't all that great, although it's just about being lucky. I'd definitely recommend someone this game."
salt gacha morale drops
I want Astolfo
Only because it appears on youtube app. Cheers
I'm sad and salty
"I love the customer support, good game, 5/5"
Waifu/femboy=very cool
After my phone updated again it seems the crashing problem was resolved.
Hot garbage
"Grind heavy, high end characters necessary if you want to get through the game faster"
Honestly just love the game.
Really Good story driven single player game. Gacha rates are abysmal but you can still beat the game with low star servants. only complaint is the lack of a pity system.
I play 2 days ago and got enjoy it but after I reinstalled the game today my acc is gone now and got disappointed..unlike the other games I played it's auto bind on Google play app so even I reinstalled it my acc still be there.. but on this game to much work..so I'm gonna find other game glad I didn't much spend time on this game yet but kinda depressed this game story is good...I will miss my tamamo cat
"After the Latest Update the App can mo longer connect to the Game Server and always says on the loading screen that: ""Can't connect to Server"" or sometimes ""Connection Error"" even thou I have an average-speed WiFi Internet and a 4G/5G Mobile Data, I tried to e-mail the support and yet the help they can provide me is to keep telling me to have a fast-internet connection, bruhhhhüò§üò§üò§, I already do and yet they still don't mind if I can't play or not, come on Delight Works; shouldn't you be fair?"
"This game has made me smile more times than I can count, I feel like I've made an actual connection between myself and the servants. Yes the gacha rates are horrid but in the end, find a charecter you can relate with or like and learn more about them through fgo. And the story is phenomenal, the events are amazing, there are some thst are a little repetitive but in the end JUST GIVE US GUDA GUDA 1 BACK PLEASE DW I NEED NOBU!"
5 star for help center even thou they reply late
Great game i love it. If it could go more i would rate it higher
"My phones camera is in the middle of the screen and honestly ruins the experience, I didn't mind the bars that were at the side because of this and also allowed me to actually see what's happened. The rescont update got rid of the bars, I'm not saying return them I just wish I had the option to toggle full screen or not. That's all"
"I've put so much time into this app and have many accounts. I am totally free to play at this point and if you stick with the game long enough you can have a very amazing team without paying to get more rolls for extra stuff. LOVE the Fate series, watched much of the animes though not all and I might get into buying the manga. With how much time I have invested into this though I just think 5/5 stars is obligatory."
"All I need is Kotomine Kirei, or Rasputin, or swimsuit guys. Otherwise very enjoyable."
Im addicted tbh
"I don't think I have enjoyed playing the game in a long while. I'm still a fan on the series, but I just can't enjoy it anymore."
The App not working since the update on November 16. It still not working. I can't connect to the server.
Can i have a code for this game?
enjoying game
"I'm dissapointed about the update in full screen in the app, just by updating it in my phone it was incompatible now and couldn't play it anymore, been playing for 2 years now. And ended just now."
"Grindy as hell. You can't simply put on auto and clear a stage. You're gonna have to bear it all, selecting the most appropriate cards in a given draw and selecting the target to optimize damage output based on all available strenghts and weaknesses. Gacha rates are also quite low but that's to be expected from an older game. Still, I find this to be quite enjoyable. The story alone could keep you glued to your phone."
Pls fix the black screen
Amazing game and story love all the characters especially astolfo sadly have not gotten him yet but aside from that I would love to see more content then again that is me.
Wew
"after the wide screen update, it became super slow on my device. I have oppo a55. The app works well until this update. edit: fixed the connecting issue, i just had to restart my router. if any of you experiencing the same problem like i did, give your router a restart or if you are running on data, reconnect it."
Version 2.23.0 don't run on my potato phone anymore... Thats sad.
"5 stars cause the game supports fullscreem on my device now lol, weird seeing like this tho"
"Super fun, great variety and good fun way to earn characters. ( I've spent way too much money on this, could buy a car with said amount )"
"Great game, but sometimes rather time intensive."
I can enter the game and enjoy the story now. This is a complete upgrade. Please keep up the wonderful work!!
Thank you for fixing the bars on the side of the screen and optimizing the display for larger devices. Great fix.
"Its a gacha game with 0,7% SSR rate. Salty af. Also, prepare for unlimited grind works."
Great Game.... It always made my day
"I've played this game in JP and had a blast. Currently now playing it for the story. People complain about low summon rates, but I personally like the fact that you can't have every servant you want. It makes the ones you do get that much special."
"Fun as Hell, great story and the events are Fun . My only complaint is gatcha system sucks though and they need to update or buff a lot of the older 3-2 star servants some of the kits are weak or just plain don't work. I also want more rerun for events that may have been missed or not able to be completed to welfare servant's"
good game because even 1 star servants can be amazing
amazing every bit!
One of the best games i have ever played And nice update the full screen was epic ‚ù§
Gacha hell. I love this game though.
Game deleted my content and started me over?
"Game is good, got 1k quartz without even spending a sent and with good gacha luck didn't even need half of it to get what I want so far. Play your cards right and you might not even have to spend a single cent. Great game, story is amazing, and a cast of characters with well written backgrounds so you want to get them even more. Only downside are maintenance times which interrupt my QP grind"
"""It's character portraits and it's art"" - Stanley, the office."
I got a 5 star twice for free :))))
"Bumped it up a star from my last one. Been playing it more since when I first downloaded it, and while it's fun, and has a lot of really cool historical and mythological characters, it's way too hard to get who you want. I really wish summons were split into 2, one for characters, and one for everything else"
This is a very fun game if your into the fate series and is worth looking into for the story. But the gacha system is horrible with near zero percent chance to get something good and getting resources is EXTREMELY limited and time consuming. I would give this game a 5 star but resources and the percentage system is audacious. To the point where you have to buy saint quartz or spend everyday logging in and spend hours finishing extra quests to only collect 10-20 saint quartz.
This game is great
Update wont install
It's been going well so far. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend looking for a gacha game with a good story.
This is the best game ever I've ever seen
amazing better then any app!!!! pls rate 5 for this!! :)
Maybe this will get me a 5 star
iza good
"So many waifus, so little money."
"Love the story, lots of great characters, and lots of cool aspects, but please for thighs sake either make it easier to obtain SQ or give us better rates üò≠üò≠üò≠"
It's fun game
Been play for over a year and totally enjoyed it
The download process is broken rn
"It's only good for story. Never summon though. Rate up is a lie. If you're somone with a gambling problem, DON'T PLAY IT. The story aside from being a save-the-world type deal is worth the 4gb of space and no price tag. Aside from that, the game is poorly optimized by gameplay and summoning standards. The game also punishes you for not logging in consecutively. So if you're someone who doesn't like high-maintinence games, don't download it. Please don't fall into the same trap I did."
Same as my luck. 3 Star lmao
"Been playing since launch, it only gets better over the years."
"The Rates Are Scummy, But I've Grown To Accept That. Gameplay is getting more interesting. I can only hope the game gets better from this point on."
App Version Error.
"Story wise, most of it is great and interesting. F2p friendly unless your waifus/husbandos are SR/SSR. Some event and story stages requires certain strategies which keeps the game fresh and challenging. Grindy but manageable, animations and graphics are getting updated which is great. Data transfer still uses code and password system which I feel isn't the best way. Been playing for 3 years and counting. Overall great game, would recommend."
"An amazing Gacha that suffers from the problem of being older than its contemporaries. Combine that with the fact that it has left newer players pretty far behind in terms of story and events, this game is in a weird spot."
"I am enjoying it so far, but some dialogue are awkward to read."
"Hey, it keeps giving me app version errors and it says it need to update but there's no update appearing pls fix this"
"Tambahin reward SQ nya dong, kalo bisa gssr 2x aja limit nya üëâüëà"
I don't know why the app is not automatically updated gets very annoying when I open up the app and it says app version error.
Lit
i missed talking to people
Great game I recommend it for the lore alone (Thank you for adding full screen support)
Awesome gacha game. The rates aren't what very high and there's no pity but on the flip side you really don't need the SSR characters to play the game. Throughout the year you'll get enough free premium currency to land 3-5 SSRs easy. The best part of this game has to be its story and narrative (note you'll need to bear the first 3 singularities until London when the story actually picks up)
People die when they are killed.
Hot bois
Gatcha Rate Is hell Item drop Is stress and But Good characters depressing But a Great story
"walked into hell willingly, yea its nice here"
The only game that will test your TRUE LUCK STATS.
"Gacha is definitely on the low side; but the thing is you can clear all the content of the game with just the F2P servants; granted it will be very difficult especially if you dont olan and strategize ahead, but definitely possible. Real strengths of this game is the story and lore. If you're a fan of Fate, you have to rry this game out at least once."
Your Trade : 3 Star Servants My Trade : 3 Star Review
i got space ishtar and skadi
i'll rate it to 5* if u give me arthur or ozy today
"Really wanted to give 5 stars but the 2 year gap between NA and JP is killing me. I am not talking about the story content and event lineup but about the QoL and animation updates, those should have been 1:1 between JP and the rest of the servers. Aside from that I really love this game, now to convince Nasu/Type-Moon that saber is Artoria and not Altria. ( Also where is summer Medusa? )"
Good gacha starting new account and actually got arthur and skadi üëç
It coo
Game is bad
Bro im giving this one star because you guys need to implant a skip tutorial for people who have already played
i delete the game and forget the to make a new code lmao
A grand game i might say so myself
Good Game
i am the boner of the boning swords
100% pay to win
This game is good
GOOD
Rate up is too small
"Need more higher chance on rate up ssr, i have a 3 streak of rate off, i don't have any sq left, and I'm pissed"
"Its hard for a new player to start its to overwhelming and farming is slow NP Skip pls, but if you can pass the start the story is very good."
Arthur did not come home
The game is good to be honest although the gacha rate for 4 or 5 star character are lower. You dont really need to use 4 or 5 star character to complete game stages.
Game is good but the banners are trash
"I loved this game. It's plot and graphics are awesome. However, I would like to recommend to add more events where we can get more rewards"
Keeps saying I have connection issues dispite it working fine in everything else
Rather fun for my review as of now
FGO Fan
Game easy lost account. I lost 2 once and i not want play more.
I went to use my transfer number and it didn't work. All of my hard work ruined. My name there was garou.
Poggers waifu
Waifu is life
Can't connect to game server
"I have tried to enjoy this game but with the recent events and needing to clear the entire story to do a majority of them, the extremely low drop rates that make you spend 2-300$ at the least to get the character you want, the fact there is no auto battle to make it even slightly tolerable I dont know how I could even if I tried."
"The game has good stories and game styles. But summoning servants is hard, the material for summoning servants is limited to the game and sometimes you can't even get a single SR."
1* because of gacha rate
"Pretty good, love the game, a must play! (EDIT) I lost all of my DATA"
"I'm locked out of my game. I had to uninstall the game to save storage on my tablet and I wanted it on my phone. I put in the transfer code, but it saying the transferred game is being used on my tablet. I wll gladly give a higher rating if I can get some help."
Summon rates could be less punishing
Love the Game itself but I don't like I can't play it with all my progress on two devices I like to be able to play on both my phone and laptop and I can't
"No auto farming. No skipping NP & Servant(s) death animations. No pity rate in gacha. Even certain non limited character(s) in the gacha are locked behind story progression. Certain materials and events locked behind story progression wall as well. Extremely grindy and tedious to get materials to ascend, and level characters' skills. (Need to regularly participate in events and progress story to farm free quests for material drops). Not recommended for mostly casual and F2P players."
"Not for the weak soul, one of the worst gacha game out there covered by the fact it's a legendary franchise, if you really want to waste real big money for some dumb PNG, go right ahead Other than that, it has great story, the rest is outdated, boring, and grindy af"
"game hay, rate up cao, quay ph√°t ra ngay"
"Great game, best for relax"
"As a player who also play japanese sever, this game's gacha system is one of the worst you can find in mobile game market. The stories and events are great, it is a shame they let this boring gameplay ruined it. As a heavy whaling player, I still got fustrated often when summoning. So, I wouldn't recommend any new player to play. And if you really want to read the fantastic stories of FGO, go on youtube and read it there."
"Well it's very addictive and the storyline is noicee. Be warned cuz it has really bad summoning rates but the lower rarity charas actually help when starting out (just a tip). Well hey, when u have E luck, u'll get used to it. I for one don't feel so salty anymore hehe :)) Edit: Heyy I finally got some 5*s after a long while yayyy"
Tons of content is freely available but the best experiences require supreme luck or money during summon pulls. The optimal strategies you can implement in the game will require certain characters that you'll most likely not have. Events happen every few weeks which keeps things fresh. The game's base plot can be boring but there's certain campaigns (singularities) which are a lot more compelling than the initial stages. Overall great game for long term investment. Expensive if not f2p
"Very well-written story and interesting characters well worth the price of GACHA. Do not forget to regularly use the ""Clear Cache"" button on the title screen, or the game's data will swell to overtake your phone's entire storage from unused update files as Events are released and locked away."
The game didn't install the update please fix the update patch I don't want to lose my space isthar that with lvl 2 panthasm
All my previouse data is gone spent thousands on it this game is not siutable for long term play
Lost my account and they couldn't help get it back don't spend money on this game
good one
üñï
The worst.
Good..
Fateeeee
Give me luck pls.
I love this game I've only been playing for abt 2 weeks and i already have most of my favourite characters. And I also got a SSR/5 star servant. With only 2 weeks I already got a SSR/5 star servant which is Hijikata toshizo the vice chief of shinsengumi (weird seeing him like this since ik his character from gintama) this is overall an amazing game and highly recommend it.
It's Good
A game aimed for fans of the Fate series. I like the art in this game it's not always consistent but all the characters are unique in thier own way. The story starts slow at first but ramps up til the end with an epic climax in the Final Singularity and gets better in the 2nd Lost Belt Arc. All characters except welfares have 4 portrait arts and 3 battle sprites which is also a nice touch. A must play for players who enjoy story and lore in RPGs.

Okay ill have to change my review. After restarting after some time playing for idk how long now. I realized that through how long term this game has been. It hasn't been updating itself to be more player friendly. Gacha rates are sort of worse. Similar to other games where there is more other stuff than units...where the rates to get the units is worse. If you are f2p...ignore this game. Don't try it. And avoid it. Ill save you the trouble and ask that u play other games.
Great Game üéÆ !!!
"Im a fate fan , so im biased :)"
"Great game, huge fate fan. Perfect for fans of the franchise"
"This is an awesome game for fans to play with their favorite servants, great game highly recommend. That being said, i can now no longer keep my consecutive logins, have had to delete some of my other games because these updates are so often and so big i am out of room once again. So now it has been 3 days since i could play because another update, out of room again."
Was able to retrieve account
"""rate up is a lie"" - 2019 it is still a lie but in 2021"
I was very impressed by the amount of time I put into the game my only disagreements are the lack of space it has I had to remove it for having more space than my phone could handle also grinding saint quartz is painfulll #FirstHassanIsBest
"Very good game for any Fate fan,but expensive if you want to spend money on it. 5/5‚òÜ"
Nvm is good
Low rates / less new and interesting characters just malking the same characters to make you spend more
"Good but i kinda need the gacha pity system, but it's a good game."
"The story and gameplay is entertaining and enjoyable. The characters are well written. As a fan of the Fate series I recommend this game. But the gacha rates are abysmal there are so many craft essences and characters in the pool that your chances of pulling a high level character is near nonexistent and also the rate up is a lie, so if you plan on starting a collection of fate characters turn around and run because you're more likely to get the same 15 characters over and over again."
"I really love the game and its story, but lately I had been unable to play because the game would go dark, but not shut off, is there anything I can do?"
I somehow have had better luck on the JP server in less than 2 weeks than i have in almost 2 years on EN.
Needs a pity system very badly
"Very good storyline,good combat system,i only wish for an auto combat function where the cards are chosen by themselves,other than that,it's a superb game."
Very fun game. Love the historical references!
"The game is indulging. The story is well made, game mechanics are simple to use, the strategic parts of the game make it at times a challenge to complete certain missions or levels. Character designs are great as expected, voices for characters are phenomenal, and the number of things one could do besides battling are okay. The gacha system does make it difficult to obtain good characters but in the end it's a gacha. In all, a well made game, and enticing for those familiar to fate series. 4/5."
It ruined my life.
Good soup
Eh it's aight
"This is one of my favorite games. The gacha rates aren't as bad as people make it seem, and the developers are very generous with free in game currency/characters. The story is frankly amazing. And while the gameplay isn't the peak of mechanical experience, it is a fun and entertaining game. The devs give a damn, a novelty among gacha games these days. Plus all content is doable F2P. I'd recommend it to people honestly."
"Much more grindy than i believed, log in bonuses dwindle to basically nothing after 4 weeks. Alot of the events are inaccesable to new or newer players which is mildly infuriating. It just feel like a cash grab game based of a really good show and theyre taking full advantage. Very grindy, more some than other games like this. In game purchases are also very expensive, don't get me wrong it a good game but you're going nowhere fast."
Android 10 has broken the game for almost 3 weeks now with no update in sight
Rates are low but not impossible. Story is engaging and characters are fun. Definitely at least give it a try
Can you add a feature where you can use golden apples to instantly finish a quest. I dont have the time now to grind for hours
Great story and gameplay but very bad gacha
"Been playing this game for 3 years or more, please keep making another Artoria series because that's the only thing keeping me play this game"
After the update I received update version error .I can't re update the app. I don't want to lose my save account
"Good gacha game, though it's kinda sad that na needs to wait 2 years to get new servants that's new in jp."
"Yeah the gacha rolls are bad. What did you expect? A few times a year they offer a guranteed ssr in exchange for the paid sq which is fine. Gameplay and story is very good. Art and sound is some of the best in the mobile space. If you want certain servants, wait for the banner and also save up all the saints quartz you can."
Uhm i have some i ssues it keep telling me to update the game as there is a new version but there are no update button here in playstore
Best thing created for mobiles
"Game is good, with its strong points being its characters and story. Problem with this game that will only continue to get worse is its age and the developers failure or lack of interest to adapt or update. This is a gacha game with abysmal (Even for gacha games) low rates... And absolutely NO PITY SYSTEM. Yeap. No Pity System at all. You're never guaranteed anything. Also eventually all servants skills and abilities become very repetitive..."
Its nice
"The game is good, has good story, fun characters, 5* worthy... but too many faults. Lack of more than 1 rerun for events so new fans miss out, hard pulls and low percent with no pity summon, feels like some battles are forced just to add filler. Maybe save up 600+ gems for 1 or 2 waifus or husbandos, because even for one 4 star 300 might not even be enough. It's not new player friendly, many faults, but I still would recommend giving it a try if you plan on being in it for the story only."
The game sucks
"Love the game, but Space Ishtar banner is hella'rigged"
"Good game. with a good story. The summoning system needs work. I understand that newer players need alot of the older CE's, but that it should be a different summon pool based on story progress"
The literal meaning of hell. I didn't regret a single thing playing this
Great aniversary unlike genshin
Fun YEP
"Add better account system like Facebook login or something, because I lost my account I had for 4 years and it sucks. I lost everything EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!"
Noice ! The game finally got me something I had been waiting for for a decade . Thank you for giving me invaluable emotions and memories .This game is worth your time .
Love this game but maybe abit of tweaks can help improve this game alot
"Your favorite Fate characters with a ton of story, and events all of the time. Avoid the temptation to spend money on SQ. If you must spend money there are 5 Star guaranteed summons twice a year (new years/summer). Save up your free SQ otherwise and spend on one or two banners you really want that year. If you can learn to accept your odds of a 5 Star are insanely small and you are likely to be disappointed it will be a lot less frustrating."
"Please make it easier to update in playstore, it's kinda annoying to refresh and reopen while waiting for the update button to show up."
p2w trash
E Luck üôÉ
"A bit hectic getting to know varieties of resources obtainable for upgrading your servants and a fairly harsh summoning system, Pretty difficult to get 5* servants without money. However with its Great characters, solid combat & appealing special events, it's a really fun game."
Rate up its a lie
One of my fav fames now
Didn't give me an SSR for 7 months now despite spending $500 for a banner. This game is rigged and scam.
Got most of my classes a 5star before spending money on it (missed a saber) and eventually a year later started spending money on it.... ahh yeah love the nasu verse so yeah.... just add a bloody auto battle already tho
Gameplay is kinda boring tbh and this game is seriously not forgiving about summons. It takes forever just to save up enough gems for a multi summon. Character designs and story are good but just doesn't make up for boring gameplay and awful summoning rates. If you want to get anywhere far in this game you either have to fork over your paychecks or waste hundreds of hours grinding. It's the definition of gacha hell. Not worth it
Pretty fun but i have 2 major updates.The gacha rates are terrible. And the ui looks outdated
"Progression-wise it does take a while to actually get anywhere but take it little by little and you get where you want to be eventually. My only real wish is for the Player to be customizable (SKIN TONES, hairstyle, etc.) Mystic Codes do not count). I feel like it's only fair since the Servants originate from various cultures and also have different forms. Many other mobile games have striven to be inclusive w/ their player characters and FGO has no reason not to follow suit."
"Bit dated, too many fodder characters and Essences. Lost an account with semi-decent rolls, Support NP system was not explained correctly. Enjoyable story and character designs, horrible rates... Cannot even get a guaranteed 4 Star character after 30 pulls on a single banner. Let alone a single 5 star in 300. Luckily Free to Play at least..."
Best mobile game period
"100 pulls, 1 four star lmao, games rates are abysmal even for gacha games, its laughably consumer hostile"
"Terrible game, 5 out of 5 stars"
"I enjoy this game and I am trying to get back into it. However, I lost my transfer number and hope the developers can help me recover my account because it would auck to be forced to start over from a fresh account."
"Beta phase bugs and freezing, decent gatcha rates, story feels like 'Bill and Ted's excellent RPG"".. which isn't really good or bad lol....the only reason it gets 3 stars is because of the battle system. It is really engaging and the NP moves are sweet! Needs major improvements and bug fixes badly."
"Great game, I love this so so much, HOWEVER, it lagged too long during in game, it consumes a lot of time."
I love the Fate universe. üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
Expensive but worth it
yeah cool game
"Please make more payment option such as mobile reload, online banking, official website payment gateway etc. Also don't restrict US region(either payment or download the apps). Great storyline but that's it, nothing more. Very old gameplay, gacha extremely bad, same playstyle for 6 years. DW should invest more to develop this game."
ok game i guess.
"Great game, love the Fate franchise, and a ton of characters who are likeable. It's a bit of a play 2 win model in which I spent thousands of dollars since it first released. This games serves as a reminder to me that whaling in gacha gives off an empty feeling when you look at it. I'll continue playing till this game dies, but I probably won't throw money at it like I use to."
The story is really good and challenging for the most part
love it. GIL HUSBANDO
"Man, I wanna like this game more. The writing is so good, it's just that everything else is so incredibly low effort. Reused sprites for everything, a boring soundtrack, gameplay that's as exciting as Microsoft Excel with no way to skip it. Type-Moon makes about infinity billion dollars from this game, some if that should be reinvested in it."
I just loves this game and the anime i couldn't askfor more
I would've wanted to play fgo but I can't play cause it always crash in my device
A hassle to update it tells you don't uninstall and then reinstall after doing all the things they say to try to do. I uninstalled then reinstalled and it worked. What I pain I lost a couple days off progress because this game wants to act funny
The size of app should be clear when you need 5 gig or more space saying it's 56mb is beyond ridiculous
"Great Game! ive been playing the game for 2 months as a f2p player i like the story, i know the story sucks at the beginning but it gets better at the later stories also most of the low tier servants are so useful not like other gacha games their low tier heroes only ends up as being a fodder. (gacha system sucks though but its still good) ;)"
One of the best games I have ever played quite challenging but very fun.
Really bad drop rates and updated gameplay. Don't buy it unless you're a whale because it is designed to just take your money
"Been playing for 6 mos now and still enjoying it.. I even got SSR servants as an f2p that's why I got hooked up in this game.. I also enjoy the stories, you have the option to skip it if it bores you and there's a lot of freebies esp during events and anniv.. Overall this is one of the best game here in mobile games so far."
Best game ever ! Great story and I really love the soundtracks as well. However the gacha kinda sucks. Spent 300 quartz and didnt get a 5 star :(
this is one of the best gachas ive everd played. But the fact that you can spend like 200$ and not get the unit you want hurts. You save for month's just to get one or two units you want and not get them is bad. This game badly needs a good pity system and not what it has now.
The game is good but the save system could have been better cause if you lose th e phone you will lose everything.
Its aight
"Honestly one of the only gacha games I can't stop playing, only complaint is early story is meh, the rates are too low, and this is no pity system. For the last 2 years those problems don't bother me so much and I hope to play till it goes out of service honestly."
"I love the game, but can we at least have more customization features? Like, being able to change our hair, skin tone, etc. Something minor, but would make it an the best full experience!"
Pay to win ... I wasted 500sq no five cards . Gaining sq is impossible it takes forever just for a few
Really awesome rpg!
Good but you might spend a lot of money on this! Real experience*
Rolling on the franchise name.Worn out gameplay with greedy developers who don't give 2shet for its playerbase.Not surprising their other games tanked
Worst drop rates of any game out there. If you want Fate content just go watch the shows.
the story is super interesting after singularity 5
My world is this game
nh∆∞ cc 700 quart bay dnn
It's a fun game however the gacha rates are horrible
Gacha is good as long as you don't care much about it I say.
gacha hell? gacha hell!
one of the best games i have played 10/10 experience. dont play it
Fun game i like fate and fate fan
"Although (sometimes) repetitive in combat, the story is very enjoyable to an extent. The characters have their own unique characteristics, and although there are some flaws this game has (Rate Up is a lie), I have my reasons to keep playing."
Play it üò©
Needs a rework. Shows its age. No wide screen. No piti system. Abnoxiously overpriced summons. Returned to see what has changed... nothing has changed at all.
Poor everytime i open the app after two days it stops launching properly and before any of you say anything my internet connection is fine i want this issue fixed for android Still having The same game problem either fix this or I'm uninstalling The game
Good luck get your character without paying real money!
Its alright I guess
I cant even load the game on my galaxy note 9 Edit 10/18 STILL can't play this game. It refuses to connect to the server.
0 5 star pulls with 500 Saint Quartz. Highly do not recommend since the makers will not even take out the useless trash from the gacha pulls.
"So I've been playing this game for a while. At first I was on again off again, but with updates over the past year, the game has become a lot more user friendly. While spending money is available and may give you a bit of an edge, it's not necessary. I mean, I spent around 30 dollars hoping to get a good servant and I didn't, But then a few weeks later I've got 3, 5 star servants, 2 of which were from summon tickets. So, it's not PTW. Just don't expect to get any specific servants."
Decent game not for the impatient though.
Despite the abysmal rate on the gacha. I really like the story. And playing this made me immerse in the fate franchise and I enjoye it a lot for 5 years I've played this game.
Kinda Satisfying to Watch my team Take down Monsters while i struggle to think of a strategy
It's very good except for the gacha rates. The many waifus is my favorite part of this game
"Genshin suck, won't let me sex with Eula"
Pelit
Fantastic.
My favorite mobile game
Great story and great customer support
"FGO is a fascinating game for both the story and gameplay. It teaches you the basics of the mechanics all the while leaving the rest up to you, because of this freedom in choice can be a blast. And yes this not pay to win, one thing it does is teaches you to rely on lower star servants. Lower star servants can easily be underestimated, so don't sell that Christian Hans Anderson fellow players. And the further you get the more powerful you will feel and as a gamer I admit it is a wonderful feel!"
Rate ups are still a lie
Maybe make it a little bit playable in low end phones :)
"I love Fate so yes, it's a 5 star for me"
Besides the gotcha this game is amazing and somewhat makes you more interest in history
this game is trash. it wastes your time and it gives you nothing back. unless ur a fatetard who is crazy about this game dont even think about playing this game. waste of time.
"Simple but deep gameplay and all chars are viable, other than fionn lol!"
It was great story
Very good game live hearing three story of the other singularities that happened before the anime
Suck rate up
"Biggest lore dump of the fate series, it just lacks things to do after you completed the story"
"I got Nobu, thank"
for modern standards this game is very outdated. gameplay-wise but story and characters are good though might as well take it on the next level need a massive overhaul played for 3 years was fun but I don't recommend it to new players anymore (this is not gacha salt)
This game's gacha and story make my addiction.
"I absolutely love this game. I have been playing it since when E Pluribus Unum came out and have not missed a single event. It feels amazing to be able to get your 5 star servants. I don't see myself not playing the game. Edit: as of 11/2021, still playing."
Gatcha game that's very fun and exciting the game fits my taste and the story
I like the story line a lot I didn't expect to play this game
"I'm lucky enough to get each servant slots with 5*, so 4 stars for this game (story is alright by the way) since there isn't much content to grind and play for hours."
"general good game for FGO funs. good hero art guide: artbook materials (1-9) while only on Japan (grammar simple, so easy translate). Game play: turn based side view combat (classic jrpg battle style: same as RPGMaker MV/MZ side battle system). Gacha: mostly 3‚≠ê, some times 4‚≠ê and if will extremely lucky (less 0,01% and 0,1% on events) 5‚≠ê characters. by this cause F2P not friendly: later game bosses has alot hp and dmg amount, so even with p2w players support characters, stage often failed."
thank you even thou i got very bad luck excellent story thou
"The gameplay is alright but it would've been better if it also had an auto mode just for the farming like every other gacha lol, the story is 10/10 I truly love it and about the gacha part... no words for it. Just pain and misery."
I was here to simp and simp I did
Sulit
"Great character designs, Interesting story, Pretty simple turn based gameplay, and frequent updates"
"It's fun, and can be played fine without pay to win methods. Just enjoy the characters you do have since they are all great and it's easy to get burned on gacha rolls."
"The best gacha game of all. You only have a Character and a CE (Craft Essence) and nothing more. Other gachas have a lot. (A lot) Of grinding to do with farming 3/4 types of different equipment. With this, you can enjoy more of the game, without stressing yourself with more things. Must Play."
Space.Ishtar
"Been playing for 3 years now and while I adore the story and characters almost every other aspect feels antiquated by modern gacha game standards. The grinding for mats feel incredibly tedious and the gacha is probably the worst aspect of the game, with saint quartz being WAY to limited and the summon rates being both incredibly low and without any pity system is almost embarrassing compared to other gachas"
"I have been playing this game for years. It is the only gacha game that I have been playing longer than a few weeks. The story and characters are great for a mobile game. The game play is fun. The only issue I have is that the game does rely on micro transactions. It is a free game other than that. If you can resist the call of the micro transactions I would recommend this game to any animal fans, and even non animal fans (I lost interest in anime, and still enjoy this game)"
lots of good servants. the story is also 10/10
I'm in pain rn
"It's a good game I've been playing since it's first released. I love the fate series, the art, music and story is great. Yes the rate up is so low I get migraines. I roll for waifu's by the way..."
Most trash gacha of all time but good story.
Poo poo doo doo bad
"Fix the bugs and increase drop chances, the game is slowly starting to be tiring to play and repetitive like come on do something cool or new bring us hype once again..."
Makan bang
"Fun with a good sense of progression, but there needs to be a clear way to delete the app; and then come back to reclaim old data."
"Great game. Only complaints is there's no data back up system that i can find. The pull % for certain cards is ridiculously low, but the rate if pull materials is a good balance. Amd a few lag/freeze spikes in battle."
"Played for 5 and a half hours. I never want to go back. The grind. It's too much... To veterans, I salute you."
Curbing my gacha addiction
Gacha gacha gacha gacha
It's a fine game. You can get through most of the games content with a support DPS and many command seals/Quarts Revives. It is very F2P friendly as just stated.(as long as you sacrifice a few gatcha rolls)
"Good Gameplay,Good Players,Good Story, Bad luck, f uck. Best for relaxation."
Fun as hell
padoru padoru
Its great if you love gachas

The superb story in a gacha game
This game has ruined my life
"No pity system, sleep"

"I have over 1000 hours in this game. I'm fully caught up in the story, I've got some of the best units in the game, and it only cost my soul. On a serious note I really recommend this game for anyone looking for a decent story with some surprisingly deep turn based combat. Even lower rarity units have places on some of the best teams, such as Mash, so dont feel bad if you arent getting lucky. You can seriously beat this game with nothing but 3* servants if you play right."
It's a fun mobile game.

Very fast account recovery support.
I really can't get into this game no matter how many times played it. I don't know whh many people playing this game.
Will rate if DW gives me SI
This will always be the best mobile game ever.
"This game has been great, it's Mechanic's are great."
"So good, I got a 5 star hirito, then evolved him into a 6 star, omg i love this, it also gacha. bot a probleum is that 60 summons(2700 gems) is a garuenteed 5 star, also zaruto 6, kira 6"
"Overall enjoying the game, but the gacha rates for 5 star servants feel abysmal"
Beautiful art I love the fate series so I love this game too
"I really love the game and how balance it is for a gacha game, the amount of stuff you need to get a 5 star is crazy but luckily you could easily replace them with free character that are just as good"
Sakuras
If you like the the fate series you'll love this game.
Wrong luck all year. 1 star. Better gimme the right one next year so I can throw some more stars for you beggar!
Really great story
"Here's the problems I encountered so far: frequent disconnection from server, lag(one of the reasons are cuz of my phone), the gatcha (surprise, surprise), it's difficult to grind for servant upgrades and materials without the events (cuz some events has high req. Like finishing the main story 1st, so what about those who are new to the game?) And Ap Regen is slow. That aside I really love the game(also a big fan of the fate series..) keep up the good work üòÅ"
"The app has become increasingly unstable with each update, to the point where it now freezes after almost every mission and the entire app needs to be restarted. Even the menu UI freezes constantly. It's nearly unplayable at this point."
It keeps saying can't connect to server but I have 100mbs connection I tried clearing cache but it doesn't work I have also tried to restart the game client but after I restart the same issue occurs
Good game. Story is amazing and anniversary rewards are way better than any mobile game.
It a great but there are some stuff we can't get from the shop exchange event item is there a we can they can bring them back even the old ones
Fun game just wish you didn't have to spend so much to get the characters you want
The Salt is what drives me to play this game
it exists
"Very nice game,the story from arc 1.5 onwards is really good(along with Babylonia), very f2p friendly, and I can 3turn time attack and farm easily(at least until Skadi can't handle future lvl 90+ nodes anymore) , I play both the NA and JP versions, would rate 5 stars if it wasn't for gacha salt and no pity system üòî"
its hard but fun
"I would put this at 5 stars but i just have to say this now with no way to actually save your game account its kinda bad to start i mean yes if you transfer and keep the code to be able to go on a different device your good but that only works once after that your out of luck, if we had a way to link our accounts so we dont lose all our heros we summon from events and other stuff then it be higher."
"Aside from being one of the worst gacha experiences, the gameplay is nice, the story is great if you enjoy the FATE series, and the characters are amazing."
Pros: -Great Story -Loveable Characters -Banging OST Cons: -Gacha is cancer. Don't get your hopes up
Need Seggs Scene..... Wanna Bang Kagetora
Good stuff
The Best Mobile Game Ever To Hit Google Play Saberrrrr
Fate is always hit or miss. Sometimes you get a new character in one roll. Other times it takes well over 200. It's so random that it's honestly maddening. The story is good and the characters are nice. Wouldn't reccomend though. 10/10

"Fun, but you better never break your phone. There is no way to recover your game if you do. Your just out of any money you spent."
I'm going to be honest the main thing holding this back is grinding and I can't lie about that it's always awful grinding in this game you have to spend multiple days grinding yet in order to get materials to get ready for the next thing and then you have to get thing and but that doesn't matter it's a good game it's really really good game if you care about the story and the characters of which case this would be leagues higher any another mobile game comes to story but still doesn't mean that
Alittle grindy to get through story but great game
"Good story, great characters and my life revolves around this game"
Besto Friendo
"Good game and amazing storyline lmao. The main reason as to why I gave it two stars is because of its terrible gacha. (edit: 5 stars, love the game despite its gacha.)"
Pretty addictive game. Haven't stopped playing since I started. And the franchise is just fantastic
18 ssr in 853 days with 2 have np3. Not bad. All you need is luck
"Fun game, its either up your alley or not, plain and simple. I enjoy the Fate series so its for me. Obviously it can be upsetting when you cant get your preferred gacha rolls, thats gonna happen. Low rates arent favorable, but thats how the game rolls. Its a grind, new players be ready. Either you put in the time and catch up and try and have fun and stick with it, or you fall out because of the committment, or lack thereof. Great story, great character designs, events are enjoyable, good polish"
"Play this game for 5 years, that's it."
It needs auto-battle.
Good game to play at work during break üôÇ
"The best gacha for me despite its abysmal gacha rates. The reason for it is not only because of how well the stories and characters are written to the point you'll feel attached but also because FGO is actually ""f2p-friendly"". You don't need SSR characters to complete the contents (no pvp and you can also borrow other players' servants). All characters, even the two to four stars ones, have useful kits. Grinding is hell coz no auto but worth it because of generous rewards (e.g. lottery event)."
"Honestly, I just got back my account from two years ago. I lost it when I had to switch phones unexpectedly and didn't have a chance to make a transfer code. (Phone broke). Their customer support was fast and amazing. It was a great experience and I'm definitely happy to finally be back on the grind."
: R.Right i 4 8:: B
It's fun while it last that's all
"I downloaded this during anime expo 3 years ago and I'm still playing it. It's not a hard game , the gatcha mechanics suck but after playing for this long I got a decent roster of characters. You can max out and get good characters just from playing the game. Well worth to look up. I have so many different king Arthur's lol"
"Drop rates are better than what they use to be, I've pulled most of my favorite servants. Personally satisfied"
"Classic gacha game with interesting designs. Admittedly on the harsher side with rates, but the developers are able to support the community well enough. Story is touch and go. Mechanics are, well, classic. Graphics and quality of life updates were very much appreciated."
Nobu
"Dear developers, there's Emiya new voiceline in battle but still not added to servants profile, hope you notice this comment"
One of the best gacha games I've played
"Been playing for years and have always enjoyed, definitely can get grindy but once you get moving it becomes pretty easy to be a free to play player. It's also something that you can pretty easily pick up and put down as you have time making it a great game to play long term."
Please fix the gacha system
Hmm.... It is an OK game.Combat is Kinda outdated at this point tbh. Also the Gotcha rate can drive you nutso.
"Been playing this game almost 3 years on the NA server and its been a amazing experience, the story is very good and the gameplay is good. The gacha is easily one of the games problems, rates for 5 stars are pretty bad and the pitty system is pretty much nonexistent even for whales but they have buffed the rates over time. There's also tones of great waifu's/husbando's with really good voice acting, even with my fair share of bad luck in the gacha I still highly recommend anyone to play this."
"Lots to love in this game but there are some issues like the gacha rate and optimization. Personally, the cons don't really impact day to day gameplay, while simplistic is still fun to play. Also, lots of waifu and husbando, can never go wrong with that."
"Everything is great, except the account system. With the transfer code system, the possibility of losing your account is very high."
Very good big brain game ooga booga
"Love it, over 1000 days and still going strong."
Great game sold my soul to the gacha and never came back. üëç
"Good game, but the summon rate is absolutely trash. You have a better chance of getting struck by lightning. Plase be aware of this and good luck if you get a 5 star. To be honest I love this game. Because I love the franchise."
"This game is a certified hood classic, waiting for Fate 2 Greatest/Command."
Thank you Kanou-San for all the rewards üôÇ
The ultimate waifu/husbando collecting gacha game. If you're a fan of Fate then you'll love it. Just hide your wallet.
"Despite me being a free-to-player, I got some limited time 5-star pulls like Gilgamesh, King Hassan, Merlin, Alolan BB and the lewd nun. So yeah, I'll give this a 4 star because my gacha rolls were good. I would've given a 5 but I blew 150 SQ for Jeane alter and got Tristan instead. No tsundere for me. But the story is something I greatly enjoyed. Even when I started with no amazing sr and ssr servant, I still enjoyed the story of saving human history. Also our character crossed the US by foot."
Nice gacha game

"As a visual novel, FGO is fantastic, with a story that starts off decent and has only grown in quality over the years. As a game, a lot of its mechanics are really starting to show their age. As a gacha... there's no safety net, and you have about .5% chance of getting an SSR servant, so keep that in mind before you roll or spend in general. I still play, mostly because I've been here since EN launch and am super invested, but I really would advise any new players to moderate their expectations"
waifu>meta
Game good :) love Nero Supremacy
"Honest review from some who has been playing for 4yrs, f2p and a fate franchise fan. It removes normal fate anime mentality of kill or be killed and brings out the wholesome and the true personality behind the characters. I must say the prices for sq are a bit pricey but given players many chances to gain sq therefore I can remain f2p. I have grown a little attached to the characters through the fantastic plot and with the updated np animation, I stop complaining about where the skip button is."
"I love this game. It hurts me on an emotional level. The story is amazing, and the events are even better. It's just the same thing... over and over. The characters are likable. Why? Overall, 10/10, would recommend to everyonetoplay. Don't play this if you want to continue feeling happiness."
Best gacha game!! Still better than open world gacha games(ÔΩ°„Éª//Œµ//„ÉªÔΩ°) 10/10 Game!
A great game even 3 stars servant can domenate the game ‚ù§Ô∏è but a little bit salty roll but its fine for free to play
Vote 5s v√¨ b√™n Jp 120q NP5 Okita summer
Cuz I like Fate games
It's a love and hate relationship.
Very very good game the story is nice the characters are good the and even the lower rarity characters are better than some high rarity ones the events are a bit grindy but then again all gacha games are like that so all in all very good game I like it a lot
If you guys add pity system this will be the greatwst gacha game tbh
Better anniversary than hen chin
Got Sitonai just now so automatic 5 star
Phenomenal story but starts out slow. Gacha is debatable since NA can see future banners and lucky bags are a thing. Friend support system is great. Only downside is farming since it's the majority of the game. Give this game a try if you like fate or want to walk yourself into hell.
I have nothing to say but I'm giving it a 5 star rate
Both the stories and characters are amazing! This is my favorite game so far.
"This game has the most detailed story and extended story I've ever played. Fate has a special place in my heart after the visual novels, however the only issue with the game is the rates for servants. One day you could spend everything and get nothing or you could just use 5 tickets and get a good SSR. Other then that and the small amount of stamina, the game is great."
5* aren't guaranteed but the story is really great and there are other units you can use.
I love the doujin's made by different mangaka of fgo
Well the reputation for low SSR rate is expected as I heard from my peers but those event exclusive characters and the events are reasonable (example last summer event gave tremendous XP that I levelled up thrice than normal even with only One SSR out of three at full level). The reason I'm giving this high rate is their assistance when I almost lost my account. I managed to recover it within a week and gave advice too (and I finally got my waifu in an unexpected day).
One of the best game of the gacha The story is such Masterpiece of Masterpiece But the gameplay will not please to someone because some of these fools think 3d >> 2D Anyway The character design are soo beautiful The fandoms are nice or wholesome than genshit impact 10/10 stars or 5/5 stars Would not reccomend to anyone if you have gambling addict and terrible mental illness
This game stole all my money and it makes me cry at night
"The gacha rates are the only reason this isn't five stars. The story, the characters, everything is phenomenal. Long live Fate Grand Order."
"After playing for one year and still on going. I must make update my review for 5 star to show my appreciation and support for the game. Good story, enjoyable events, gacha rate is good despite still getting CEs most of the time but getting surprise pulls and almost getting 5 stars for each class. Farming part might be tedious and the NP skip and no auto farm but at least the rewards are worth it. Game wise. I will keep on playing."
"This is the first I liked and loved a gacha game. I always ignored gacha games before because of various reasons (boring plot, too many buttons, auto farms, pay to win, etc.). I loved this game it is balanced and easy to understand mechanics. It also has unique story unlike other games."
This game literally said my connection is bad which is not bad my connection is good I tried everything I restarted my phone nothing now I can't enter the game please do something about this I badly wanna play this gamee

"After playing this game every day for 2.5+ years, I have finally decided to leave a review. Amazing stories (definitely some trash ones too, you can just skip those). Wonderful characters. I also find it very f2p friendly (my personal experience). Generous with currency (saint quartz) if you put in the time. New content is frequent but not overwhelming. Yes I find the rates to be bad and there is NO pity system, but it has none of the predatory practices I see in other gacha or similar games."
I like the game just like How I touch Grass
"Already quitted long ago because of burn out, but this game is really good nonetheless. Helping to counter the manchildren reviewbombing this game"
bedivere ssr or else
Every servant is useful. Even down to the 1 stars. I rlly enjoyed the story and the animations are beautiful.
Give me support servant please DW
"Best f2p gacha rpg game. The story is superb, rivaling paid games like Final Fantasy, the gameplay is unique. The gacha is a hit or miss but that's what made it fun and valuable. And the best of all, the anniversary rewards are fabulous!"
Good game even though RNG is rough but worth it for Waifu collection.
Tamamo vitch plssssssss
This games aight
Best game i love it
Amazing story.
Boring game tutorial.
Better than genshit midpact
Okita san daishouri!
"Massive Type-Moon Fan, been playing since July 2017. I will ride this ship till the end."
Been a og since early 2018 only now reviewing because of genshit asspact
Best Story in YEARS.
FGO is a not a fair game at times but it's fun and has a compelling story as time goes on.
"I've been playing since March of 2019 and I've only had fun since. I play two accounts. One is a whale account that I spend $$$'s every month, the other is F2P. Since starting, I have never missed a single event, let alone a single login on both accounts. I'm in love with the story, gameplay, and characters. Coming from a person who has been playing Azur Lane since launch, a mostly auto farming game, I really enjoy the active gameplay needed to play this game."
Great game love the story
"The game has terrible rates and it can be difficult, but many boss fights can be exploited and supports let free to play players try strategies that would never work otherwise. Many low rarity units are solid and can beat most content and when you do eventually get high rarity units, many are perfectly serviceable at one copy, along with free units that come with most events. All in all, this game has a great story and it's perfectly possible to only want units you love."
"I think its very fun. You are never truly out of options as the welfares are generally at least good if not outright amazing. While the low rates can put a hamper on the experience, I feel like anyone who is a Type Moon fan[not only Fate] can enjoy FGO's story, as its story is easily the most amazing part of the game. While they are getting more generous as the month go by and we catch up to JP, I do hope they eventually see the value a spark system adds to whales and F2Ps."
"I played this game since 2015, both EN and JP versions and it has gotten very stale for me. No spark/pity system in 2021 is very disheartening. Not to mention the lack of regard for long-time players and additions to their older servants. I loved the time I had with it, but I feel that it's at the end of its lifespan... Only spend that $15-20 on the yearly guaranteed *5 banners and your pain will be severely mitigated when servers tank one day. Also, NO AUTO PLAY???? ü§Æü§è"
"If you like fate and want to pull your favorite characters and don't care about your wallet health then go ahead. Gameplay can get boring at times, and lack of an auto farming system has put me off the game. But I do still enjoy the game here and there."
Probably one of the weakest gacha games I've played. Story can be good sometimes but its an RPG thats missing key elements of an RPG. And no spark system really makes the summoning punishing.
"Story is a slog, gameplay is unengaging, and rates (both items and gacha) are straight up unbearable. I can't believe I played this for 3 years. I want every dollar back."
When the melty blood/tsukihime crossover
"Its fun but super grindy, lack of pity in the gacha also kinda stinky."
Great game and great story. If your a fan of Fate series you'll gonna love this game.
I am forever trapped in this game thanks Nero Bride. ‚ù§
story is good. bad gacha rate though.
"Great anniverseries, great story, Amazing waifus 10/10"
"The writing for each story is so good but what impressed me the most is that the craft essence rate up is so consistent than the actual units/characters' rate up in the game :D. Jokes aside, I really like the fact that you can clear this game with some of the low rarity units if you put some effort in them. Its a fun game, just don't take it too seriously."
Good game good waifus

The story is too good bruh
quite nice

A great game from a great franchise
"Great game, lots of characters and fun events."
While the gacha system still needs work the game itself is one of my favorite games! I've been playing for almost 3 years now and story is amazing as well as all the art! :)
"Game nh∆∞ c·ª•c cuc, n√≥i th·∫ø cho n√≥ vu√¥ng"
As much as i like this game i can't really recommend it because of the nature of the game but this does have really good story. Edit: don't expect anything from the gacha in this game I've been playing for atleast 550 days and i have 7 ssr so just a caution if ur planning to play this game doing 100 pulls won't guarantee you the ssr chara you want heck it can also mot give you any ssr at all
"Nice but needs a better way to link account, it's rates are pretty stingy, and the future of the game is too grindy. As much as I love it, it's not worth it tbh."
Saber in MBTL. bad civ.
Hasn't changed much but still as fun as ever. Story just keeps getting better. Experience the salt life. :')
"A friend recommended this game. Boyyy she was so addicted to it ever since its release and all she spat when we chat is FGO this, FGO that. It made me curious so I tried as well. I did not regret the experience. It's incredibly grindy, but it's fulfilling when you win battles and get your waifus/husbandos. Babylonia is my absolute favorite. Cheers to more campaigns, events, banners and future contents!"
Far from perfect but always improving giving us the QoL from the JP version early really helps me to have fun in this game more.
Love this game :3
NOTHING TO SAY....JUST 5 STARS
they added Saber to type lumina
"This is the only game that I played for so long, great story, waifus, amazing Gameplay, Fun event. Really one of the best game."
No auto but full of waifus and husbandos
It's a gacha
Gift Ticket Summon
better than genshit
FUNüôÉ
"I love this game. The story, waifus, and fans have all been great to me. The only thing this game needs to better rates."
"F/GO is an overall positive experience, but it has quite a few crippling flaws. One of them is the gacha system. There is no way to count how many you have done, no pity system, myriads of 10x summons with just one 4-star CE & nothing else and more. The gameplay also turns into a cycle of unrelenting tedium, where you use the same skills and NPs almost hundreds of times to finish the events. Sure, you can use low rarity servants, but they're not as exciting or interesting as higher rarity ones."
One of the most balance gacha games i ever played
best game
üòÑ
"Best game, very kind developer."
Really need syncing options. I've got a lot of games on my phone and absolutely no time to generate a new code each time I want to play FGO on different devices.
Good game but last time roll 5 star is 5 month ago
223ex'
These JPEGs are worth the grind.
add pity pls
Awesome!
Each individual story/chapter in this game is A tier on story telling the rest of the gacha system is probably bad. but coming from a guy who loves story telling this is an amazing game
Good game but I hope that your account can be binded to Facebook/Gmail. Recently lost my acc.
RATE UP IS A LIE
good game good story bad gacha
Sex like the old times
"I'm going to be 100% honest in saying I'm only playing this game to see Astolfo. He's so nice. I wish I was just like him. Fun game though, nice to pick up and play once in a while."
"Such a great game,but atleast give me one ssr hehe"
"Great game, but bastardizes and flanderizes the original stories of FSN and others to make it work in a game."
The rates suck
"Other games appear better bcuz of their sub genre (open world RPG), but as a gacha game in the strictest sense this is one of the best. Gacha games are defined by their story and characters. FGO does very well in both. Every character has their niche and their time to shine in both story quests and events, all of which have exposition that last for hours. You will share experiences with everyone on the roster and more. Lastly, the compensation and rewards are generous. Players are valued well"
"I really enjoy the game. That's it, that's enough for me to give the game a 5 star and thank you cause this game really saved me from quarantine and boredom."
Rlly i need to complete losebelt first before i enter the eventü§®bruhüòë should have just made it accessible to all players old and new ones.
"I know many people love this game but it's not for me, the gameplay gets boring for me and feels repetitive and as for the Gacha I won't quote anything I've seen worse rate before and as for the story I didn't skip all of them it might be the reason it ruin the game to me but who cares its fate but the story is actually good ngl"
I like nobu
Not enough cat girls i stg
"There are too many times that the opponent gets special privilege, and can only be defeated by a special strategy. The ascension materials are infuriatingly rare, after the game stops giving you freebies. You can't even level your characters by battling, only by consuming other characters or exp cards, and it takes way too many exp cards to level up, if they are that useless they should be more common."
"Game is great and all but I don't know it's the problem of my phone or new update, recently on the battles voices just crash and it will be okay after the battle,this mostly happens on new event,pls fix it it's so annoying"
ü•±ü•±ü•± boring history is now anime girl ü•±ü•±ü•±
"DO NOT download this game if you are not already a fan of the Fate series, it wants you money and your time, and does not care what it needs to do to get it. This painful pit of suffering is one of my favourite games."
"Great game, SUPER LOVE IT!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Truly the Gacha experience that never gets old. No matter how many years go by, I continue logging into this game. If you really get into it, there's a fair chance you won't stop playing it."
I can't recover my account what is this
"I have fallen in love with this game so, so much. The story is amazing, the characters, and the waifus, are amazing, and the gameplay, while not the best, is still great at its own right, especially after the game engine update. I wish that the devs can be more like the azure lane devs with their gifts and their great interaction with their respective community though. Furthermore this game still has need for major changes like their pity system, which has made a lot of people I know quit."
Goodbye real life and hello my precious servants. I'm a huge fan of the fate series and this game is hella additive. The story plot is amazing! The interactions between the characters are adorable. Blessed by the gacha.
Fate is good
got gilgmesh best game ever
"Been playin for over 2 years now still anticipating more content. The gacha aspect was a bit of a hurdle to get used to, but was able to just accept whoever and whatever comes. The stories have become disturbingly easy for playing for a long time which was a nice change after the gruelling ones when starting out. But, to summarize, it is still enjoyable nonetheless, plus the salt will make you appreciate those who come after."
Where's the update?
I like this game because it's fun and I can play with my darkness and I will finish this to the game and the story and I will keep going I would never ever ever stop this game I will keep going to the end and I will get what I want I will become as the dark King and you should try this game it's fun and it brings me joy and makes me want to meet newbie and help them out and I hope the highest rank and I will support them and I will take responsibility it is complain some haters it's not my probl
"Well the Discord bot brought me to something very, very interesting."

Predatory game. Don't waste your time.
Great details and skills needs better upgrade system though
Good waifus
"I change my rate from 2 to 4 star, after 1 year of playing at last, I finally obtain some 5 star charaters, including Medb and Anastasia."
"I love this game... I'm fate series fan... Thankful that it have a Philippines Server. It's a nice game... RPG that I can enjoy myself to keep relax and fun from being stressed in Studies.. Only I wish (If the Holy Grail was true...) is to develop new heroic spirits from our country, Philippines like Lapu-Lapu (Saber), Jose Rizal (Caster), Gabriela Silang, (Rider), Andres Bonifacio (Ruler) and Etc. Our national heroes. üòÅüòä"
very good husbando game
gacha in this game would make you want to commit suicide.
good game / gg
It's a decent time killer. I started playing this game a few days ago and it's a simple concept to get around. Does feel slightly grindy having to do a single stage multiple times but it is what it is. Da Vinci is my waifu.. No one else can have her.
"Game yang bagus,cerita and gameplaynya menarik"
I have spent so. Much. Help. Also astolfo is best girl Astoria lily and medusa lily must be protected Thank you fate
Beautiful game.
This game is omg the grahics the character is so cool like omg
"I really like this game, one problem though. It's almost impossible to be ""free to play"" in this game(The gacha rates are way too bad and they're too costly)."
"Mechanics work solidly and consistently. Well thought out and balanced gameplay. Graphics and animations are top tier as far as phone games go. One major catch, the stories and writing that you expect from the Fate series is mind numbingly absent, like, in the reverse. Hilariously bad writing. But if you can overlook the writing, good, fun game with deep mechanics and your pick of your favorite servants."
Fun and absorbing. Just watch how much you spend on Saint Quartz!
It's been a year since my last 5 star rate up servant... but i still love this game
Like everything except the grind (am just lazy) and the greediness (am broke). Other gacha games are not as punishing to f2p peeps like me.
fgo is good civilization.
Welcome to gacha hell
Salty !
Anti luck
"Good story , cool gameplay"
Absolute trash tier account system. Going from phone to tablet and having to transfer accounts back and forth is absolute garbage. Lost my transfer code and now I cant access it either device. This game would be be halfway decent other than that. Absolute dealbreaker.
"I love the game because it is still F2P friendly, even in the Lostbelts."
Story 10/10 ‚ô°‚ô°
"I have been playing this game for more than 4 years now, and it still remains to be one of the most played games I ever played. The story and character development in this game is amazing. Epic battles, epic heroes, and overall great gameplay."
"It makes me discover a history that I never knew. Althought there are some gender bender character in history, I like how they made it like the history did happen. Simple turn base gameplay and very nice character design. There after some character that are a bit too revealing but overall, I love the game and story..."
"One of the longest running Gacha RPGs, this F2P has an amazing story, events every month, free rewards, and Servants and more. It is recommended that you have a good amount of free time, and are willing to grind for resources. Online guides will be a great help, because there are many menus and activities that aren't fully explained. Beware this game for its Brutal chance systems, for both low item drops and extremely rare 5* Servants. Don't spend too much money, you might not get anything."
"I've been playing this game for about 3 and 1/2 years now, and I have no real complaints. As a fan of the Fate series this obviously gives me my fix, the system itself is very easy to learn, somewhat difficult to master. Depending on a gacha system can be frustrating, especially whenever you can't ever seem to get the servants you want. But you can always use your friend supports and still experience that service until you can get them for yourself."
Basta maganda itong game.
Lostbelt is dragging... Not looking forward to how it may never end.
Hah not a bad gacha game. This game is really fun to play with it thanks for Aniplex.
"Gameplay is fine and the gacha rates are depressing, no pity and abysmal chances. But the free to play characters you can get are good enough to the point that getting 5 stars are more of a luxury rather than a necessity, still they of course make getting through the game much easier and friends are easy to get. The playerbase is pretty nice so you can friend people with many good and built 5 stars are easy. If you blow money and still don't get the character you want, you shouldn't be surprised. The story and lore is what is the main highlight of the game. To play this game is to sell your soul."
gacha hell lmao
This game is stupid Astolfo is NOT a starting character. What were the developers thinking? Are they insane? Extremely unhappy. üò°üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°üò°ü§¨üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

Great game love it but i hate the Account code stuff iv had to restart so many times because the code dosent work i wish i could link it to facebook or somthing besides that i have no problems with the game
Trash rate
"As much as I prefer older Type-Moon stories, I can't deny that the most recent story arcs set a new bar for storytelling in mobile games. Highly recommended for story alone"
"I redownload this game about a year ago and have had nothing but a great experience. After some technical difficulties from transferring to a new account their support services were able to assist me quickly and efficiently. I am so happy to continue to grow my team and have the opportunity to obtain my favorite servant, Da Vinci. Fate is so much fun and I cannot recent it enough."
Great game with amazing gameplay
Fun :)
Rates are crazy low. Spent 600 on a character and never got them.
I love the manga and the anime show
good game ngl
GREAT!üòÜ
Fantastic
saber is better than jalter fight me
Gatcha system suck
Trash gacha
gachas kinda steep but great anime game...2d animations are stunning...
best game ever
Excellent for FATE fans
Beautiful Game. Especially if your a fan of fate series.. With good unique stories.. lots of freebies for newcommers hope they add more for newcommers the gameplay is very fun and rewarding to collect servants.. hope more content with it and a chance for newcommers to acquire 5* servant.. üòéüëåüíØ
pls gib more free saint quartz thx love u delight works
Pull rates suck
Okay.....i guess I've been doing well...for now at least. Though the story is still great but cmon were not always horny DW. Lore accuracy please.
"Love this game for its nigh-endless content and promise of content for years to come... But, glitches ahoy unless you've got a brand new phone. I literally can't even buy extra saint quartz right now because the google play screen won't let me progress to pay. Implement *properly*, people. Otherwise, can't get enough, very easy to pick up and play to pass time."
Kekw
One of the best games I have ever played
Great game but we need something like a room design for our servants
One of the best game i played (not recommended)
"The game is very dependent on its gotcha system. The main focus of this can lead to absurd spending. Not to mention the process or Leveling your units is absurd and time consuming. The story and characters, however, more than make up for this. Some campaigns can run cutscenes that are ten hours long. It is fun, entertaining, and emotional all at once. Just be sure to experience every other Fate entry before starting this."
It's great fun and exciting no prob for me just please Add more event's not only in gacha
"Truly one of the best gacha RPG game I have played. With tons of great characters catering to all, an engaging story, top notch music and some of the industries best artists come together. You're missing out a lot of you're still not playing this game xD"
"You can clear story quest with low rarity servant and grail them. However, the challenge quest completely a joke when you cannot use command code to continue the challenge. The game clearly want you to use a ex tier support servant from gacha to clear it."
"This game is fun overall. But I only have a few complaints. 1. The gacha is absolute trash. A .8% drop rate for 5star servants with no pity system apart from USO (Unregistered saint Origins.) Which only rewards the whales, is kinda ridiculous. 2. Ever since the more recent updates which increased the game speed, I had to deal with more screen freezes than I can count. 3. Ever since Gilgamesh got his animation update. The game runs at a snails pace every time I attack with him. Except for his NP."
Gime me *5 pliss
Boring game play sucks your soul out by having to grind nonstop events with no speed up or auto battle for missions already completed 50 times. If they didn't make you spam the same mission 100+ times to get imaginary points that do nothing I would give 3 stars. But I shall forever bench my 3000 dollars spent characters on the game becuz the publisher doesn't care about it's player base.
"I liked playing this game, and I'll keep playing it but I had 3 five star characters and then one day my game just crashed and restarted me. I don't know if I can get those back but I'd like to if it's possible"
I'm Addicted
"I've been playing this game for over three years and within that span of time, I felt bittersweet with the game."
"I love the gameplay! Usually having to grind just to level up would annoy me, but for this one it actually makes every level up feel so much more gratifying! I do find the long sequences of dialogue often tedious, but I don't mind it too much. Love it!"
Don't play this Game...its Hell you're walking into
Is a fun game
"Basic .png collection gacha game with an atrociously low rate to summon SSR cards. Has a shallow and boring combat system, visual novel and card clicker is the best description I can think of for its genre. Also has no auto battle functions, which you may like but I found it to be incredibly tedious and that is why I uninstalled and left a 1 star."
ilovethisgamesomuch
After leaving this game 2 years ago coz of no luck in the gaccha i have tried almost hundred gaccha android games but none have come close to FGO. I dunno what is it about it but FGO is just so much more fun and addicting. So I'm back playing it... And gaccha has been treating me well lately so .... 5 stars
"Rate SSR this game is so low, with no guarantee get ssr even after spend alot money."
Good and ok
NICE WAIFU
Kuay
why do i always get terrible rolls this game hate me or something.. :/
The gameplay is outdated and boring. There is a lot of grind and it's tedious with no skip/auto play. The gacha is absolutely atrocious with no pity and chance to not even get the unit you want. The saving grace of this game is it's amazing story and how f2p friendly it is. If you only care about story and the fate franchise it's pretty good. Otherwise I can't recommend the game.
"The game is good and all but could we perhaps get a pity summon? I've been summoning like atleast 20 times and still haven't gotten a five star, other than that the game is good in my opinion"
"I found this game years ago. I didn't play it for a while, but now I'm interested into it. But, they have to fix the saving data restore. I lost all of my data because I tried again and it didn't allow me. That's a total bug!"
"I would rate higher, but it's held back by the versions not being simultaneous. We gotta catch up to the Japanese version one day"
I love the game but it freezes up very often. But other then that i have no complaints its really cool and keeps me interested which I find very hard nowadays as game get really boring.
I just like game
"Stellar story and characters. If you're a Fate fan, I highly recommend you to try this game. While its gacha rate is abyssmal, its collections of waifus more than makes up for it. I like how low-maintenance this game is as in you can log in once for the daily reward and call it a day! It lacks competitive gameplay, allowing me to enjoy the game without that pressure. The only downside of this game is that its graphics and gameplay are outdated by today's standards."

It's so good and i love the animation
Give me sq
Pretty bad for me. Drop rate of material and ssr n sr servant really low
"It's a good game but the gacha is really bad it needs a pity system so that the hardwork of the player will be payed off, but overall it's a good game so I will give a 5 star..."
I know that this is gacha but it's annoying how it keeps giving me craft essence instead of 4* servants.
i love how this game hits you with reality like come on gimme gilgamesh >:(
Game keeps freezing for android
üôá
"Bruv, you know my complaints"
I lost my account so many time
"Fate good, gacha bad"
Too many female characters üòâüòâüòâ
"Finally been waiting for this to appear in english since I learned that the anime originally comes from this, I hope to see the rest of the fate/ series appear as well. Won't install even after I deleted apps and made space space, ZERO STARS"
"Wonderful game. Graphics are fantastic and being updated regularly. Love the numerous characters. Events, even though I'm fairly new, are interesting and somewhat easy to complete (not super hard but super easy either). The rate of 5 star draws is pretty darn low but I've been able to get two 5 star characters in a little over a month. I've spent $0."
bad gacha but I still comeback 10/10 made me a masochist
Good game its just a bit hard in early part of the game especially finding materials.
I love this game its amzing
"I like it. The gameplay is simple and entertaining, and the characters are all so cool. My only complaint is the gacha. I'd prefer if it was a shop system, but oh well."
"I play FGO JP and then move to EN and play from day 1 relase campaign. The Story are incredible, Gameplay is turn based classic, Character design, voice, and lore is awesome. Character management is quite simple maybe confusing at first. f2p friendly (maybe not everyone). Downside? GACHA IS HELL, Ember and upgrade material is grindy, You need RNG god at your side to obtain what you want that, spend money if you want. I lost my account but i get it back in 4 days (thank you customer service)."
"Overall, the game is good but it would be nice to have a way to sync an account across multiple devices without needing new transfer codes every time."
Best !
Love Nasuverse and UFOTABLE but my God.. boy this game probably has one of the worst gacha in the whole wide world. Gonna keep playing f2p simply because i already know what i am getting if i spend money on this.
all i can say is great gameeeeeee but my phone little bit can't handle graphics but its good
Best fate game with gacha. The story is good and amusing. Those voices are really amazing.
Bc of astolfo
"Love it, coming from a champion"
Luck = 0
this game has some issues and needs better updates I just lost a whole bunch of saint Crystals trying to summoning and because it glitched.
This is a grindy gacha hellfest with the best disappointment you'll ever feel when you don't roll the servant you airways wanted.
Okay gacha game of course gacha is abysmal
Game is top tier although the rates makes me want to jump off a building it's still a good game
The gacha rates are abhorrent.
S) acc fgo 1200+ days
was fun for a while but the format of the gameplay gets very stale very fast. You do the same combos the whole game
"Over 1000 quartz and several hundred tickets, still no Merlin. Good thing you can beat the game without ever summoning anything. It is just more efficient to use quartz to continue."
Could be better. Fully voiced story and Live2D movements for the dialogues would be nice
Hhmm yeah
Good game would definitely recommend to other gatcha players
Awesome game
Summon rate trash.
"It's a good game with great story. My only complaint is that the loading time is just way too slow to the point where it is annoying. And, yeah, it's just very hard to get a 5 star servant even if you have hundreds of gems. It's all down to luck(is it?). Also, pls at least make a more safe account bind, I have a friend who got 18 SSRs for an F2P player and the devs can't do anything for him because of being F2P. Pretty scared to lose my account thus forcing me to buy SQs for the sake of it."
Ok the the is amazing took a bit of time for it to get here however i do really love this game the story and characters all make it wonderful I'm happy I've been able to play and love this game for so long
Impossible to raise characters for free
Honestly the gameplay is outdated I only play because my friends play it. If you dont hate yourself avoid this game at all cost. The gacha is really predatory and punishing.
"The gameplay is entertaining though the farming is excessive, but as a waifu and husbando collector all else pale. I've never seen another Gacha put this much story and personality in their characters. Of course that is because this is from the Fate series and has extensive mangas and animes to draw from, but you don't have to have seen anything from the Fate series before to enjoy it. If anything, maybe playing FGO will make you want to watch the series later."
"The fate series.. the most complicated series ever! Game is great for fans but not so great for the wallet. The chances of getting 5 star units is slim to no chance. The game wants you to spend thousands just for a chance at something good. The worst part is that all your progress isnt saved into an account or anything so if your device breaks, say goodbye to the progress youve made and units you've collected. Plz for the love of god add a feature to save our progress in case our device breaks!!"
The gacha is terrible but the story is good
I need to read history books again. And please for the love of God give me some luck to summoning a decent servant!!!!
"Always had a good time playing, love the character designs and story!"
Give Kintoki
"Cant even play it because apparently it needs updated but I checked the play store and there was no indication for an update, can't login, can't update it but for the one time I did play it I enjoyed it. Until this is fixed 2 stars."
takes all my money üëç
I love anime so much
"Probably hard to get into for most players, but the slow burn is worth it. Easy to play when you're just trying to kill 5 minutes."
"Been playing the game for almost a year now, and I can say with certainty that it was worth my time. The story the game provides is great, and really makes you invested in the characters and the world of FGO. The only problem I would say the lack of a pity system. Yeah, I have a lot of 5* servants, but I can still complain about the static 1% chance of getting a 5* servant. If the game had a pity system, this would have been a 5/5."
"The game is a ton of fun, but it is not without it's problems. Major Pros: -All the characters to choose from and a easy to learn leveling system makes it fun to get new characters and level them up. -The combat is very fun and simple. Making it easy to pick up, but hard to master. Major Cons: -The long cutscenes with not a lot happening on screen. Most cutscenes run at least a few minutes, if not up to 10 minutes. -The long grind to get characters to their max."
Can't update the game so I can't play it. Thanks Google.
"This is a very great game. I was very happy about this app because I loved fate zero. However, this game is not without its flaws and shows its old age like an IPhone, the gameplay depth is lacking comparing to other competitors, the content outside of main story and events are non-existent (for me, in between events would be a period of hiatus because there is nothing for me to do), and the HUD bring me back a lot of memories because it reminds me of the windows XP days."
Worst gacha system. game doesn't feel rewarding. glad i could quit. Whoever is playing for over a year or two just have to have Stockholm syndrome
Pretty good but VERY niche
Improve your gacha rate. üôÇüôÇ
üëçüëçüëç
5/5 Gacha hell.
"Pretty good 5 stars are rare, but luckily I got jack the ripper on free 10 summon events give free quartz pretty frequently so you will have a chance to get a few good summons every so often. Sadly that is the only time you have a chance of getting summoning quartz in small boosts. It's possible to get 5 star heroes just don't expect to get your desired hero it's pretty much make do with what you got."
Game good. Ignore salty bad reviews that talk about the gacha aspect.
The story is good and the game play is fun. The gacha is too harsh though.
"Gatcha is hell.. Farming is hell.. Gameplay is... ok. (CQ's are he'll though) Story? characters? Lore? ...convoluted, and WILL rip your heart out. Love this game..ü•∞"
"Playing for almost a year now, the only game I can play while having a very busy everyday life"
Best game ever (character and story wise).
The Top Best Game I'm play it right now Story is Amazing and you can learn those History of Heroic Spirit from Past and summon them to defend Humanity from Enemy of Humanity is Amazing and I'm hope In Future add more Story and Event and also Servant as well
Awesome game love every minute of it!!!!
"Its Fate Grand Order 11/10 Good story (Camelot onwards) Amazing soundtrack (It good dont argue) Gacha (LOL) Great game cant recommend, once u in, good luck getting out"
A nice ongoing storyline building upon the Fate/ mythos!
Hate this game but so love this game at the same time
This is the best game I ever played xD
635 days in the game man i still hate this game
"If you're playing FGO just for the Gacha then you're playing the wrong game. No auto-play? Then FGO is not your game. Been playing since launch in 2017. FGO has a classic kind of RPG battle system, which I love. The game is easy to understand as well as the UI layout. The story is also engaging. The characters are all unique in their own ways. I love the artwork, the seiyuus, the songs, everything. But I will admit FGO is Gacha Hell. Edit: Still, I will never abandon FGO for as long as I live."
Game is great if you are a fan of the franchise The rates are abysmal and there is no pity pull... Play at your own risk. The gacha system needs a revamp. Pity system should be added. Its sad to think that someone who spent over 2k sqz and not getting any ssr is insane. Please work on that.
get nothing from gacha
Very fun and challenging even for f2p.
"Resource management game ,even the character rolls too"
"I'm an F2P player and i got 2x nero bride in a 10x pull, then after a week playing my account suddenly got lost due to error of transfer number but i contacted the support, and it took only 24hrs to recover my acc. THANKYOU SO MUCH FGO! LOVE IT!"
Suuuuuch a grindy game. If you dont have time to grind dont download. Its alot of fun and there are alot of cool elements but the only thing i really despise is the in game purchases. I will make in game purchases often if a game is really good and the prices are reasonable but this game charges 1 dollar for 1 in-game currency (saint quartz) and that's pretty unreasonable.
My luck sucks
walked into gacha hell and havent looked back since üòîüëå
"For those curious with new sorts of shenanigan mix with bit of history and games, this is the game your lookin for!"
Constantly updating to the point it won't fit on my phone anymore. Ridiculous.
HAHA GACHA GO BRRR
Somebody liberate me from this gacha hell...
Murder Merlin
Best history fantasy game
Fate do i really have to say anymore
:))) sugoi
Awesome game.
Grand game
love the game its been a really fun experience playing this game and its for sure one of my favorites games
Iskandar... heh.
"Gacha rates are pretty bad, even for a gacha game. Other than that, it's fine, I guess."
"Amazing game, with exceptional customer service! Farming for materials can get a bit tedious but at the end of the day you'll make it, overall amazing game although the catch is that getting 5 star servants is impossible, 4 stars are somewhat manageable but 5 starts have a normal drop rate of .75 percent or something around that, and the drop rate up servants go to 1 percents. PLEASE MAKE THE RATES HIGHER!!! Besides that the game is very enjoyable"
I love the Fate franchise
I have played this game for almost five years. The story is great. The characters are great. Art great. Cons would be there is no pity system you live and die by the gacha gods
This game is really fun
"This game is perfect for time killing, I mostly play on the treadmill, before i know it its been 45 minutes. I do recommend people with obsessive collecting tendencies or spending/gambling issues dont play, cause the gache system will get to you. I've had fantastic luck with it... sometimes, but the temptation to spend is there. Once I spent a certain ammount, what I felt the game deserved for the value it represents, I stopped, but there are moments. Combat system = Love~ by the way."
"Always have issues with the update not showing on google play, but that's not their fault."
I know a lot of people are complaining about the gacha rates but ive found that you can get better gachas by lvling I gacha 1 time out of every gacha event and ive gotten 3 5* in 1 gacha this was after i had almost maxed out everyone else The trick is to make sure each character you have is at least at stage 3 ascension and yes i also mean the 2*and 3* Absolutely all of them; the more ascensions you have the higher gacha rate you get; ive gotten almost every single 5* this way.
Please give us free 5star servants. And more SQ!!!!
Thicc Waifu
Best Anime game ever played!
"The story starts out dreadfully slow for the first 5 or so chapters, which is a shame because the story is one of its main draws. The combat is nothing special but not bad. Just kinda generic and a little dated. Art is generally quite good with only a few exceptions, and the characters really do carry the game. The only problem is the gacha is abysmal. Be warned, there is no pity system and the ssr rate is only 1%, so unless you've got deep pockets be prepared to plan out a year+ in advance."
WHERES MY MONEY
GACHA?! GACHA GACHA GACHA!
Not recommend
"Only play this if you like the Fate series and have tons of free time, play while watching a tv show or YouTube video in the background"
Summon rates are terrible and the quartz are so overpriced
Only played a couple weeks. Loving it so far! I have been playing one piece treasure cruise and the Simpsons tapped out for years. This game seems promising!
"Don't play its trash, but I'm a fate simp"
"Fun strategy game with characters pulled from history, lore, and literature. Constantly updating."
Pay to win
best gacha of all time
Entertaining
Its a good game
A fun game to grind
"Just like the units I can only get with my ungodly luck. Oh, and amazing gameplay, voice acting, characterizations, and animations are great too."
"Truly one of the hardest yet enjoyable gacha games to play. This doesn't offer pity for pulls like the recent generations of gachas,farming for pulls are tedious and the character pool is so large but the amount of time you can play and story to enjoy outweigh all that since you don't need specific characters to play unless you're a meta slave. Due to its large fanbase you can guarantee it's a game don't won't suddenly shutdown."
„Éô„Çπ„Éº„Éà„Éº„Ç≤„É†
The rate of 5 and 4 star characters are so stupidly low its annoying and the amout of useless CE's are also stupidly high. They probably should balance it out more.
The game is fun to play but the gacha is wayyyyyy too difficult and brutal. I hope the team does something about this so the gacha system somewhat less anxiety inducing and more rewarding
Gacha is the same as gambling there is no pity. If your lucky then your lucky.
Great but the gacha summoning pool is total Garbage. I had three Hundred Saint Quartz and rolled for First Hassan and got Absolutely Nothing. Not even a Five star servant. That's BS.
"I love fate/grand order, it's one of the many games I wanted to play since I was a kid but I had trouble with it's story"
"Decent turn based game with deck building elements. It is showing its age as far as QoL and mechanics are concerned. Gacha rates are also some of the lowest when compared to contemporary games, with no pity to boot."
Where Is The Update?
"Great game and mechanics especially if played with friends who have OP servants lol. Bummer it doesn't have auto fight but not that I blame it. With the same characters, you still have a chance to lose the battle so I think it's fine. Additionally, coming back after some break, I lost my recovery code and thanks to the friendly and prompt support team, I have my beloved servants back! 10/10 still a 5 star review"
"Game experience is fun but customer service though. I like this game, and I played it on pc with bluestacks. Thee recent update 10/10 make fgo unplayable on bluestacks. Because I didn't have my transfer code saved, I have to email fgo support for help. So far it's been 24 hours and I sent 3 emails, but I got no response at all. The customer service is so bad that I have to give it a 1 star even though the game experience worth much more. Would update my rate if I got my problem solved."
Amazing Fate game! Just wish The Farming drop rates were a bit better (Especially Knight Medals From Camelot and Bullets from LB1)
Nice game yes
"If you're playing this just for the gacha and waifus, you're playing it wrong."
It wont let me enter thr game (i downloaded it just now and when i enter the app it just black screen) this is my first time playing and it wont load even when i redownload it from the playstore pls help!
im satisfied to play this i see that this game is good hopefully More to play it GL‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö
Needs higher rates
"The story is great, the fights are great and I am still waiting for animation updates too.. still wishing of enhancing the animation thats all"
This games gacha mechanics are the worst out of every single game I have ever played. I was looking at some of the odds on a single character. It was .041%. One draw is 3 dollars. Think about that before playing.
I have played Fate going on 3 years now and have poured more money into this game than I'd like to admit but with the release of so many new gacha games it's hard to recommend this. The gacha system can be brutal compared to the likes of other gacha games that are arguably more fun and more free to play friendly. The gameplay system is fun at times in the more challenging content but ultimately it gets super repetitive when grinding out events or doing dailys i.e. no autoplay options........
"good story, bad graphics"
"Story is great, main and events I'd give that a 5/5. What's quite bad is the overall unforgivingness of the game. No pity is pretty much a red flag already, along with a 1% rate, game. What's more is that older players can only get 6SQ per week without events. UI isnt optimized for newer devices, farming is laborious and still no NP skip. But Waifus are top tier, writing is great and if you have loads of time then this game is quite the time killer."
The gacha is on the list of the bad ones but everything else is ok I wish the events could be played by new players too instead we have to clear the entire game.
üëçüëçüëçüëç
Give me 5star Artoria
It Kicks me Out Too Much
"VERY Hard to get SSR, Please add more events!"
Lame for new player. they dont have any good servant for pick up cause of so much RNG mech happening so its only biase.
Easy to lose data
This is a Amazing game the story is great and I like the variety of servants the only problem I have is the gacha and it's a large game I hoping to come back to this one when I have a lot more space
Need to put a reroll system so we don't have to delete the game to start over again and again just to get the servants we want but other than that the game is really good.
Really fun
Best story out of a mobile game I've ever played
"I absolutely love this IP but this gacha is outdated. Card arts are beautiful and the story is great, but you can admire that on Google/YouTube. I actually don't mind the gameplay but the gacha is brutal. No gacha game should make you have to not pull for a year to get a unit you want in the future ,and there isn't even a pity. Point of a gacha game is to rng pull, instead you build anxiety over months hoping you get x unit"
crippling gacha addiction
"Bad gacha rates, that all I wanted to say. I rather invest more on other game like hi3 or genshin compared to this, at least they provided soft pity gacha system to player and also better gameplay. Although the gameplay and storyline are nice but still I will not recommend this game to other player since this game is kinda waste of money and time."
"Overall the game is fine. I really only play to interact with my favorite characters. None of which I have. My biggest gripe is the gache system. Most gache games have one of three styles. 1. Low summoning materials, but high summon rates. 2. Lots of summoning material, but low summon rates. 3. Somewhere in between. However, this game incorporates the worst parts. Hard to get summon currency and terribly low rates. It also has a horrible paid part. The quartz or whatever are way overpriced."
Story 4/5 Gamplay4/5 Gacha3/5
I rolled 150 quartz for merlin but i received nothing... Why??!!!
Game feels slow.
"If you have watched and liked any Fate series, you will love this game. The game allows you to summon some of the cool characters/servants you see on the TV, and each of them has different skills and capabilities. However this is a gotcha game and the number of good powerful servants you can get is reliance to your luck and your wealth. Recently, this game gives me an connection issue and I could not connect to the game unless I switched to mobile data"
"I've been playing this game for 3 years, and I love it. The story is mind-blowingly good (as expected of Type-Moon!), the characters are all unique and interesting, and the gameplay is fun. The gacha is pretty brutal (no pity) but you don't even need a single 5* in order to clear the hardest content ingame, because the free/low-rarity units are absolutely amazing. It can get pretty grindy (ESPECIALLY if you have a lot of SSRs!), but I'd take that over the game being p2w . 100/10"
Still no account system!?
How dose this game do so well the drop rates are utter trash it takes forever to grind up star quartz I love fate but this is monatizing at its best you have to be a whale to enjoy this game cause theres no pity system at all in this its sad to see one of my favorite anime series drop this low beginers beware its a trap
No ssrü•∫ü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ß
"It's just really good, to be honest."
The game is great. Although theres a chance that it loses your account when you havent making an account. Then uninstall it. I know im an idiot but is there you can do about it?
"The Quintessential Gacha(tm) experience. A (sometimes) good story that will force you through: grinding hell from which their is no escape, an upgrade system that gets more complicated each passing year, and abysmal summoning rates that makes throwing your money into a pit of fire look like a better financial decision in comparison. However, the girls are cute. Overall 10/10 I will be be liquidating my assets for Ishtars next summon banner wish me luck mates I dont even like Fate all that much"
Game used to be fun. Now it's not.
"Amazing story, VA, and animations. More Rank ups and side story stuff like the interludes would be nice. would be amazing if re:lights and older events, Along with event banners made come backs between waiting period months for veteran players. New players would probably buy more for SQ if taxes didn't jump up. But bringing back older events and their banners might help. For replaying events instead of SQ and Lore it could be Mana prisms/Origin. Or respectively MP/rare Prism."
"Overall, the game has great graphics and the events keep you very entertained. The only issue that i have with this game that it doesnt have a link to save your progress like a google linking system or icloud system."
So many waifus to collect!!!! ‚ù§
Pity system when?
Thicc girls
Fun to play but they need to have a better way to transfer from one device to another instead of having to start all over every time.
I've been playing the game for weeks but suddenly the game won't launch at all i keep clearing cache and restarting the game but nothing seems to solve it.
Having a great time playing and long as everything stays fun I'll keep having fun. Do wish we got summon tickets as logins more often but thats just me.
Fun and enjoyable
"It's a great game, the gacha is a nightmare cause there is no guarantee but the game is fun nonetheless and you can progress with just 1-3* servant. It's just really unfortunate that a lot of materials for servants are dropped from story locked higher levels, moreover a lot of free materials that'd greatly help with ascending your servants, are on events that are locked for players who hasn't finished the main story arc, and believe me ‚Äî it's hard, especially if your servants are underleveled."
Everyone who plays this game is a sigma.
"I love this game a lot, but after losing my accouny twice, I'm done. My latest account I had spent at least 300$ on, and because my phone died, I lost all of it, and they won't reply to my emails trying to recover it. Why the hell anyone would spend money on a game with such poor backup mechanics and lousy customer service is beyond me. I would not reccomend this game to anyone."
"Great game with incredible stories. Plenty of great characters to collect, however there is no pity system for the gacha and the rates are relatively low. Definitely give it a try if you have not played the game before."
"Amazing game, great story!"
Sex at bond 15 when?
"If you don't want to pay money and you don't care about the story I suggest a different gacha game. The rates are absolutely abysmal there are many people that have spent thousands of dollars on this game just to get characters they want. It took me about 3-4 hours just to pass the first singularity, to unlock all the basic menu stuff that most games will give you in like 3 levels."
great game and i glad you guys brang this to chromebook too
Great game totally ruined my life
"Normally I don't rate games as if I'm happy or not really interested, I'll just continue to play or remove the game. I really do like FGO, it's story, the characters, especially the events in the time I've played since November 2018, but customer support has been less than ideal as I provided the needed info and also showed pics of receipts from quartz I've bought in trying to get my account back, but nothing worked. I'd say it's a 5 but CS is just not that helpful."
Get call greedy for wanting a pity system. Nice.
Advertises to me
"Aside from the gacha this game is so fun The events are rewarding,the story is pristine,the characters and just everything is just beautiful,it feels so nostalgic like from a time that is so familiar yet you can't remember. Now to the gacha it's not that bad. In gacha games the real enemy is not the gacha but your mind itself. You will constantly feel that you need this CE or servant to do this quest or just in general like the servant but because of gacha you can't get it."
can't you play the freaking game and and it takes too long to download I don't have time for it to download FIX IT PLEASE
I been playing this for 2 month now and I love it but pls gave me a artoria Pendragon lancer I'm crying but. must play this game take out your stress or to pass the time just relax and play it
Good game BUT IMPLEMENT AN ACCOUNT SAVER LIKE GOOGLE PLAY OT SOMETHING Its stupid to have to save this code onto your phone for it to be transfered ONCE so now thanks to that I just lost my entire account which to get the 5 star event characters wasnt so easy
I hope u guys fix it. Cause I love the anime.
"Awesome, i would honestly love it if you guys developed a MOBA style game with the servants. I feel like it would play off very well. Idk though."
"It has a great story absolutely, and while the gameplay itself is basic, it still fun because the animations are generally very satisfying. My greatest problem however, are the low rates for rare servants coupled with no pity system, you can really be left hopeless, so be VERY careful how you spend your money. I really wish i could give this a 5 star, but that gatcha really is hell sometimes."
collect waifu
the game is really good but I lost my phone and all my data so sad if anyway to recover that let me know so I don't want to start from 0 hell no is happens once but not again Please Fix That soon
185 quartz worth in rolls and i get 1 4* servant... assassin emiya... why
This game sucs
Great story with awesome characters from the show and fun events.
You know why.
I want to die
Rate up is a lie!!!
"really good gameplay, but the pull rates on limited servants is pretty low. thankfully the lower rarity servants are pretty good and you can clear almost all content in the game with them, but it becomes almost trivial when you have the rarer servants"
12 qu·∫∑c ra m·∫ª game r·∫•t hay
"I love this game, graphics are amazing and game runs really well"
"So... My daily login reseted for some reason I was supposed to get 50 quartz ended up losing all of the quartz I saved up for no reason, they just disappeared from my account, and the game logged me out and I have no way of getting my account back, overall a game poorly made and an app that s even worse runs very poorly, lots of bugs, lags and overall something that will consume a big amount of your time that you could use to play an actual decent gacha game like genshin."
Too much grind. Too little reward. Too addicted to talk back.
This game deleted my data two time and I saved it on both Google and Facebook had about 5 epic Heroes on both account still got deleted say my data was corrupt and the only good thing about it is that I wasn't dumb enough to spend any money on it
Great game and story
"Love all the cute, sexy, hot, beautiful girls. Keep up the great work."
Fun.
They have such fun events.
"The story and gameplay is great, but in the gacha especially limited ones what I mostly get are rate ups for friendpoint and story gacha"
"Good game, has some f2p support, but is still a little p2w."
The game is great but it has one major flaw and that is the summoning/gacha system fgo has some of the lowest drop rates in any gacha game I've ever played fgo is one of the most predatory gacha games do to its really horrible summoning drop rates and some of the events are terrible the event I really hate is the servant fest event that event is one of my least favorite events in the game.
"Occasionally freezes on pixel 3, not a great experience. Otherwise fun and has many updates"
Great game play and story but no penguins melt after 600 saint quartz. I'm out.
This game is cool i love the anime too
Been playing this game for years and has me even more addicted to the Fate franchise. This right here is THE gacha game. I've put more time (and money) than other gacha games out there..
Amazing game for those who love nasuverse or typemoon stuff. Amazing story. Hope it continues for years.
Love the game but that's from a fan of the fate series bias. Gameplay is a bit dated doesn't mean it's not fun for those into that. Story picks up after chapter 4 and for the most part gets better and better with each new chapter. If the game had better pity system and improved rates I would give it a higher score. FGO is more for the fans in my opinion so harder to recommend.
Not what I was looking for
This is trash Jk I just told my self that I'll rate this one star if I didnt get a 5 star servant but I like this game dont get me wrong
"One of the video games with the best story that I have played, the details and character development can also be seen. The gameplay is also great, all of the characters has their own uses; despite the servant's rarity, all of them can be used even in a late game progress. The Noble Phantasm animation are good. The game requires time and dedication in order for you to reach and play most of the content. Extremely F2P. The only cons I know is the rate of the gacha, the rate up is a lie. Sometimes."
Gacha is really bad. Gameplay is too Grindy but the story is an EX+++ TIER
The game is fine if you start around the time of an event where you get a free 4 star servant but other than that the rate for a 4 or 5 star are low
rate up is a lie :p
"This is hell,and i happily walked into it"
"I couldn't log in into the game for months, it said that there was network connection errors but other games went fine. So i had to re-install the game several times, however, I could only access the game for a short time. This time when I re-installed and did the the data transfer, It said that the number was already in use??????????? I tried hard to finally get Arjuna, I love Nero so much but because of this bug, I couldn't make it in Nero's banner :) this pissed me off."
Pog
Redownload the game and lost everything didn't spend any money but I lost everything it put me back into the tutorial instead of loading the game up like normal
Not gonna lie I got this app strictly because another gacha game failed on me during a valentine event. Little did I know I'd drop mad money on this beautiful gem of a game. And the best part is the money I am in financial ruin and it all of profiting these mad lads into creating and funding more fate movies and anime for me to viciously consume like the proud sheep I am....so yeah its pretty fun.
GA GACHA WOOHOOO
"Its decent. Not that big of a fan of the game play, it's boring and really easy most of the time. The character designs are nice and I am a big fan of them. Not sure on rates and all that. It also causes big fights between my brothers so not a fan of that. Otherwise it's an alright game to waste time on."
No comments;)
The game needs a pity system already it's been out for 6 years and it's really pushing it
Fun but the drop rates tho
Accidently clicked Uninstall when trying to update it and now my save data is gone. I had a maxed out Arjuna and Cu Chulain to and was close to maxing Nero out. Safe to say after spending so many hours to lose it all I'm not installing this app again.
"It is a good game. However, what good is a good game if you can't play it? I play multiple games that update weekly and I have no issues connecting to any of them. My phone is fine, an up to date Motorola Edge+. But, no matter what I do, clear the cache, restart, whatever, this game will not load. I don't have time to waste on a game with loading issues. Uninstalling..."
Lol this game keeps saying that connection lost even though I have fast connection. Then after that it keep saying restart the game and won't open unless I clear the data. Too waste of time
"Got bored and haven't played for a week, sees fate update, I'm playing :D"

Need a better way to save your account
The gatchas terrible but i like it. Would recommend to anyone who would like to have a fun time while going broke getting servants very epic
"Gameplay is fun but the one major problem is the gacha, the rates can at times be horrendous and with no pity system it feels like you've wasted this precious quartz for absolutely nothing"
love this & jp version
Yes SEIBAA WANGY
WE NEED SAVE DATA!!!!! like a back up feature like sign in on Google or something it's not hard to do I've lost multiple accounts now and i can't recover it let us BACK UP OUR SAVES PLEASE!!!!!
Awesome gameplay awesome backrounds
I love the artstyle and gameplayüòç. I don't mind grinding to level up my characters because I always look forward to see what changes they have in each of their ascension. Wonderful story too. Keep up the good work‚ô•Ô∏è
Yikes.
"Still playing a few years in, which is the best promotional I can give. the story is fun, the artwork great, and it stays updating"
wod be better if this game can give me bk my account I paid 100 on it
Fix matchmaking in rank. I get teammates that go 0/4 laning phase and just braindead goes in teamfights. I always get paired up with teammates who dont even speak English.
Is good
It would be great to have a set amount of pulls for certain banners so you could get one random 4 star servant or craft essanse for free.
May your rolls be good.
"Love it Jalter,Jeanne D'Arc and Ereshkigal best girls"
Censored Emiya Alter and butchered Osakabehime's dialogue.
"This game is good, I am not the biggest fan of the story in fact it's actually my least favor but beyond that everything else great. characters are fun and iconic and events are fantastic, this games gotcha can be hit or miss sometimes but it usually gives you what you need instead of what you want... but the lack of auto Battle really hope the game back"
Game r·∫•t hay nh∆∞ng c≈©ng r·∫•t ch√°n (Ôø£„ÉòÔø£;)
Takes up a lot of space but its good
"Dont understand why there isnt Pity summons, this game would be way better if it had pity summons."
its fun but i wish there was a event that you can choose your character's backstory
A really good game for fans of the Typemoon multiverse. Even a casual gamer could build a great team of heroes given time.
Og Waifu fighting simulator with drifting.
Very Fun Game Little Hard And The Summon's Suck Cause It Take's So Long To Get Up SQ Then You Get Shafted If You Don't Have RnG On Your Side
"Fun, game, but slow grind."
There is alot of things that I can figure out plus to many fusion to many skill sets but I guess it's good the actual artist I'd one of the best
I enjoy the game alot play it everyday just wish I had more use of my command seals they go to waste alot just sitting there
"Pretty good game. Gacha rates are honestly terrible and the amounts of summons you get are too few. The good is that you don't need 5 stars. I have played this game for years and I had some pretty good luck and have around 20-30ish 5 stars yet I still use my 3 stars since when used right, they can be pretty good. Plus you can borrow 5 stars from other people too so you can use servants that you like without having to get them. Edit- Lost a star for too grindy events for a welfare 4 star."
Really fun game.
Very slow to start but fairly worth it
Suddenly unable to play game. Will say it has an update but its not in app store and told me if i uninstall and reinstall ill loss my data. Issue was fixed!
It's a really good app though it is a little glitchy at times
I like this app when it's not bugging out about the lastest update
Tbh this game is what it is
Take your time dont rush it's a great story gacha can be extreme sometimes but f2p is not that bad either
"Yeah, so, I think there may be an error or a bug or something, because it says the app is updated, but there was no update given, and if there was, it isnt responding to it. So now im kinda stuck in limbo. Please fix this asap"
"The game failed to give me a special unlockable summer clothing for a 5-star servant. And I told to the support fgo game personal and they didn't help me with the issue saying that ""there is no issue with the event game"". I feel that was unfair when I provided them the requirements and provide the evidence, but not get any help back. The game is amazing and great to play in. BUT, it disappointed me alot with not able to aquire what I wished."
If i don't get merlin then i'll come back for you
"A great game over all, but need to increase rate up for 3+ star servants, and also maybe add African servants, like Moses, for example."
"rate up is a lie, card games, bad low five star rates and bb banner is a scam. 10/10 never dropping the the game everybody should try it"
"The game is fun and addictive... Although the rates are a pain, it's its charm..."
This is a good game but there is a glitch where when u unlock saber from event it says tap the screen but when i did it didnt work
Its pretty good u can f2p but it will take longer to get more servants but the quest so far is the best
It's pretty good I would recommend it to non fate fans as well. :D
Story is good but the rate that they give out the summoning currency is a bit stingy for a gacha game. (1 year player with 5 SSR.)
Spend all my mone haha funni gaem
This is a very difficult game. Only play if you are a masochist. Rate up is a lie.
This game is amazing. .. that s all
Great characters. Interesting gameplay that rewards creative and strategic planning. Plus a great way to learn about legendary figures around the world.
"Freemium done right. The game is engaging and strategic without being overly complicated, and it doesn't feel like purchases are required in order to play."
"Some events are unaccessible unless you complete/reach certain chapters making it likely to permanetly miss contents. The drop rate are ridiculously and suspiciously low, even on rate up banners. Time consuming farming due to Lack of auto battle for completed missions. Lack of a real Pity system that's not exclusive to mega whales. Still i Love the story, soundtrack looks and characters. Though there's many problems that are quite anti-consumers, so far, i can't really let go despite that."
"After playing plenty of gacha games this is still the one that I find has the some of the best gameplay, which is both simple and immersive. However, the Emiya Alter censorship still rubs me the wrong way and I really can't recommend FGO to anyone unless you have enough self control to F2P, or you can suffer through the gacha without breaking the bank. If you're a Fate simp, this is definitely a game for you."
Gotta collect them all...then weep for you expunged wallet.
Great story and awesome characters. I've spent hundreds of hours on this game and it just keeps getting better and better.
Still NO Android 10 support!
"Aside such low rate to get 5* servant, the story and the characters in this game is epic and amazing, especially the last battle. I think there is no games like this as far as I remember. I would highly recommend the game if you want something with fantastic story to go along with."
summer musashi pls
Fun and very good atleast for me. Rate up is a lie though.
Best story in a mobile game ever!
I want to eat Alfredo off of okita souji's chest
"Do you like grinding the same fight 500 times a day, how about pulling Slot machine handle only to get a bunch of ma po tofu cards, this might be the game for you. Yes the story is good, the characters are mostly decent, however the ""rate up"" is a joke and you're still going to need at least 1 k quartz to maybe get the character you want..."
"Best waifu gacha game. Been playing this game since launch and its very f2p friendly, can clear the whole game content without depending too much on rarities and no paywall events. When in doubt just Wait and Hope."
"This is probably the only mobile game that has kept me playing for over a year and got me addicted enough to spend on. I always thought mobile games were terrible, but this one changed my mind. It's just a mix of the story, the gameplay/mechanics, and the characters. They all have their own addictive charm. Though it may be hard to get 5 stars, the game gives you enough free saint quartz to get a lot of servants. I love Fate and this game just makes me love the franchise even more."
Best game in the universe. I will give it a 10 star if I could.
I got the game to work on my phone again but it deleted all my saved data cab you help me get it back please thank you.
i wish updates would be avaliable faster i have to wait 2 hours for the update on the playstore while my friends can instantly download the update when its released
"even though my luck is absolutely garbage in this game, i love nasu's works and waver"
"I'm a fan of FSN series so i like this game a lot. Plus, a strategical card battle.. I also love the events in the game."
"Love the game, freezes a bit but not enough to annoy me"
Fun game. Summoning will sometimes stress you out. Story is great. Main downside is that it's like 90% farming after a while
Add a pity system so I don't have to make my wallet cry ty
Have fun!
"FOMO is a thing. Great storytelling, the only positive. An otherwise wholly outdated game."
Amazing Gameplay i might just start making videos about it starting from now and begin streaming it on my phone but all that aside it has stunning graphics very good for following the story line and very good 3D character Designs i encourage you all to play it it is very fun the start is slmewhat a drag but it picks up with the events üôèüòä
It's a good game and I've got Skadi.
"Great, entertaining."
Lol
well. i guess my previous review got deleted. my stance doesn't change. this game is fun. combined with personalities. yes. its fun. this is probably my favorite game to play.
10/10 would go to hell again. Now DW give me quarts
Gacha hell at it's finest
"It's nice to see your favourite characters and the gameplay Itself is fine. Ui and menu are heavily outdated, the game is too grindy and not very generous short term If you like fate, give this game a try; if you don't, just skip it"
My data transfer code isnt working
It is just like the move$
This may sound dumb but may I ask? Is taking screenshots of the game and sending it to my friends a violation of ToS or copyright? Thanks... I have religious OCD that's why i ask this... Thanks in advance!
too many bugs
really great and addicting game
Need more rate up :_)
"After the latest update many character has an issue with their sound especially when we do a 3 card combo with different type cards. So far for me it is summer jalter, skadi, and ishtar that has this issue. The character voice become like laggy and really annoying to hear. Would be great if you guys can fix it before the newest summer banner"
"Honestly considering how people trade up, break,lose,destroy etc their phones, a lack of a way to back up the game really pisses me off. I had to start over from scratch twice. I really don't want to do it again. I'll probably wait till another anniversary event happens ( anniversary event means crapton of freebies + easy to complete rewards +previous rewards comeback maybe= great restarting point.) Still is it really that hard to have a Facebook or Google to save progress???"
the loading time bruh
i'd give more stars if I could

The game's pretty great but the summoning rate is so low on getting servants and I love the animation of the ultimate moves and the art for the characters is amazing when you finally max your servants to their final look-|-Can you guys allow us to have our accounts saved by having it linked with Google play just in case the game won't want open or not having enough space to update the game
I have drowned myself in what I know as the waifu hell where all I ever know anymore is fate doujins and spending money on jpegs
Mmm astolfo
"Terrible gacha rates, be prepared to spend a lot of money or deal with having trash characters."
Fate sepramcy
You can learn about historical characters by playing this game and the artwork is beautiful.
Mash best
Worst drop rates ever the game will let you spend potentially hundreds of dollars and you won't even get a single copy of the character your after hell you may not even get a 5 star it claims the drop rates are boosted for some of the banner characters but I guess when the drop rate is 0 percent it doesn't matter don't let this game screw you over like it did me its horrible
"Don't even waste your time with this game. This company is ridiculously greedy, if you try their gacha you'll be more than depressed, there are videos of people raging on this games gacha. This needs a pity mode. Until then I'm done giving this game my time. Sure the story is ok, but thats it. Nothing else is going for it. If you want an event characters too bad unless you're willing to spend thousands of dollars or have insane luck, you won't ever see them. If you care about your sanity run."
"Its a good game, maybe the gameplay is not good as other games but the story is great and enjoyable. I actually like the character design in this game, the va too. The only problem is you cant bind your account with google play etc, you can only use bind code in this game which is basically i can lost my account easly if i forgot to bind the code."
"Come and stay for excellent story and characters (Ereshkigal is my favorite). Do not expect to get mountains of free currency and high rarity units or you will be severely disappointed. Gameplay is interesting enough with turn based card battle system. I personally love this game to death but it's not for everyone. Pros: Excellent story, constant events, great character depth and diversity, nice character art by many different artists Cons: horrible gacha rates, no pity system, no auto battle"
"This game is actually very awesome if you watch the anime it's kinda rushing it but I like it,it goes through every detail on the anime and it's pretty good but I have a complain cuz as you can see it's online but on merely the hole game is offline except on the support character choice thingy and the summon cuz we gamers can handle it we just play online when our gems (I forgot what was it called while writing this) that can use for summon is up so thats just it hope this review doesn't ignored"
Gacha rates are bad. No pity system. 5 stars
Depending on your roll this can be a good or bad game I got lucky so its a 5 star for me
It keeps saying connecting even though I have a fast WiFi
Broken banners!! Never give even one good character off the new banner!!!
Game is trash. Don't recommend it to anyone.
This game has gotten me addicted to this whole gacha thing. And I NEED MORE!!!!
"Hey, BB summer rate up is suck. Already pulling 80x not even getting 4* or 5* servant. Worse banner!"
I enjoyed this game...The problem is you should make bind system......not the transfer code.....I already lost my accountüò≠Please solve this problem for us.
Got my waifu me happy
"this game is good, tho this is a gacha they still give awesome rewards and some summoning accessible to casual players. but still can't complete some events cuz it's hard to grind and lvl up without using money."
If your lucky than its fine but if not don't even bother you can spend 500+ and get nothing.
"I cant open all the versions, I mean all of it. My wifi is good it's not slow, I even do speed test couple of times, play a game, download a game to check the signal itself yet why I can't play this? This ruin my game especially it Happened during an event! If this problem dont get fix tomorrow I'm out on this"
Started of great but after my first week the game cheated me out of my 7 day login reward and 50 Sq which is a little frustrating. I hooe thisbdoesnt continue
"Been playing for almost 2 years, everything is top notch from the characters, story and events, literally everything you'd want in a gacha game is in here, except the rates... I'm mostly fp2, I only spend money gssrs (basically a guaranteed ssr banner and is only summonable with paid currency) and I'm doing really good and having fun. TLDR: it's a really good game but don't expect to a lot of good units from the start, just try to save your quartz for the units you REALLY want and have fun!"
Horrible rates and the game is really slow
The rate-up is a lie
Fun game but servant drop rates are terrible
I will not change mash as my number one servant
RoR Good Fate bad
I feel like I am going to rest in peace when I saw ENG translation after a year of doing silly things in JAP.
"I both love and hate this game... I love cuz i addicted and hate cuz the drop rate gacha, QP, materials and SQ are hell. I just want SSR servant... Pleaseüôè"
Goetia when?
"Love this game, also a fan of fate series.. but there only one problem for me.. it's really hard for me to get my favourite servant... The gameplay, the graphic I love it... My only problem is getting my favourite servant, hopefully I can free and choose 1 of my favourite servant... Edit: I think this game hate me üòÖ"
"I Love the game, I just wish rates were better on it. I did a saint draw ten times and only managed to get one 4 star hero. You should seperate the cards from the heroic spirits."
"Good at the start but i losed all my motivation playing the game after spending 300dia at the gacha. Please raise a bit the drop rate % i keep getting 3‚òÜ and it's make me want to break some tables ""I really like the game just do something about the % and i will shut up nyahah"""
The default gacha game for us no lifers
Enjoy yourself playing this but rate up is a lie
Very fun time sink. Takes a while to get into it. But it's very enjoyable!
When is indonesian/asia server release.
Happy
I have played this and it is not fun (for me)
Amazing!
"Been playing for almost 3 years and all I can say is I'll probably play this game until it dies. Gacha rates may be bad, but as a f2p there are a huge amount you can do with 3 stars and below that you can still clear the harder content later on."
I'm a fate fan and I love this game
Great love the game fun and interesting
Bad rates don't waste money on this
I dont have any contAct info with this phone except when on wifi
really expensive when you want characters
"Fun, fantastic, and it is great too meet so many legendary figures and befriend them."
Nword
Bisiklatin ang pepe
Bisaklatin mo na ang pehpeh Wala ng birhen ngayon boi
Godjuna very strong yes
"3 years of endless grinding, still at 19 SSRs. Best game indeed"
Still no NP skip.
"it is fun, but chances of getting a five star in the summoning gatcha is very low (0.001% most times) but you don't necassarily need 5star since there is the support from a friend option. Anyway, its really fun and I enjoy it thoroughly and recommend it highly~"
Just the fairy knight gawain that is all.
"The game itself is fun, the graphics are great and the story line is quite a challenge. I personally think the hardest thing about this game is the character drop rate, it's so low you could be waiting several months just to get a 5 star charcter."
Hi yes been playing this game for a while it's great got the characters I wanted but I ran into a issue on opening the app all I'm getting is a black screen just that I tried all of the methods to fix and they haven't work
"I LOVE IT, ITS REALLY GOOD,"
"Seriously, after bringing down the rating, the update button shows up! Jizuz.. and I tried reloading multiple times. O well here's the 5 star then..."
"The saint quart's..... They slowly take over, someone help, I'm slowly spiraling into madness! Oh look, a five start servant!"
Fun I guess
"As a huge fate fan, I absolutely love the app. Could use some improvements, but overall I'm satisfied"
Awesome game been playing it for awhile nowüëç
It's terrible.
Awesome story. I hate these kind of gameplays but this is an exception.
Decent time if your fate fan little bit grindy but you'll get what you need to out of it over time
"Fun game, decent amount of strategy involved. Lots of character variety, great art style and animation. Prices are a little steep on the currency though, so buy responsibly."
Accidentally deleted the game and lost my account FOREVER. The game is still played by many players today but backing up information by binding the game account to an email is still not implemented. You try contacting the support to ask for other ways to help in retrieving the account but the support just sends templated replies and doesn't even show an ounce of sympathy with the player.
App goes down all the time and constantly says wrong version but there's no update available.
The game is good it's just that the glitches and slowness is annoying.
I love it especially 1rst hassan and altria alter (saber)
Good story and gameplay but man the grinding is too much please add some way to make grinding easy with some form of skip ticket take princess connect and their skip ticket system
"Absolutely love the game, especially the story and the new Servants you can get but what I don't like is how sometimes you can't be able to update the game when the new update comes out"
I love going through the storyline and seeing seeing all the different battles and cuts scenes but I'm it is but I'm more like summoning the character being the character that I can battle with and forming a bond with and forming a bond with them because some of them are really cute
"I find the gameplay, story, and character interactions enjoyable; my only gripe with the game would be how insanely difficult it it is to pull some of the higher rarity characters, but this is a gacha game so I guess that's to be expected"
Fate / Grand Order is a game based on the anime series that pits an organization called chaldea against alternate realities that they must alter in order to save the world. The game has a remarkable story and a well presented art. But what is a game without its amazing characters and history. In FATE / GRAND ORDER the characters follow real and mythical heroes from our reality with a twist for charismatic and a bit of spice. The game is very well made and is addictive. It also features GATCHA.
Really fun and love the characters
"I have Gramps, Artoria, and Nobu......I'm only missing my precious Captain Drake."
"It is a fun game. Though sometimes the screen ""sticks* sometimes even the internet is working fine here."
"Pretty great game, story, characters, and gameplay. The only drawback is how rare 5 stars are. 0.12% in many cases, kinda absurd in my opinion."
Can u kindly increase servant rates? :(
As a Avid FAN of the Fate Series! This is a must game to have!
"This is a great game to all Gacha players out there, but always remember. Once you are in, you are in."
Thank you so much my concern regarding account transfer has been resolved quickly! I get to play again and picked up where I left off.
"It's alright. Fills time in a slow work day, but I wouldn't call it a game to stick by."
Great.
Gacha was a mistake
The gacha here is the worst I've seen in years. Other than that the game's pretty good.
"Didn't think id be playing a mobile game every day again, got me deep into the fate lore like fantasy football got me deep into football sheesh"
It is a super fun and addictive game with nice simple but deep combat
GIVE ME SOME 5 STAR SERVANTS PLES
I've enjoyed the game from day 1. King Hassan is best girl
I used to loved this game but when i change my phone I cant play anymore and cant get my account
Gameplay is simple but that's fine since the story is on a whole different level. Playing this feels like I'm watching an Anime. Been enjoying it so far despite being a Free 2 Play player
Somehow still playing it
"This game lies about event timing, wastes your time and steals your money. Could be a lot better for how popular it is. They really need to borrow some ideas from Epic Seven. Particularly the animated character art and Lobby/menu screen, guaranteed summon, etc. Also, Drop Rate Up is a lie."
Would be nice if i can use my Google or fb as a log in method cause i lost my acc couldn't get back
Such amazing game you deserved my 5 stars
This is rather expensive game for the 2021 If you want to be collector prepare to pay at least 300+ USD every event. 2 event a month to grt SSR. I only play because i love the fate universe
I've played this far longer than I should have I think
"All in all this is a very good game, excellent in fact. There's lots of combination to use, rosters to form and so far, the events are godly (free stuffs everywhere) so yeah I'll keep playing the game, thank you."
I've never given the fate series much thought before I played this game. I'm such a huge fan of the series now. I've been playing this game since a few months after it was released. I fell in love with the story and the characters. I can't wait for what the future holds for this game!!
Lot of fun on playing the game
Haha wallet go brrr.
"Amazing game, absurd free to play, Even their low rarity units can match their SSR units in soem situations with the right setup."
It's fun but not f2p friendly
Overall good so gimme my Merlin edit: I got Merlin last December 2018 thank you dw
"very grindy game, but very rewarding during the events. great story to play through and tons of events to enjoy rewards from. the summer event just started so if you're new i highly suggest playing now of all times."
this game is literal hell
"Overall it's good for what it is, but I can't help but feel that there should be more lower tier sabers so that the class is actually available to all players regardless of how much or little money they can put into the game. If this can be addressed then I see no reason to not give this game a full five stars. edit: drop rates have seemingly improved so here's an extra star."
Best Game Ever üíØ
"Extremely predatory banners and pay to win. 3 stars because the gameplay, animations, graphics are nice. As well the story but the rates are terrible. I know you can play without gacha but what's the point in playing if you won't summon?"
Great servants and a better rate of gacha
Where is he
Should have been a 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that your game is bugged even with wifi I cannot connect then afterI reinstalled the game all my progress were gone. 3 years of progress gone...................
Story is 10/10
"Worst gacha hell ever , would recomend 10/10"
It is fun to play when you are a fan of the show
Really addictive
If you want another low quality game to throw money at this is perfect. The drop rates on even a regular character are so abysmally low i only have about 6 and thats after months of playing for free
"This was my first ever Gacha game I played. I've started to play a lot of other gacha games after this and it made me realize how disheartening this games gacha pulls can be in comparison. I still keep on playing this game though cause of its rich stories, its characters, and frequent events."
Love the gameüëå fun when you have time to kill lot of characters to choose fromüëçüëçüëç
Worst gacha rates out of any other game.
"Too many loading times, multiple loading crashes"
garbage do not download this game.
Just putting this out there that there's no pity system the fact the game will let you spend hundreds of dollars without garunteeing even a non limited ssr is scummy. Wouldn't recommend picking this one up
"F/GO is a pretty decent game. The story is amazing, especially if you know the historical characters and understand their interactions, being a fate fan before playing this game also made it more enjoyable. HOWEVER, the pulling rates for Five Star Servants are god awful, no pity system either. If they spinning rates were improved in some way the game would be so much better..."
Schedule maintenance right before an event ends. They then correct the time to end the event before maintenance but didn't advertise maintenance or extend event after maintenance cutting over 8hours from people. Poor management on North America. 20k down the drain
Lost my account because the developers weren't smart enough to have accounts linked to Google play but the phone being used instead. If I could give negative stars I would.
"I love the game but there is this new bug where nothing is loading, it takes forever to get to any screen, it's getting really annoying"
good civilization
This game is so BORING!!!!! Close to impossible to get SSR servants unless you top up at least a million dollars. No pity summon system. 1 quartz equals to a dollars so you need to have 30 dollars for a 10 summon. Too greedy for a game. Until now still no pity summon system.
Anime waifus. Solid story. Play it.
"It was a great game with a actual sense of humor, unlike a lot of games now. The only real problem are the rates, you could have tens or maybe even hundreds of rolls and not get the character you desire."
Trash and you fight chairs
"Putting aside the horrible rates of the gacha, the game is just horribly boring now. It's always the same kind of battles over and over, the way most events work are pretty much the same with the only new things being the story. I really wish that there can be a wider variety of battle modes rather than just tap and attack all the time. But then again, the EN version follows the JP version so why am I even feedbacking here. Not that the multimillionaire company will listen."
"I've played this game since the it's launch in the USA and followed it for a while before hand. I can safely say that this is my favorite RPG on mobile. I LOVE the character designs and Noble Phantasm animations. EDIT: Seeing as we now have the QOL updates the JP has access to now, I have changed my review score. 5/5 Stars"
It has ryougi shiki
"I real love this game the story was good, but there's something i want devs a Filipino heroic spirit"
"App didn't start correctly clear cache, cannot connect to game server loop"
"Well in my own personal opinion, I think it's very entertaining in it's own way and it has a fascinating story that merge well with characters. For starters, it is fun to play with gacha and hoping for 4 üåü servant"
Have not yet played. But it looks good!
Hans is the best
From 2 star to one star. The game is boring the gacha is too unfair. You needed points to summon servants you cant even summon two 4star servants. The cards ruin the game
"Been playing since 2018, it has been a long run. I enjoyed it. But I think 2021 is not my year, it's mid year now and still no new SSR for me. I never ever ever got to celebrate this game's anniversary, I saved up too many quartz and it ends up all the same, nothing but CEs. I saved up mats, QPs, Lores and quartz for possible new SSRs but still nothing...so I ended up feeding all of these mats, lores and QPs to my lower rarity servants. This is really hell. To anyone, download at your own risk.."
bruh just fix this time's bug dude. always connection lost is just annoying. nice game anyway just need fix this bug after update and all is perfect again
Hmmmm Nice game but My other account can't log in again using the code transfer
A single missed login and you lose ALL access to the anniversary rewards. Guess you're not allowed to play this game if you have a life. I regret giving them any money and never will again.
One of the worst Rates to pull for Gacha. No pity and very outdated game. I did have fun but mostly thanks to community. Easy to lose your account. One time password system. The character design are great but it very grindy.
Perfecto
"Been a fan for 2 years, it keeps getting better and better."
I got very enjoyed it well because my favourite type of game is anime and i want to this game is give a 5 star!!! ( „Åä„ÇÅ„Åß„Å®„ÅÜ!! )
"Fun, enjoyable, lovable characters, still read the original Fate Visual Novels if you can. There is a learning curve but worth the effort."
I cannot use saint quartz because they're free and I can only use the paid ones? This is predatory and a scam.
"until account recovery/transfer is better than a password system reminiscent of the godamn NES era, i will not touch this game again. Upon revisit, and after playing many other gacha games, i have realized this is one of the worst gacha games on the market. Only reason it isnt dead is the fate brand is strong."
"This game is nice but I hope the ""drop rate up"" is LEGIT. When I summon, I have nothing. Pls have a pity system."
H a h a . . H a
I change my mind this sucks when it comes to chances to get a 4 star and a 5 star the summons suck and rate up is a lie.
Always getting connection lost to the game server
Good game tip if your new read the instructions
It is a good game
This games very very very unf2p friendly and the pacings garbage
The app is amazing but the latest update broke my game
"I spent 90 SQs and i didn't even get a single 4 or 5 star servant, the gotcha system in this game is soo bad, I'm moving to genshin, atleast there's a really good chance in genshin, unlike this game"
Fun game but i having a bad luck here
"Story is really good but the gameplay is boring after a while. Rate up for servants is kinda whatever since they run events where you can get decent 4star servants for free, but I dislike how long it takes to get basic materials and how much you have to run the same basic quests they've had for years now just for regular upgrades. The event rewards are worth it tho and kinda offsets this problem."
"It's a pretty fun game with some great story and fun characters, but definitely needs a lot of time and dedication to progress. If you don't mind item farming and grinding, definitely worth looking into. They've got great support and help desks, just make sure to write down your game information just in case. I just wish the friends list wasn't limited to whichever language you play in."
"Fantastic game with lots of content and new events quite often. Lots of grinding however so if your time constraint like me good luck. The 5* servant rates are tuff but with proper planning you'll be just fine, and keep in mind that even lower star servants can be great. Im mostly f2p but I have a lot of time played almost 1000 login days so I can honestly say this is a fantastic game, especially if you love the anime."
The game is very fun and the graphics are very godtier
"This game is very fun, story wise is kinda interesting, but problems such as ""I cant defeat this boss cuz im f2p"" is a big problem, and in the start, the story is kinda boring, so most of the new players ain't gonna get hooked by it, so they just play a little and leave or delete the game"
Very Good Game That I Can't Stop Playing ü§ó
"Game is still trash, after all this time. Nothings changed."
Best gacha game of all time! üî• 10/10 story! üíØ I love Maid Alter and all the Saberfaces! ‚ù§
The story is brilliantly done the characters are fun an the gameplay is fun but might not be up to most people speed i recommend you try it for the story an the servants you summon after all every servant is helpful based off stragety you use
Love the game great challenge only problem I have is the pull rates Wich I feel could be lowered so your not constantly sinking money into the game just to not get the catds you want and constantly getting craft essences instead of characters.
Skeet skeets for real man played for ages n just gtn back into again. Love the game
u need pity system
Easy to play and a great story make this game a slam dunk
"Great story, great gameplay amd good drop rates"
"Really had fun playing this game except Everytime Im always broke, but still learned some history behind these characters here"
I literally can't play anymore the game says it needs to update doesn't even have that option.
"Yo what the hell is wrong with your servers.... I can't enter the game now and it's stuck on ""Game server in busy"".... What the hell is this"
"2021: No binding mail, social acc. No autofarm, no ticket, no skip. Very very outdated gameplay. Gacha rate is the worst, no guarantee. No replayable story quest, boss fight,.. etc. Events are less and less interesting, not newbie friendly anymore (which require Solomon arc to play). Servants are just copy and paste skills then adjust it. IAP is boring as hell. Good story, music can't save this game. At least for me."
"The customer support is awesome, I accidentally deleted my game a few days ago and they helped me recover my account before I lost my login streak. That alone is worth a 5 star rating in my opinion. Results may vary, but in my particular case, they came through big time."
Gacha Hell at its finest. Tamamo already home! orz Can't wait for Tamamo Viici ... \('-')/
"Rate up is the standard of bad, lol. But the characters and story are solid. A must for any FATE fan."
Only problem with the game is that it has the worst gacha out of any game I've ever seen
I love playing the game since it's basically a waifu/husbando simulator but I have one problem or a technical something happened to me. I bought the 18 pack saint quartz for the new GSSR banner and I only received 12 quartz and not the extra 6 quartz. Is it wrong? Or something? Can you contact me or let me know of it's a technical error on your end or something I don't know?
"I have to say this game is good, but not great. The story is on point, I love the art and NP animations, but there are a couple issues. The cutscenes are aggressively long at times and the different chapters start to drag. The work to try and level up characters takes a long time too, it started to feel like the materials barely did anything. Summon rates are abysmal as well, low drop rates on Servants, even lower on 5* with no pity system and no effective way to get the currency except paying."
Summon rate kinda sucks + no pity
"Cutting the event time just like that, that's how the developer treat us. This is ridiculously unprofessional. I don't care about your apologies on twitter, for a mistake like this to happen and you solve it only with a ""sincere apologies"" on twitter WHAT A BIG SHAME"
My code is not being accepted.
5 stars because I like Fate
"Everything on this game is Low. Low gacha rates, Low item drop rates and the requirements is freaking high compared to other games."
Amazing character designs good storyline the events are nice overall just great
"EDIT: -1 Star for sudden maintenance DURING time-limited event costing me servant copies/mats. Comedy, tragedy, mystery, the writing and characters are superb. Interesting without being overcomplicated. The currency, material drop rates, and gatcha are generous enough that spending money is tempting when you REALLY want a particular character, but doesn't feel at all forced to have fun and advance through the story. Build and experiment with a wide variety of team comps, combos, and strategies."
Ampas
Gacha is hell.
This game makes me dank...
"Being a fan of TypeMoon definetly helps with adoring this game. Its incredible! It tells full Manga Arc style storlines that are referenced in nearly every progressive story. For the negative I hope they seperate the summon system out for Saint Quarts summons into Craft Essence and Servants respectively. With the current drop rates, you spend a lot of quarts on redundant or repetitive craft items and very rarely a servant of note. Thank you Dev Team for helping me recover my lost account!"
willing to spend my time on this
As a long time Fate fan this game is great. Lots of good art and tons of characters with fun writing.
Gold mine or black hole depends on who is playing
Thats hell your walking into
"Love the servants, getting addicted to their gacha system lmao"
"lied in game about event end time causing me to lose most of the whole point of event after spending time. If event is extended due to maintanance and this issue, will fix rating."
Incredible game I hope it keeps improving
Great game but I can't play it's say something but its a good game so far
It's fun and I enjoy it. The gacha system sucks balls but doesnt make the game unplayable like others. You can easily have fun with the easier to get characters.
Ain't got much to do when there's no event
Give me SSRs bruh
Nobu give me
Its fun but can get really boring really fast
This is the best anime game i have played with story plot. I want to play more RPG games like this. I will be much appreciated if i get to play more fate games just like this one with new story plot and new servents too.... I am currently at Psuedo singularity 1st and i am excited to play more
"Like every other review says. If you want to have fun, dont play this. There technically is no gameplay The story is an absolute drag that you would skip 92% of each singularity. The only way you can find fun in this game is if you're interested in Fate as a whole. If you're a Fate fan, then you should at least consider playing it. The servants makes it interesting. MOSTLY THEIR LORE AND DIALOGUES! YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND A WAIFU YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY IN YOUR BANK AC"
Dont listen to the ppl complaining about the rates like 90% of units are usable even the freind point servants are mostly good and the story is worth taking the time to play through DONT SKIP IT!!!!! Also ssr rate is 1% 0.7 for the featured ssr so ifya dont get a banner units when pulling a 5* servant thats yer bad luck also good luck in ur gacha hell
"I love fate series and this game but my storage is small, im gonna buy a phone that can store Atleast 6.5gb for Fate/GO, the game is based on Historical , Myths, Legends but remember its only a fiction, it has nothing to do with real life, it is also a Gacha game but the fair part is, that u can use any characters even if its not 5 star, it can par it with 5 star characters, like Ushiwakamaru, her Noble Phantasm is strong even if shes only a 3 star Rider. Try this game if u saw my message."
"Just play it, you'll like it in a way. If not then ok."
Willing to spend 100$ for Ereshkigal banner when she got a NP upgrade
"Unfair, some events has very difficult quest that are impossible to beat especially if you're a new player and of course you don't have good servants to use. They are doing this to force new players to purchase in-app items to upgrade your servants and CE. How about F2P players? This game is not for everyone."
Would be better if the gacha system was more forgiving. Less than 1% chance for a 5 star servant. You are more likely to get a 4 or 5 star crafting essence than you are to get a 4 star servant. Would be better if the crafting essences and the servants were in different draw pools.
Love anime and game is same!
It was Fun
I need help my game keeps telling me I have no internet connection and to retry the connection or restart the application and I have done both still didn't work I also tried to uninstall and reinstall and it still didn't work I need help here please
"Really is a great game and i don't mind the rates cuz i think its fair enough since most units are op and even with low chances I got something useful even though its a spook. Seriously this is not a waifu or husbando sim ,its main attraction is the Great story and historical figures that was combined to make it epic. Amd btw I'm a F2P player who never spend but already passed all singularity and current lostbelts cuz its not really hard to play it due to op servants even a 1 star to 3 stars."
This is starting to piss me off every time I delete this game to make space I can't log in using the same phone when I install it again
"It's too archaic. You only play this game because you love Fate. That's all. The gacha sucks, the gameplay sucks, and the gacha sucks."
Where is Facebook or Google to save you game account ( I don't see it )üëéüèæ Delete this game
This game is amazing
extremely predatory gacha
Jpegs make me smile:)
Neat!!!!!
"This is one of the best games I've ever played. It is simple to get into, but there's so much depth when you start to look into things more. The story is fantastic! It's long, well thought out, with returning and new characters. The team building is a big aspect of this game if you aren't a fan of that, or turn-based RPGs, this may not be for you. But if you like them, and the fate series, there's no better game for a fan imo! Summoning rates are rather low though it is f2p friendly, be wary."
Terrible gacha system and the gameplay is boring.
"A nice turn-based game to kill some time with, even if you're F2P. The later part of the game does have quite a difficulty spike though, so be prepared for that. My main complaint is how it lacks a proper ""pity"" system, which apparently most gacha games have (like Genshin Impact). Once you clear most of the available battles though, the amount of summons you'll be able to do is laughable if you're F2P. The game is far too stingy with its SQ, & why I quit playing."
Bad gacha no life
Honestly I'd only like how you have to keep the same code to make an account transfer but overall the he is pretty good
Only one word to describe the gacha system is CE CE CE. You sure love your CEs
"addicting but not too friendly to free players. Also a pain to get good servants without dishing out money. Story is great, overall a good game. just waiting for the Okeanos update."
"On one hand fgo has great animations and story, keeps you engaged and its overall a good game. On the other hand, the rates are pretty punishing and the game is a little newbie unfriendly in the sense that old event ces and servants dont come back so new players that missed them will never get them. I wish for the game to rerun the very old events or at least add new event ces with the same effects as those old ones."

Got most my SSRs with 1 ticket yolos
"The game isn't perfect, what with the extremely low gacha rates, but the gameplay, story and graphics are very good."
I love this game but the maker's of the game need to make the characters speak English.
burh
Try to catch up with JP and have hetter rng pls
Heckin yessums
"I really enjoy the anime series, so seeing as there was a game about it, albeit a mobile one I immediately downloaded it. For my first gacha game, it was surprisingly fun with the game mechanics and story. It's also a gacha game, so be very careful to not lose yourself in trying to summon for your waifus or husbandos."
I like the game.
Got Heracles ony first reroll
10/10 gacha hell. Would roll again.
"I've played this game for a bit of time now , my only problem is the lazyness in the first 4/5 singularlys and I wish there were more in-depth imagines to see during the story in these singularlys. Overall rating 8.5/10 . The game has some problems but the game overall is nice , shame it's not in the EU. IF YOU HAVE A GAMBLING ADDICTION DONT PLAY THIS GAME ."
"Story is good, Characters are cool, game play is awful. If it wasn't the Fate IP it'd of died along time ago unfortunately."
"I don't mind farming, story is good but horrible gacha rate"
Awesome game i would recommend it
Stupid gacha rates. But cool story tho
Would love to keep playing but uninstaled then reinstaled without knowing you cant get your account back and dont wanna start from square one again
The game it self is okay medicore at best...but those damn summonings are horrible I know it's a gacha game and all but it's more like a gambling simulator..saved up 100 saint quartz( no actual money spent thank God) and tried the group summoning for the demon king....all I got was four star essences and some three star servant's then noticed that the demon king has a less than 1% chance of getting summoned...yeah I'm done with this game and I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
I only play this game because of Astolfo
Your game suck as balls
Its hell you are walking into
Best game I played ;)
Masaya at malinamnam Sq ay masarap ipalaman sa tinapay sarap! Wow penge naman ng pulutan jan sabi ni berserker hahaha lol pero tangina niya daw sabi ni merlin tas si fou tumahol fou fou foukingina mo merlin WRAAAGHHH isang KRAZZIIEE NA ASO SI FOU!!! ASKDKAKSKSJ
THE BEST
I hate how I'm addicted to this game
Events only being timed limited and have no way to play when you want and be timed gated then have to wait years for some events to return is madness and there's no mercy system in place to try and help you get the charcters you want from summons the rates are insane *low but it has strong plot points and is fun in burst of play and can itch the craving for fate content as the anime has been lacking and has very funny moments and references if you keep an eye out
"great game, facinating story, fun interactions between servants but if i were to have one complain is that this game NEEDS an auto button or at the very least a resource you can use to complete a quest you've already cleared once. the ammount of time you waste farming eclipses everything else, while yes you can make ideal farm set ups youl still speed a good 15 -30 mins farming for stuff like embers or QP. becomes very tedious at times after repeating the same things 12 times in a row"
People who don't like this game are just scrubs in my opinion Hahahaha.

It has a great story
"Drop rate is getting worst. Wasted most of the sqs + tickets that I saved since last year, and what did it gave me? Duplicate CEs. üôÑ"
Failed Review
Good story
Hate this game it takes all my money
Its amazing you can summon servants and unlock forms and noble fantasams sad part is it requires 30 saints quartz to summon ten things and it's not guaranteed to get the servant you want so think before you install but otherwise to me it's great over all to play also it can be hard to grind 30 saints quarts and the story is really good
"Really fun game. Just its a gacha game sometimes it can be annoying, but the story and game play is really good. Especially for a mobile game"
Gacha percentage is just pure garbage üóëÔ∏è
Actual hell.
Sure
"A great game, awesome story/lore and kind of challenging every time you proceed with the next one. Edit: In summoning I'd prefer if it's servants instead of craft items. Also what's wrong with can't connect with server error?"
It's a very cool and interesting game
"Update: Sadly have to downgrade my review. The game simply isn't fun to play anymore and the devs do everything possible to make it a chore to play. Story is great, but 80% of the game is farming and that part sucks. Love the characters and spending time to make them stronger. Great to play before bed, and the events and story are awesome."
"5‚òÜs aren't everything, the story is beautiful and the characters are lovable."
"Good story, gameplay is completely wack"
Extremely better than 7ds Grand Cross
"Game itself is good, story starts off slow but gets great, maybe one of the best available in mobile. The gacha aspect is horrible tho and why it's 4 instead of 5 stars. Very low rates, no pity system. That said the game can be completed free to play and spending isn't necessary but you will probably want to eventually and getting a rare limited servant most likely will not come cheap unless you are supremely lucky."
I hate it. It is the manifestation of evil itself 5/5 stars
One of the best free games you don't have to pay a dime it will be harder but you can clear everything using the free characters. The gacha might have no pity rolls and bad percenta but the free characters can carry you so it doesn't matter.
"Easily the best mobile game I've played in terms of story. The Gacha system isn't ideal, but it's definitely free-to-play friendly if you don't mind putting in some extra effort."
best ever
My wifu
Please update some of the servant's animation
"Really Fun game,great story,great animations, the events are fun . Finally a game that has strong free characters and useful low rarity ones."
well need more feature I guess..
Awesome game!!!!
"No other gacha has held my attention for so long. Story is rough at the beginning, but hold out til Camelot and it gets amazing from there. Regarding the gacha, it is worth noting that all content can be cleared with low rarity characters, and in fact some low rarity characters are meta."
Enjoyable and interesting
I really loved the story they created for this game. The traveling to different period and dialogue was invoke emotions well.
Content start getting stale
Rolled bride nero that is all
Worst Gacha Rate Ever But Still Playing It.If you guys might a little rate up character drop We'll be greatful
"Great game,music,characters and gameplay but if your really salty about not getting the character you want I just wanna say same bruh. Another great thing about this game its pretty easy to stay f2p ive been playing for a year and I haven't a single peso."
Did you remove the servants in the featured banners?
Damn this game is tight 10/10 I want more Rin faces
Il give it a 5 star bc of the story. Its so creative and epic
Pls gib sq
üòº
"Great game. Would be great if story segments could reach the end, allow me to read the text log AND THEN move on to the battle. Give a clear gambling warning before allowing 1 tap buying, and a small but easily seen warning about gambling in the quartz buying page. It doesn't seem like a big thing, but taking gambling into account is important. Especially since many people don't think there's a gambling risk with gacha games."
"This might be a bit extra, but remember guys, each transfer code can only be used ONCE. So unless you want to go through the hassle of losing your account because you forgot to create a new code and have to send emails to recover it, like my idiotic self did, you should remember to create one after every transfer. Also great game. 8/10 (Deducted 2 for the inconvenient backup method)"
Gameplay is subpar but it has one of the most engaging and definitive story that you can have and it is a F2P game to boot. You can finish the quest with just 1 star units. Online interaction is just supp system with no high reward for whalers overall a loved franchise for me. Been playing it for 3 years now and it never stops to entertain me.
"Was working fine yesterday ever since I try to login little while ago it says it needs to update but the store says there is no update. So now I can't login because of this fix this error edit. Was able to update, though it still does not show up on the main app page"
Love it for its story and characters.
Even though ssr are hard to get you gotta give love to some 1-3 star servant the stories are great
"addictive, unique and fun. the biggest reason why it's so enjoyable to me is probably because i've had quite good luck in terms of the gacha + not had high expectations to get rare units. honestly, every unit is playable and winnable; there's a lot of diversity to appeal to everyone's tastes."
The only complaint that i have is that the summoning should have a pity system so most players can get a good character after spending lots of quartz
Why?? It's fate. What could've possibly go wrong with that
Definitely predatory.
"Great game, the gacha make me question my own existence, great story. 10/10 not recommended ( unless you are know what you're going to get into)"
Great game if you love fate but up the gacha rates and put a pity system in like most gacha games for the love of god.
This is perfect game
Very fun and addictive game play be prepared for typical gacha things but still fun
Grindy as hell and very manipulative Servants are cool and the story is fun though
"I've played this game for 4 years now but it never ceases to amaze me with its continuous content and unique story and well made characters!! The development team really work hard and it makes me happy to see our support go a long way in building this series for the better in anime, events, and the cool merch. 12/10 would recommend to jump into the fate train"
"3 stars at best, It is not a perfect game TBH i really hate it but after trying and persevering after 3 months yes 3 months r needed to have a stable economy. I'm hooked becuz of the characters, the gacha is trash, story is great. The only thing i really hate is the limited time events that has a free characters (y not make it a permanent event) or mystic code u need to buy them with rare prisms (which is really rare to get as f2p yes 10 months only got 2 pcs of rare) don't dl this is a hellhole"
Garbage
I love the game but came to Mexico for vacation I have wifi connection but is not letting me play it
Wonderful game that isn't like most mobile games. It isn't trash like most.
Have you guys ever decided to try out another anime franchise collab besides another fate franchise ‚ù§Ô∏è2 see itü§õüèªü§õüèª‚úåüèªüññüèª.
Everything about it is good but when you hit Camelot you will have to start grinding heavily

"Overall the game is just fine and enjoyable and also bit easy to understand the game but my only problem is that sometimes the game suddenly freeze or get stuck which force me to turn off my wifi then turn it ot again and the other problem is that the game really cause me so much storage which I just want save my storage to download what I want, I just hoping that this game won't waste so much of storage and as fate series fan, I love this game!"
I need to get my stuff back I don't remember my numbers or password I had good servants to and it sucks cuz I have to start all over other then that the game is fun and to kill time with but please help
Great game but please increase the drop rate for banner servants
"Used to play years ago. Had a review but, I guessed they deleted it to keep fake ratings. 1. Boring gameplay 2. Very repetitive 3. Stupidly low drop rates If you want to waste money on art then sure go and play but you can probably find all the pictures online for free."
"This game has one of the BEST stories ever and I have played and watched over 3000 things. It also has a myriad of events that come periodically and each with a unique quests, storylines and rewards. The thing that makes it so amazing is the writing. The writers are creative, and have satire with many levels. The characters(Servants) each have unique styles of talking and I can the accuracy is astonishing. Their is depiction is justified. The game is simply a MUST PLAY."
Girl astolfo when
I efking hate this game...
"They don't care about their player base at all, and are the only existing entity that doesn't consider proof of purchase a way to identify and recover a lost account. It's a shame, because I had liked this game."
"I've downloaded the game but at the moment I cant play due to it not being able to connect to the game server. Can I ask for help, I've played the game before and a fan of it."
Always bad luck at summoning even i spent 300 saint
Worst game.
Great story and the gameplay is simple but fun. Customer support was really helpful and quick when I lost access to my account. You can finish story line with almost any character which is nice.
Fun. Good story. But repetitive in gameplay. No real pitty which does hurt.
Yawa sanaol nalang ang malas ko sa gachaüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Good game and kinda bad gacha rates and no skip option to grind or just like auto cuz dont expect us to sit here for 4 hours grinding that's just boring so kinda make an auto or an skip option
Just don't install the game you never want to play it.
The story is amazing and the gameplay is fun at first. But when you need to grind it really makes me want to delete the app. There is also the problem of no pity system. I have saved 250 sqs for Arjuna alter but couldn't get it. Some people even spending thousands and might not get it
Amazing game for fate fans and very nice animations.
"I hate this game cuz the gacha make me piss me off, why they set up 30 Saint Quartz? It should be 10 to 20. Why can just do some fair to fair. You know what, think this as a protest. Btw good game tho."
üëçüèΩ
Pay more than 700 SQ and didn't get 1 SSR. Thanks for the trash rate up
"Surprisingly not as money grab as other Gacha games. That being said, it's hard to get nice new characters. Story is nice and engaging. Game play is interesting."
Please Emiya come to chaldea
"Love the anime and that's what lead me to the game, but I hate the summoning, I hate save up hundreds of quartz and not getting featured characters. Not for new players at all"
"Very low gacha rates, but amazing story if you're a fan of type-moon works."
Saved quartz for 10 months and didn't get the rate up SSR I wanted. I love the characters. The gameplay is good for idling. The rng is garbage and greedy. Play another game imo
"I have to say, the characters, the series, even the gameplay and strategies in this game are amazing. However the fact this game is SO against people who play free and are ENTIRLY trying to just take your cash is a freaking crime. I saved up for 7 months trying to Arjuna Alter and got over 300 quartz. Not only did I not get Arjuna, and I didn't get ANY 4 or 5 star servants. At the freaking LEAST make it so after 100 rolls you can get the 5 star guaranteed or soemthing.. every other game does ‚òπ"
This is hell and I like it
"Don't use transfer ID or remember your friend code, then say gg to your account."
Despite Having High revenue Devs are lazy and greedy.
"-Outdated UI -Low 5‚≠ê rates which makes your efforts or money go to waste -Very limited SQ -Devs are lazy when it comes to attack animation ,which make them look very ugly sometimes -This game is bloated and cost really high GB(6-10gb) even though it has simple graphics . -Loading takes long smts. unlike other games. -AP takes too long to recover and ap needed at quest are high. Also mat RNG is also low -Only story is GUD Conclusion is Devs are lazy and greedy af. Find other better gacha game."

This game won't stop taking my money and now I'm in massive financial debt and filing for bankruptcy but i have a jpeg of my waifu so all in all pretty good game
Keren
So salty right now. No new ssr since Jan 2021 (gssr give me a freaking dup) . Im always saving around 200 sq to my target banner. Guess not getting Arjuna alter is my sign to stop spending and playing this game. Edit: gonna spend my money to genshin impact at least they have pity lmao.
"100% Terrific! Why don't you make a forth chapter (2.5) about singularity belts, it's more of a singularity, but the elements are of a lost belt."
If you're reading this and you're about to download it. Be careful. That's hell you're walking into
After years its overall fun and enjoyment I received from playing is gone. The game has gotten extremely boring. I think it's time for a new game. Hopefully you guys have the next game in dev. Because for me the chapter of me being an active player is over. It's not worth playing anymore.
Great fate experience
Love the game but after completion of the first anomaly it can't connect to the server. Very dissappointed that I can't progress now.
"Real fun gacha game, the character sprites are really well done and the storylines are pretty good."
"10 out 10 love the game, only problem is archer class gilgamesh is not in my box yet.üò¢"
Too much gacha
10/10 would recommend if ur a whaler
Pretty cool for a free game
"Story is really good, but the gacha is awful. More CE, less servants. You should put CE drop rate up, instead of servant drop rate up."
The fate/ franchise was found years ago and now I believe it is spread worldwide. What I'm asking is that you should bring not only the English voice actors but other country language voice actors as well for diversity. Also try a way to allow players to get free quartz faster. And make a way to allow us to save game progress through face or Twitter. These are the reasons why this game currently deserves 4 star rating. Thank you for reading.
"They did a very creative job at modernizing the historical, mythological and other fictional characters. It's fun to hear them interact with each other. Though the events may be quite active the stories won't disappoint. The games style is fun and challenging, however, it could be dragging as you have to focus on every battles if you're not strong enough during event farming."
So fun i realy recomend to play it
I love the story and as a single player game its not as pay to when ad other phone games but it is obvious that buying the in game currency gives you a better chance of getting a 5 star servent still they are not required to when I put around 50 dollars in this game by buying packs when they came with deals and I fill like I got my moneys worth out of the game.
it is the fearst game that i got intrested in the story
Love the game but u should give quartz for completing quests for example instead of doing 5 quests then getting the 1 quartz you get 1 for all and maybe 2 for the last quest
Great game but it need auto battle.
"I have been playing this game for hundreds of days, and I still love it to bits, it almost never gets old for me. Although a new pity system or a Unregistered Spirit Origin system for SRs would be very much appreciated"
Fun and relaxing
"It's decent enough mechanic-wise, but the main appeal is the story and characters. If you like to skip dialog in gachas, maybe pass on this one."
FUN!
the gacha is hell.. but the content is top-tier amazing! there's no reason to skip ü•∞
Its Super Nice Game
"The game is too grindy,it might be ""f2p friendly"" because you can complete everything with the bare minimum units,but the game is incredibly draining when you need resources. The gameplay might be fun,but if you play like that for hours on end it will drain you. The rng in this game is extremely unforgiving and after 2 hours of grinding i didn't get what i need at all. This would all be fine if most events weren't locked for certain level players only. This game is bad for new players."
Thos game sucks! MAKE ME VERY HAPPY
Game sucks 10/10
"The gameplay is fun, but the gacha rates are kind of bad. Overall I enjoy playing it."
"Very addictive, Great and immersive story, Fun gameplay, 5 out of 5!"
Gacha cries
certified best waifu simulator
Gameplay can be boring in 2021 but I still love it and the story is excellent. Game is gives a lot of free currency as well if you work for it. Not too grindy on a normal day (which is great unlike other gacha games since it feels like a chore) but will suck out your soul if you go all out on the grind heavy events especially if you cram them.
"I lost my account i hope it can back and hope you can change the way to login in this game, these days even before i could login into any game using social media, and the way this game make this more difficult using transfer code even it just for 1 transfer make it more nonsense"
Fantastic game
Great anime game
The game is awesome
"Rate up is a lie. And we are YEARS behind JPN, with no plan to catch up."
Great story but the ultra low 5 star drop rate will destroy your wallet. Game play is a rock paper scissors spock system where having the right mix of characters in your line up is important towards your strategy in beating certain battles.
Lost my characters in this latest update. Not cool bro.
"Play this game for the story, or if you're a big Fate/Type-Moon fan. Otherwise you might have a bad time."
"This game is overall pretty balanced. The drip rates are abysmal though. The story itself isn't that good up until Camelot (though E Pluribus Unum was also pretty entertaining). An advice to people downloading this, don't sleep on your low star servants. Most of them are great. Also, I feel the need to address this after seeing some of the reviews. SSRs aren't everything. You can literally clear 90% of the game with just 1~3 star servants. Honako Green on YT has proven that."
"Story is OK, and characters are unique. Only bad thing is the summon rates are abysmal. I've spent about $20k on this game, and the rates are horrendous. Do not expect to get your favorite character immediately even with money (spent $2,000 to get one Summer Jeanne) unless your lucky. Beware this game, at your own risk."
"Its great to see all the historical figures and to learn about them in your free time. Story is fantastic, events are quite entertaining only issue is the grind."
"ü•∞Super Story line(like the anime) üòíDraw Rates a little low ü§®Award Drop Rates too low ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCrystal prices too high üò≠Crystal Award rate too low Has it become a ""pay to win""? Leaves me ü•∂. However, I keep coming back to see if they are listening to us veterans. I want to ""WANT"" to play this game."
the drop rate sucks but im too invested in the story and characters to stop playing
Best game i ever played on a mobile device .Wish more developers would care about their games like fate.
yeet
BATTLE OTHER MASTERS LIKE DO A THING WHERR U HOST A GRAIL WAR WITH OTHER PPL OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS GETTING HELLA BORING
"Gameplay might not be the FGO's strong suit, but with regards to its story, plot and events, FGO exceeds my expectations. We get to see how Master develops, how the servants drive the story forward, and how the story unfolds when faced with multiple conflicts. FGO has kept me entertained for nearly 2 years now, and I am still looking forward to what the story tellers will present to us in the future."
"If you really like the Fate universe (or even the Nasuverse as a whole), this game is for you. Do be warned that the game has a slow start in its story but by the 5th chapter, the story picks up into something amazing that stay pretty consistent after. The story mode so far took over 200 hours for me. Also, while its fun to earn new characters, the rates for 5 stars is VERY low with no real pity system, so be REAL careful on who you want to roll for. Hint: Look up guides on skill details."
"I really like the story, characters are pretty cool, and who doesn't like broken gacha rates that make you want to cry?"
One advice in one word (patience)
"I love the fate series, and this game does it justice. I love this game!"
"The game is exceptionally good, the only downside being the amount of time spent on grinding for ascension materials, other than that, the game is indeed awesome"
"I really like this game, it has a simple gameplay that is easy to understand and is fun, not only that the story is really good as well, If you like the Fate franchise I would definitely recommend this game"
"The conection took so much time to begin the game, could the programers fix it? Everythings else is good btw"
Great story and characters. Worst gacha of any game ever. Interesting balance.
"Its the perfect game for a weeb like me great story, waifus, and action love it"
It is a fun game but the character drop and upgrades need to be easier.
"Great game, addicting only complain rlly is the 4* higher servant drop rate."
"I like this game. No, really.... I liiikkkkeeeee this game. You got to get if you dont have. Just sayin!"
Just think it's an awesome game and pretty addicted
Love fate
"Fate/GO is a PVE game focused on it's story and characters. The story writing becomes better overtime, while characters are varied, their gameplay mechanics is what you may be after for rolling for them. Each one of the Servants are unique and best used if the Master knows what they're doing. The difficulty curve can become overwhelming by the time you reach the new chapters. Although the game can become easier if you got certain servants, but the game can still throw you off sometimes."
Gimme jalter
"It's really good game.Good story, good characterizations. And it's fun to play. Kudos!"
"10/10, that's gacha hell you'r walking into"
"Awesome story,awesome animation, awesome characters in conclusion 10/10 would not recommend"
Splendid! I cannot wait for more updates in animation and upcoming stories. Keep up the good work. You have my thanks.
Great game. Feels like I'm a real master in a Holy Grail War blown out of proportions. Fans of Fate and other Type-Moon works will love this.
It's gacha hell but I love it
Nice game! Just hope I can actually summon the characters I like.
This is a gambling addiction!!! Be extremely cautious
"Why the F is this game so low in America? Are people lazy pigs that can't read and only Bam to Chinese pictures and play low quality farm games that have no quality story to begin with? Whoops my bad. Seriously you people are missing out on a lot. Please help build this game and it's community, you'll 80% not regret it."
Love the story!
Been playing for 3 years now its one of my favorite games Not recommended
I like it but if I got many saint quarts and I summon it.. I got the weak one but and because of the graphics
As a huge fan of this franchise the story line of this is incredible and gameplay is pretty awesome too it is somewhat p2w but regardless its the best game i can always go back to mobile wise
Its very good
C·ª•t
"Great story, characters and simple controls.... only issue is either the summon drop rates need to be higher, prices for saints quartz need to be lower or the devs need to be a bit more generous to the dedicated players and long time/consecutive players. (2 saints quartz for logging in 20 days in a row is laughable) I'm a returning player with a new account and it's shocking that it hasn't improved since the last time I played it."
"I love and adore this game,But there's one prob STUFF AND ACCIDENTS HAPPEN,What I mean is that if you lose your transfer number and your phone broke or accidentally deleted the game you have no way of getting back into the game knowing this is a really really grindy game and you lose everything,I recommend Gmail login so that if you loose your transfer number you can still access your account"
"So I love this game, I really do. I love the characters, I love the story, I love the gacha part of the game. In general I adore it! But I'm so freaking mad right now because I had to delete all of my progress in order to fix the issue where the loading screen was pitch black. All of that progress, gone üò≠ I still like the game. I really do. However, I'm so frustrated with it right now."
Gameplay and story are great. My only complaint is that the gacha rated are insanely LOW. A 0.700% chance to get a 5 star servant makes no sense. Rate-ups need to improve. Also the repetitiveness of rolling duplicate servants needs to be toned down a bit.
"Good game, been playing since release"
Good ig
Best ever
Pls just pls make this run on 60 fps on mobile phahahaha
After the game wouldn't start i finally again and my account was wiped
"If you're gonna play this game for the gameplay, you won't last long. The community play this game for mostly the story which is arguably amazing. If you're gonna play this for collecting the characters, oh dear God. 5*s have 0.8 drop rate, I rest my case. And to add, it can be very grindy. 5 star for me cause I like my pain. You'll probably learn to have a love-hate relationship with this if you're patient enough."
"A lot of fun for a while, but can became more frustrating than fun over time. Overall not bad free2play. But it does have some of the pain that can come with free2play."
This game suck its better when it was just an anime movie i wish is just an anime not a stupid game.
"More then enough Bussy, 11/10"
"Overall good story, some good waifus, since you are a loner, you could probably make one or two friends here, and of course you can make your own 2d harem, who will wish you happy birthday, give you chocolates on valentines day. just one thing..... GIVE ME A MORDRED ALREADY."
Hey..That's hell you're walking into.
For me?? üòçüòç
Good!
Awesome üî•it's like I am watching the Anime üòé
"The game keeps connecting and ended up losing my acc by reinstalling the game bscause my friend recommended me this gacha game and it's my second gacha game and i've lost all my progress,servants It was lvl 50 napoleon, lvl 50 sima yi And i still have 2 sima yi on my inventory I even have proof for that"
"Great game, gameplay Is pretty simple but fun, the characters are the best part of the game and I have a gatcha problems so that's a plus. But the negatives are pretty large. There is ALOT of grinding like alot and ap is a bit annoying but that's all. Over all game if your going to try it and are enjoying it keep going to Camelot, if you can get there and complete that then your in for a long one, oh and one more thing, that's hell your walking into."
"If for every event you blast $1000.00 by all means. It nothing but farming to no end, and wasting hours to get maybe through one section. It used to be fun now it just tireless farming"
"Fate/Grand plagiarism is a compilation of modern values. The brazen theft of ideas from world culture and paraphrased platitudes each character will inevitably spout portrays the mental absenteeism present in today's world, where stealing = creating, babbling bombastic gibberish = cleverness and great writing; it is a train of impressions, a haven for the thoughtless."
Give me more saint quartz please I have an addiction
Gacha gacha gacha!!!
Good game. Bad pulls.
Support system for reaching accounts is not helpful.
"Been playing this game for a month now but recently its been acting very very slow, it would take about 1 minute sometimes doubled just to log in,even if my wifi is strong."
Failed to connect to game server.I hate this :(
"Honestly, this game seemed like fun sad it would've been if the servers weren't so dogshit. Every time I started a mission or skipped the story it would say connection lost then retry and I did but it just crashes every time."
"This game has a very interesting story and lots of wonderful characters, the gameplay is fun and keeps you interested. Grinding events can be difficult and it is not for everyone, but I definitely reccomend the story."
It's a fun game
Game doesn't have NP skip. No pity in gacha. The banners are filled with trash essence and have very low rates. At least try to seperate the CEs from units. Though it does try it's best to balance the units' skills(i think). And guaranteed is only for whales and dolphins. If you go ftp youll never get the char you want unless you hoard quarts for at least half a year üòÖ
"Its a good game, the only issue I have is that this game is the king of grind and hard as fk rates, there are guides and etc to help you, to those thinking of getting this game know this: thats hell you're walking into"
It's a fun game that involves multiple characters from the franchise. It has recent updates. It has a long story if u like that. It's not bad at all.
"It keeps saying ""Check connection"" while I'm already beside our router, thus my connection is stronger as your relationship. And when you click ""restart"", it exits the entire game, just like how I wish i could exit my relationship w/ her. Being single is better."
The game looks great but i cant play it.like i restart and relogin but i just cant play it and i want to so can you please fix it.please and thank you
One of the best gacha games ive ever played my only problem is the gacha rate
"Honestly, the games story is pretty good so far, but the fact that you're forced to bring a support servant thing or whatever on EVERY single quest is far to intrusive and annoying for me to actually enjoy any of the story. It's a horrible feature and should be made optional like FFBE:WOTV's (or basically any other mobile rpg's) companion system."
Your game sucks after $1200 and taking a break from the game just so it won't load past the starting point 4yrs of playing for this just wow
Best waifu game
Improve the gameplay lmao
Great game however did a Data Transfer between phones. Few days played normal but not playing for one day to come to play the game now and find all my data of almost 2 years had disappeared...not happyüò†
Great!
Played 2 years on a account then I come back and now I can't get it back. All that time wasted if you get this game try your best to not lose you account so dumb
Gaia
"I like the game a lot. The writing is sharp and the Mehouso event was really funny. It's the unforgiving gacha summoning system. It takes pleasure in mocking me and giving me the same e star silver servants over and over. 15 Madae's and Gile Se Rais later im stuck hoping certain Ascension material is farmable and nope sorry. Like, the game is too unforgiving and makes it less fun. If it werent for the daily log-in bonuses i wouldnt play daily."
my comfort game just wished there were more content after story
You know this is quite the wonderful game and may I make a suggestion is if you could put Alexander Hamilton into it
3 years since I initially reviewed this game. I now have a gambling addiction and an alarmingly large collection of waifu JPEGs. 5/5
Gacha is hell . . . . . I like it
Great game pretty neat combat system never seen it used like this and isn't pay to win
Love this game with every fiber of my being
Hooked ‚ú®
I am love it game
So hard to get Arturia üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I want to see what tis does for the good.
"Though I call myself a fan of the setting, the artstyle and franchise as a whole, the grindy predatory nature of progression and the core gameplay of Grand Order leave much to be desired, compared to its direct competition."
"Story was portrayed excellent. Game Mechanics is good. Just the gacha rate tho. I once had that 10X pull and i only got event exclusive CE. I hoped for a servant tho. But yeah in the end, it's gacha xD"
waifu is laifu
"Gacha game with a fun story, cool characters, and is based on a group of anime series called fate."
"Grinding is ridiculous, two years to get any good summons."
Tis good
Sold my house for my waifu
Good. Made me gay though.
Give me jalter pls.
Most satisfying gaming app to ever come across. You'll absolutely get hooked if your into the anime and in these strategic games.
"Totally awesome game... Profound game play, Beautiful Noble Phantasms..."
"I absolutely love this game, not only for the story, but also because it enables the ability to learn more about some of history's and mythology's greatest figures."
"Story: So much more than I was expecting when I first downloaded the game, constantly expanding and entertaining. Plot: There us one and then there the PLOT. Drop Rates: Pain. Just pain. Summary: Download to find out what all those DJs have been about but don't drop money unless you plan on never stopping. Just don't."
Where is Jaune Arc in the game.i want Jaune arc in the game?
Nice. A great help for a fan of Fate Franchise.
Fun and addictive! Frequent updates make the game lag but an enjoyable experience overall! Be careful with spending summon quartzes as the servants aren't always the ones you want!
My bank account cries
I've been playing the game since the the second year it came out and I've really enjoyed the anime this story of a game is why I gave it a 5 star and the gameplay mechanics would get another 5. This game makes you think before making decisions
"An excellent experience. The gameplay when you look at the details actually has a lot of depth, warts and all. It's a slow burn but the story from chapter 6 starts to really engage and continues to build upon itself. I'm not going to lower my rating but the gacha (RNG character collection) is extremely unforgiving. The extremely low chance to get the 5 stars characters with a practically nonexistent guarantee is very anticlimactic. The community is fantastic."
I don't care as long as it's from the Fate franchise. üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ Those who whine about how they didn't get what Servants they want are those people who rely on pay to win methods. Free to play gamers are more likely to last in this game since they are more used on relying on luck and hardwork to get the best out of their gaming experience. Kudos to TYPE-MOON for givingi Altria SSR! üí™üí™üòäüòäüòäüí™üí™
"A great game overall, a f2p friendly game but kind of lacks something (I think its about time fgo add a pity system for the reason that saint quartz is hard to earn and the rate up sucks)"
Haha cock wizard goes brrrrrt
Fun for the most part but the rate up is a lie.
"Welcome to Hell, I love it."
This is a terrible game that will take all of your time and money and you can never escape. If you love the fate franchise you will never stop playing even though gameplay is repetitive and gacha rates suck. 5 stars
Good other than the amount of grinding it take later on in the game
Pretty cool game
Good game genuinely. But if you have a favorite servant and they are a 5 Star all I have to say is good luck.
pls make it easier to farm mats like auto farming ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
I love the game but i hate how account binding isn't in this game it makes me angry the time i got a 5 star but my game crashed and needed to delete cache which deleted my progress
Its a great game!
"I played this game for about 4 months right now, and I really enjoy it. The only problem that I got so far that it is so hard to get some spesific items for upgrading skills or ascension, so I hope there will be a shop for these items. Thank you"
One piece vs fae
The Story and The Event was good. The most need of upgrade is the gameplay. Ah and this game mechanism bind was great though. It don't need any bind to google account nor social media. Only need bind code and password. I lost my account once and contact the cs it recover my lost account between 2 days or less i think. Great job
"Been playing since release. The story is great and yeah it can be a money pit, but if you save up Saint Quartz and plan properly you'll get what you want."
GACHA GACHA
ako c Gilgamesh
Gib me jalter
Don't play this game lol
Can't open the game now. App shut down the moment it is launch
The gacha makes me wanna die but sexy waifu go brrrrrrr
"I got the 5* star that I wanted, so I rate 5*s... What do you mean this isn't how you write a review? All the salty E-rank luck players are doing it this way..."
I just want saber from ubw
"This game is made on a shoestring budget, it barely runs on a flagship phone due to poor coding and they reuse the same 4 characters dozens of times."
bad rates but good game all in all
"Hey, that's hell you're walking into"
"Great game it got me hooked the moment I started playing, the gameplay is a bit laggy on occasion but still manageable, the controls are also easy to understand and remember, just wished that the system/server maintenance didn't take 12hrs, other than the maintenance waiting time it's all good for me."
Rate up sucks lol
One of the best gacha game ever!
Ahh the hell I'm looking for
I hate gacha
"This game has basic and repetitive combat, the grinding gets annoying and the Chase to get a servant to begin with is impossible thanks to the overwhelming amount of craft essences, and the chance to get a 5 or 4 star is absolutely abysmal, the game is good but it can all be explained in 1 sentence, it's amazing . . . The first time you see it, the combat is fun and refreshing the first time, the enemy's are cool and original, the first time, and the abilities look amazing the first time"
"Honestly, only thing that holds this game back are the rates and the grinding."
Waifu > meta
It's fun lol
All boils down to luck
Waifu gacha!
This game is really good in a lot of areas. I think the story and gameplay is really great and the events are nice too. I even think that the pulls from the quartz system are fair. My only gripe with this game is a big one. Theres not an easy way to recover data. I got a new phone and my old one got wiped which saddens me because i had a lot of event servants and was pretty far in the story and now its hard to get back into the game starting over from the begining
"It has fun mechanics and gameplay and you can progress through the game using 1-3 stars. I also like that they added a support unit to make the game easier for new players. The only main problem with this game is the gacha and events. the gacha rates are terrible: 1% for a five star. I would recommend raising it to 2% and adding a pity system. Also, I feel like craft ecensses shouldn't have higher chance than actual character. Events are locked until you are deep in the game, I cant play them"
"I definitely enjoy the Anime more than the game! I downloaded this game but sorry to say, it just did nothing for me."
Give me my jalter please
Game is fun but the customer service is terrible! I had an issue and they repeatedly ignored me and would refuse to answer me after I explained the issue. Would hate to see how they treat people who haven't made any in-game purchases.
"This isn't a bad game. Decent art, characters and stories, decent leveling system, but it's so slow! I don't just mean it loads slowly, but it takes two to three levels of two to three waves at least to advance even slightly in the dialogue. The battles themselves are painfully slow, simple and repetitive. If you don't mind that, it's a decent game."
The Ui sucks it's super outdated
"Need a better account saving method. It would be a lot better if we can actually link the game to social media accounts and be accessed in different devices.. but overall, very fun and addictive game! love it"
Nice rate
Hell.
Amazing game I'm addicted to this but suddenly it stop working on my phone saying check your network connection. but my connection is strong so why? So sadüò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Top tier Gacha games
This game ruined my life and put me in a financial crisis. However at least I have my virtual Waifus.
"I love the writing. I love the characters. I love the art. The gameplay is decent at the best of times, and a horrible chore with complete bs mechanics at the worst of times. Summoning in this game is the most painful experience out of every gacha game that I have ever experienced. However, just about every character is viable depending on the scenario. This game is one of the oldest gacha games, and it shows. Serious overhauls need to happen if this game wants to exist moving into the future."
"Great game, excellent story though a bit long winded. The game mechanics are average, however the greatest down fall is how badly optimise the game is. Nonetheless great game for fate fans"
"Loading screen sometimes dont work, summons sometimes stall and then just stay loading. You cant even get in a game without waiting 2000 hours"
Women!
Do not play worst decision of my life
Started of with this game as positive. Now I hate this game tbh. Outdated combat system and the game is too grindy. No Auto or skip ticket. Needs to clear latest story chapter so that you could participate in a new event. Gacha rate is down bad. No pity means you're relying on your luck even you have saved up hundreds of SQ(premium currency) if your luck is bad. Don't expect too much on this game.
super cool
Where is my Artoria Pendragon? trqsh
"Excellent storytelling (especially after 5th Singularity), lots of interesting character designs, freedom to change character's ascension look, and story and character dialogues that can be revisited at anytime. However, the negatives are what makes the game feel outdated compared to other games. To name some: no widescreen support, no 60fps, no 3D/Live2D sprites. 3D/Live2D sprites may not be appropriate in battle, but it can still be implemented in My Room and Chaldea terminal."
"Lets be honest, the only reason people play this ""game"" is because it's ""fate"""
Love the game keep up the great work!!!!!!!
rates are too low
I tried rolling. I had to wait for 10 minutes for the whole session to finish.
S A L T
"One my fave games, it has it's fair share of ups and downs but regardless i still play and love it, yes the gacha is the worst but all the more better when you get that servant you wanted for so long, i see a lot of people complaining about not having pity, first time? I have been playing for so long and haven't spent a single penny and got a lot of the servants i want, stop hating on the game if you don't get what u want and just hope for better luck, if u can't do that Quit the game."
5 star for 5 star servant
Hey you want free 4 star character cards np just play event Oh wait you can't do event come back when you finish the story that requires you to do Wait story is too long for you And characters ai is too difficult for you fight np just pay the star gems to stay alive even your card is max out you still die np Come back again when you got new 5 star cards character you never get mostly get craft cards every time endlessly To me is not even worth to play it
"I like it, but DO NOT BOTHER. Fate/ Grand Order plays like the old school Final Fantasy games. Skills stack for combos, etc etc While I say that, you don't get the ability to recover your progress if you uninstall, at least, I haven't found one. And I've looked. The most you get is a recovery ID for swapping devices. The gacha rates are awful. Did I say awful? They're worse than. You don't have drop protection, period. The system is designed to exploit players with gambling addictions."
"Terrible gacha mechanics, great story after the first few chapters, nice event rewards but honestly i don't enjoy it like i used to. try not to spend money on the gacha. i do not like the lack of viable pity system."
Great app no problems at all great story aswell!
"The new Android update isn't allowing me to boot up the game. This is the second time the update had prevented the app from opening within the span of a year. I highly suggest everyone not to uninstall the App if you are a faithful player, unless you have your transfer code saved. Edited: fixed, but this is the second time it had happened. It also took about two weeks to have it fixed."
Good Story Great Art. Horrible Rates.
"This is one of the best rpg I've ever played. Due to its connection to history, I liked the storyline and fighting scenes."
This game is great been a solo player with hard quest.
Good game gaizzzzz
The rates for the game and the rewards for the game are not worth it. At least with the bad rates give more summons but quartz are very hard to get. Content is good. Gameplay is mediocre.
More drop rate for ssr pls:3
Nerofest is best.
A good game but can you fix the suddenly slowing in character draw i think i am not sure what was it name but it was a really good game
Its A Nice game
Game is most certainly good even with the horrible drop rates of 4* & 5* but whatever I enjoy it.
"The writing is fantastic, don't get me wrong on that. But to get to said writing, you need to go through several singularities of more... Questionable writing. Your Gacha system has no safety net unlike virtually all of the competitors, and that just frankly doesn't cut it in 2021 especially with Cygames. The game's also really not new player friendly, since the dailies kinda suck, and half the time, the latest event is story-locked behind most of the game."
"I am playing this game in order to sell my account at this point. That's right, its gotten to that point. Originally i started off trying to get my dream team and have fun with events but days turned into months turned into YEARS....and now i know the only way i would ever get what i want is spending a lot of my free time and a lot of money, so now im finished. Thanks for nothing. Hope your cash cow stays milkable and i hope the wonderful community keeps embracing getting robbed."
"Do yourself a favor and never spend a dime and you'll have a great time. Gets fantastic in the second arc, which is actually the third arc, but whatever. Some characters and representations are a bit raunchy in ways they should not be, but I think they fired the guy that kept making THOSE characters, because they stop being a thing in the second (third) arc."
"The gacha game I stocked with for years... Rate up is a lie and if you stay long enough you will prob spend money. F2p us possible, and you will mainly role if you are horny for a character. I like it"
Its fun
"A truly amazing game, I definitely look forward to the updates that are soon to come and the update that I am downloading now can't wait to experience it and I also hope that you guys make better ways to get 5 Star Heroes"
I love all kinds of legends. Thanks to this game I can fight along side my favorite historical figures
very enjoyable story
biggest thing about this game is you don't have to do the gotchas to get good stuff and enjoy it
"Rates are horrible, plus obtaining enough Saint Quartz for a summon is pretty hard."
This game is the best but it needs online multiplayer
"Incompetent. One of the loc staff, Albert, makes everything about himself and his mediocre account. WE DON'T CARE, SHUT UP FOR ONCE. He would rather focus on his narcissistic selfishness rather than HIS JOB and it really shows in the end product on the game and other aniplex products. Get rid of his stupidity, get better staff, ffs. Especially get better staff that doesn't try to have large indoor events in the middle of a dangerous pandemic."
Love this game and the anime series!
"I have played this game for Atleast Half A Year Last Year to this Month, I really Liked Everything except the Gacha, Because believe it or not, I got 95% Get Rate of Craft Essence In each of my Spin but it always Consisted Of 4 & 5 Stars except i have too many and What i get doesn't Ascend What i have, That is the only problem i have, and Im kinda what you call Unlucky but i think you should make an Event where Servant Drop Rate Ups by 5% or Make the 1 or 2% Rate to 5%."
"Fun game. Great story, interesting characters and amazing artwork. Just wish getting materials and servants was easier. The gacha for servants and craft essence should be separate in my opinion. Otherwise it's a great game."
"Super Fun, Good Story, Nice Mechanics, help me i'm in debt. 11/10"
very epic
"Story writing is amazing and the only thing that makes me continue playing the game. The events feel like a chore and they don't make it friendly for new players, it is like they are purposely ruining their own game."
I love it this is my favorite now!!!
Love the graphics and gameplay! Easy to play if this is your 1st time playing this type of game.
Its a really good game with a good story but tends to have long breaks when it comes to updating to every other version of the game in different countries.
"It has a GREAT story, interesting and loveable characters, and it's entirely possible to play without spending real money."
Fun times for sure.
"Super fun waifu/husbando simulator, gameplay is fun independent of the weeb stuff. Save your quartz for something you really want, gacha has brutal probabilities."
The worst gacha rates you'll ever see on a game. If you want to enjoy this game I hope you have deep pockets. Greedy to no end when I can blow 300 dollars over 500 Saint quartz) worth of premium currency and you can't be asked to give me the servant I badly wanted. PS rates for five star servants is 0.7% not even 1%
Took my money and time. Love it
Not helping me restore my old fate game account even though I followed all of the instructions.
"Lost my previous data, unable to transfer my existing account to new phone. I had the transfer code before, but when I tried entering it to the new phone, system mentioned the code was already used. I'm unable to return from my previous account. I hope dev will develop to link account to either google (for androids) or social media like fb etc."
It's so much fun to play it's a really good game only problem though is the summon rates are god awful I can't summon a single five star unit
"Deliberately delayed their emails so that the refund would fail even when I told them that Googles refund site was having issues and needed their assistance, this game has the worst possible customer server the customer is always wrong and their rates are total rubbish."
Pulled summer Altria off a single. Basically beat the game.
"Been stuck in the purgatory known as re-roll hell for 10 hours now. Played the JP before too. Don't try this at home kids. 10/10 Would recommend this addiction of a game xD Current time: Still playing it, even spending money now. Send help. Edit: It is now the year 2021, had a couple mini hiatuses here and there due to the frustration of being F2P. I have now ascended and reached dolphin levels of spending. Still addicted. Engine is getting a tad dated tho, the game could use some revamp."
I love it. Specially the actions for the NP of each servant so i get to see something different everytime.
"Good game. But it is a gacha type game. U don't have to spend money, but it helps."
Game is nice but the rates are always as low as ever üòê
"Great Story, Huge Fanbase"
App wont launch normally anymore
This thing gave me Gil without whaling
Takes too long to summon as a Free to play player
5 STARS FOR GENDERBENT HISTORICAL FIGURES.FATE SERIES FAN SINCE 2006 SABER ROUTE TIL THIS DAY.I HOPE I CAN GET 5 STARS IN EVERY GACHA ROLL FOR MY REVIEW..
Love the characters and the story. Only issue is the gacha rates are abysmal. Be sure to save up if theres a character u want
I have been playing this game for a long time I enjoy it. But some changes need to occur for instance adding a pity system For summoning servants. Some sort of auto play feature Or at the very least some skip tickets. I like the game a lot but at some points playing it get a little daunting at times. One more point I would like to make is that this game is not a pvp game So let servants be more accessible through summoning.
4 star because why not?
"Decent game play with a long, enjoyable story"
Medea is best girl
A pretty good game to sink hours (and money) into. The grind for some of the ascension materials can take some time making the mid and endgame a bit time consuming but thats a minor detail.
I like it very much thank you for making a game to my favorite anime of all time. Best anime and game ever!!!
Makes me suffer but I keep coming back
Got my account back and want to thank the team for being patient and helping me recover my account
Lost my account never gonna get that back since it deletes the password for your account after one data transfer
"Its a great game, good story line and tons of cute waifus and husbandos. Gameplay is also good over all great game"
"Played this game for several years now, and it's still something I continue enjoying. It's not perfect, the visuals are dated, the gameplay can be tedious, especially with modern event requirements, and how much grinding they force on you to finish them in a time crunch. The game however has an excellent story, surpassing other fate games in fact, even despite earlier chapters being subpar relatively speaking. The gacha system is among the most brutal, and could be improved. Despite this 5/5."
"Pros -Very good story, sub-stories and aftermath -Many good events with its own story plot -It uses historical figures as characters so there is something you can learn -Strategic somehow -There are also budget OP servants that can help you progress a lot in case you can't get any SR's and SSR's Cons -Some animations, cards and sprites are quite old -It's very hard to get SSR's in the game and one 10x roll cost $15 so it's expensive -No cinematics exept for the intro/lostbelt Game is great to me"
üò§üëç
This game is really awesome for real!!!
"It has the worst gacha rates of all the games of the same genre. No guaranteed, no nothing. No auto farm, everything takes forever."
"This game is more story heavy with a side of waifu/husbando bait. At first few stories were OK/some bad, but they improved as you progress the game. It's not Pay 2 Win rather it's Pay 2 Waifu, you don't need those 5 stars units to finish different quests or nodes as the free servants like 1 - 3 star can do the same thing as a 5 star one. If you're into turn-based battles, story-based game, and an avid fan of history and historical figures then this game is for you"
IMPROVE YOUR GATCHA SYSTEM!
this game beautiful but i cant get more servants but im having fun with this game hope nice events too!!
I hate when Everytime I update this game It always don't wanna update
Plzzzz fix this summoning rate up itss sooooooo mad to get ur favorite servant and not event one or even a servant can't get plzzz fix ur summoning rate I hate it
They keep improving the experience and the events are always fun.
"It's okay for your first gacha... because it'll desensitize you to whatever is the worst to expect. If you've played pretty much any other profiled gacha game out there, this will always have something lacking."
"It's gacha so if you can't handle gacha games don't play this, otherwise great game. Especially the story"
"Terrible gatcha rate but a fun game even for free to play. The drop rate for upgrade materials make it a VERY heavy grind. If you like the Fate series, you may like this game. Edit: I HAVE LOST RESPECT FOR THIS GAME. I wont tell you how much I have spent, but this game is essentially a casino with extreme greed on part of who ever decides summoning rates. The game play is fun, but the Servant summon rate is so abysmal i can't recomend spending money on this game. Spent 1000 SQ, no 5‚òÜ servant"
"ever since I started playing this game, our household has never run out of salt. culinary experts should try"
its ok i guess
This is my most played and favorite gacha game. I also hate it so much.
I love it!
"Cool game, this the best gacha game i everplayed"
GOATED
After a system update the game launches to a black screen where when I tap there are sparkles but it never goes to the title card. On a motorola g stylus
Noble phantasm
"Gameplay is quite outdated, but exceeds every other gacha game in terms of characters, story and lore. However, that alone is enough to keep me playing until the very end. Remember: singles > multis"
"I really hope this game continues after lostbelt, very good"
"I have played video games for years until I found this game. Fantastic storytelling, and the animation is beautiful!"
It cool if you don't have nothing to play you can play this
"I having a blast playing this game, and the service they provide is amazing."
Wow I'm crying rn I lost my hard working account cause of the one use account transfer like please fix that and let it be infinite like I just lost all my hard work and characters and now no longer want to play it cause of the difficult rng for characters can I have my account back pleaseee.
Outdated need more attention by the developers
Good but gacha is ugh...
Hack every where
Waiting for Skadiiiii!!!! Edit: did not get skadiüò≠üò≠üò≠ Kama came home!!! Let's goooooo!!!~\(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)/~
Up rate summons or pity system
"The game is great but not for everyone. First of all you got to remember this game is gacha the drop rates for 5 and 4 stars are low but not non-existent (unless it's a five star). Everything can be earned through grinding and saving for characters you want. But when you get around that fact the game features a really good story and set of characters. But the story really begins to pick up after the 4th, 5th, and 6th story parts."
"Gacha Gods gave me what I wanted after I paid money, materials are a pain to get for ascension."
Love the game to death. That's all really
I like sicard and emiya
"Hmmmm yes everything is normal except for the gacha it's too dangerous to be alive, too salty, and dangerous for your wallet, it has some disease called simp, whale, etc and yes I hate and love this game though its killing my wallet but overall it's no pay to win"
Grind order
You really need to make data recovery easier
I totally dig it
Love the game but gacha is hell ;-;
Interesting battle system. Good art. But no auto battle is a personal deal breaker. If that doesn't bother you than this is worth a try.
"I'm glad I got rid of this app, it's like gambling but with no regulation and for a png instead of actual money. So it's worse"
Trouble where that I can find data transfer because I lost my!!! New : I hope my saving date still alive only if I know my [I D DATE]....
It is a fun turn based game that has a fun gacha system
gave me enkidu with a free summon ticket :>
Game is a 100 rate
I've been s player since 2017
Its great
One of the best gacha games out there
This game is p2w. All summon banners drop rate are so low i have been summoning 30 times still can pull either 4 or 5 star servants. Not recommended for new players.
The chances of getting a good servant is SO LOW. You can't get any good ones without spending cash
Good game no pity
Only in it for the lolis. Make it easier to get them
The absolute best game of this genre and I'm not sayin1g that just because I love the fate series
If your a fate fan than you might like it
I play this game solely to see cool stuff. Don't gacha your life away.
It's a great game with an awesome story.
Lots of waifus. Too bad the gacha rate is bad and there's no e-mail account binding so you can easily lose your progress.
There is no justice in the world of gacha
Pay to win money pit
The game is so damn addictive and the characters dont get me started yo!! But when it come to pulling servants it sucks burning the end I'm happy on what I have
Damn this game so good i cant stop grinding
"10/10 Customer Service, if you lost your account. Staffs got your back! 1-3 days your account will be recovered, some game staffs/devs may take 1 week or so. NICE 10/10 CUSTOMER SERVICE! Gonna buy a couple of SQ, if I got a new device. Hail FGO!"
This game is very good except the gacha. Balance for whale and f2p
Great game just improve the gacha rates
That is hell you are walking into
"Nice game but can u add some links acc in fb or etc. And the add some auto play so even I watch anime, eating, or doing something i can stay my phone"
How dare you make Babylon this long
Nothin to say it's just an awesome game
Failed to connect to server
It's a decent game if you like the Fate franchise but It's a gacha game so be prepared to either not get the character you want or be prepared to spend a lot of money to get them.
"Been playing for a year and I stopped after , the story is nice but overall it's monotonous and the events requires a lot of time."
The best Gacha Game I've ever played as a f2p
"I've been playing this game for almost two years and I've come to realize that the markers of this game don't care at all about their customers. Gameplay-wise I enjoy the game and I'll probably continue to play it, but I wouldn't recommend it to others. I've opened three customer support tickets and they all got the same response: ""We apologize if this resolution does not meet your expectations."" They don't provide any details, ask any questions, or offer any solutions. They don't care."
Stop
"Great Game, but I would like to play it with a clear conscience when it is released in all regions of the Play Store, not just NA."
"Really well made gacha game and a good way to pass my free time on my phone. I've had really no issues with it yet and if I did have issues it was due to poor network data or not clearing the cache when the issue arose and I reopened the app. I feel the amount of quartz they give is really nice for beginners although you may not roll what you want at the start and won't want to go through the hassle of rerolling. In the end, it's my favorite mobile game now and I play it a lot, I recommend it!"
I cannot play it said failed to connect to server
Gacha is a nightmare
"So if you're salty from being unlucky lemme share something special with ya'll...if you go over to the FP gacha and happen to roll a 3 star servant or fou (or 2 star command code, or 5 star exp ember), quickly switch over to the SQ banner and THEN make a few single rolls or a 10 roll....good luck c;"
I love fate. Fun to play!!
Worst thing I've ever experienced
I lost my password but I still know my ID so could I request for a password reset?
I despise the gacha system but i love the story of fgo so im gonna give it a 3. Update: loving the story so im increasing this to 4. Keep it going fgo <3
Hi im having a problem logging in I even clear cache and reinstall the game but it just won't load please fix this...
"Sadly my account got deleted, is there anyway i can recover my old account? Thank you"
Good over all
Poifect
"Stupidly repetitively long rerun events accompanied with unreasonable low gacha rates makes for such a boring a terrible game, sometimes playing this game just makes me feel like I'm a hamster on a wheel the game is more of a chore than actual fun."
Bring the arcade version on console or on mobile already for heaven sake.
"As a gacha gamer, this game stills hits different from the rest in a wonderful way. I recommend the game."
"I have been playing this game for over 2 years now and want to just say that, despite its terrable gacha rates, is one of the few best gacha games out there to play. I have sunk a lot of time and money and haven't really regret most of it. The game is satisfying and honestly f2p friendly. It doesn't spam you with ads to spend more money, nothing is pay walled, and the game gives you viable f2p servants to use, some of them being better than their ssr counter parts. Just try this game out."
"I transfered my data to a new phone for my English FGO. Last night I had to update the game and once I did, I started the game and it made me start a new game. I closed out the app and went in again and pressed on the Data transfer. And I tried to use my data transfer ID I got from my old phone and used my Password but it didn't work and said the transfer number is in used already and now I see that the transfer number can only be used once per transfer? I didn't know that, pls help 4 years gone"
Been playing for a little less than a year now and I've been enjoying it alot. Very f2p friendly and the events are really fun. The community is usually pretty helpful as well.
"Let me say that I love this series but this nonsense takes ""gacha"" to a stupid bad level it is mathematically IMPOSSIBLE to pull the same ""5 star"" craft essences back to back in the same 200 plus pulls but they seem fit to keep throwing this at us like a slot machine were you'll never get anything to a certain pay out. DO NOT PAY MONEY THEY ARE ROBBING YOU!!! ITS NOT RANDOM ITS NOT A CHANCE ITS NOT A NUMBERS GAME ITS GIVE ME 300 BUCKS AND ILL GIVE YOU PRETTY PICTURE THAT DOES NOTHING IN GAME!!!"
Fun but it gets boring.
Great gacha game
500 rolls and counting without seeing a single gold servant. Put in a real pity system for the love of god.
gacha salt
"Love this game, I have pretty decent luck on here unlike a lot of other games I play. Although my friend has terrible luck on here haha. Like 800 saint quartz and still didn't get their character bad.. lol. All in all leveling them is quite grindy with a low drop rate but it's still worth that final ascension and I keep coming back for more. I do suggest you start with a character you like, it's repetitive and a pain to keep resetting but that's how I started with my Emiya‚ù§Ô∏è"
Love the story and its friendly with free to play player
I hope all pilipino play this gamesüáØüáµüáµüá≠
I haven't even play the game yet it is taking years to loadüò†üò†üò†üò†üëéüëéand this game looks so coolllll
This game is amazing I'm so addicted. I was never really into the fate series until this game.
Good game 5 yer of playing
I got Meltryllis. Good game.
It's fun and good
I want to keep playing but I seriously cannot stand the huge cost of summons and than you have to deal with this absurd craft essence mixed with your heroic spirit chances that are SO SO SO LOW there is rare and than there is not even fun anymore I've restarted this game 3 times on 3 different phones over the years and get pisses off and quit everytime because just getting a 4star heroic spirit is so unlikely. I'm angry and upset again and it makes me horribly sad because I love fate.
It's nice
I can't access the story mode for some reason but I can access everything else please tell me what's going on
"improve gacha rates and more rewards, buce story if u love fate, great graphics and gameplay, needs more players.6.9/10. reduce loading time. nice character designs, top notch game but needs more QoL, needs pity."
Transfer issue really bad authentication method. I losed my account after transfer to emulator. Developers please change auth method using google play games or facebook using oauth
Good! But worst gacha but thats fine the main issue is theres no auto when you're farming its quite boring to repeat the same thing all over again please add an auto
Trash game trash rates
Fun Great story line
BIG OPPAI
Horrible customer service. I've been locked out of my account for weeks and they refuse to help me out. Told them information only i have access to and they still won't help.
"I downloaded this a year ago hoping that I could play it but when I open it, it was always in loading screen and I waited and it says failed to connect to server I retry and retry and restart but it is not working please fix that"
Great game just wish they boosted 5 star drop rates
"A good enough substitute for Magia Record. It is rather cool that many of the heroes are famous historical or literary characters, but I still think Magia Record was better. I miss magireco. Edit: So I see a lot of reviews complaining about the gacha rate, and I don't know if they fixed it or something, but I've only been playing for a month and I already have seven 4+ star heroes. Just my experience, take it or leave it."
"I enjoy playing it. It's just that when the game was accidentally erased from the phone & wasn't able to get your transfer code, it's hard to retrieve your account because the support team won't even respond to you when you message them for you to retrieve your account. So if you are lucky, you'll be able to get your account back. If not, you'll just start from zero again, losing the servants that you already had."
M A G N I F I C E N T
Worst gacha system ever¬°!!!!¬° I haven't got any SSR this year!!!!!
Its a really good game and all I hope is that it keeps getting better thank you aniplex
Entertaining.
What can I say about this game?... idk cause it just never loads and nearly crashes my entire phone. Fortunately others don't seem to have this problem.
"Amazing game, Good story and gacha system is bit too much but still lobe this game."
Make the Rate Ups better!!!
Gacha hell is real...
Save for skadi. Edit: got skadi. Save for castoria.
"im a fan of fate so i'll play it regardless but the gameplay is simple yet complex but the gacha is well hell, its a fun time killer but spend too much i question you."
Fun time waster that gets you into the Fate universe.
"Been playing for over a year now, if you love the fate series this is the best and it's canon"
Atrocious Rates
Addicted to it
"People will complain about all sorts of stuff about this game but the fact of the matter is: If you enjoy the fate series' story and it's characters from all corners of it, you will probably enjoy this game. My only major gripe is that I wish there were more opportunities to earn the saint quartz. If you aren't wise with it and get ""gamble-happy"" , you will find yourself in a bind at some point. I wish I could write a longer review about it because it's actually a fun game if you let it be."
Breathtaking
10 out 10 would get salty.
TYPEMOON stans baba booey
Hard to get good characters
Gacha rates are so low.
Amazing gameüòç
I like it but you need to put mission that gives at least 2 quarts per mission and you guys need to add a auto fight option or farming gets anoying
This game slaps! I play everyday.
"It's 2021 but fgo is still lagging behind every single gacha games, no improvement nothing, abysmal rate up, no QoL update, most artwork is ugly save for a few, they are popular because of fate franchise, without that name this game is nothing, DW is lucky"
Game c·ªù b·∫°c v·ª´a r√°c v·ª´a r√°ch n√™n cho 5 sao
"Everything is cool the story and the gameplay, everthing was fine except for the gacha"
"Awesome game! Loved the story & characters. The game is also educational about history, mythodology, and legends, which I greatly like. And as an ftpp, I luckily got many SSR servants from the Gacha rolls. And my favorite ones too, at that! One of the best friendly mobile games out there! You just have to have patience when playing, and the game will blessed you."
Well it doesn't matter now I got better servants by luck
rerun every welfare servant please
May the God of Gachas bless this game
Its a good game honestly but the fact that people have wasted over 500+ saint quartz to get a charater makes you realize that its bit heartless at least make it so after 10 x10 summons you are guaranteed one of the or the 5star of the banner
Waste of money tbh
"Ok, The Gacha will be very confusing to use and utilize on especially this far in the story in case of beginners. Still, utilize the overpowered lostbelt servants regardless the rarity. They will carry you to the... well... lostbelt chapters."

Pretty bad rates. No pity. Story is ok but has been going downhill since the second Liz Event. Skip button is your friend. The characters are nice but totally not worth it unless you're rich and like type moon.
Kapitalism
Drop me Saber and Gilgamesh plssssssssss üò´üò´üò´
Great story once you get into it and really enjoyable characters. The events are also a fun break from the main story that provide with a lot of valuable resources and enjoyment.
Hot dog
Love this game a lot
Rate up is a lie and wish the content wasn't 2 years old. 1:1 with jp needs to happen.
A great game with fantastic characters.
Love the story but I wish there was better rates.
Cash grab
Rate up is a lie...
Really great game. So much fun to play. Good story modes and awesome characters. captivative enough to draw any new fans of the game and fate universe.
My first 4 months I already have 3 5 stars servant.
Love the game lack of pity system is a problem but the story and characters make up for it
Goldüëå(help me)
I love this game so much and I love the story each singularity. I just rate this four star because I don't have that much luck to get Zhuge Liang on his banner. Will rate this 5 star when I finally get Merlin and Zhuge Liang.
Show mercy
Very strategic game love it.
"Although FGO is a game with summon rates for SSR's can put a drain on you, it has wonderful music, characters, and story that made me poor my time into this game."
Love the game. Love the series. 4 stars because I still don't agree with Craft Essences being bunched together with Servants in the gacha. I wish it was a separate gacha on its own.
"I'd give 5 stars for its great stories and lovable characters But as a ""game"" it fails in every aspects. Imagine doing chores (all those boring gameplay) in order to read a novel. Not really worth it IMHO."
"Great side scroll simulator, only came at the low cost of my soul"
i had a house before
It's soo good. But in the next update pls add the data transfer to sd card fiture
"I love the fate series, that's the reason why I play this. But this game kinda gets boring overtime and the gacha is brutal. No pity system, it sucks and outdated compared to other gacha games."
Will sell a kid for the wife
Its really friendly fo F2P players its easy to summon. If you dont get 5star servants you get good 4 star or 5 star Craft Essence.
"Game has a good story, but the gacha system is greed at its finest. Abyssmal rates with no kind of pity system. You can spend thousands and get nothing. Low tier rarity 1-3* is only viable to clear story content at most up to early Lostbelt Arc. Free 4* range from meh to decent. In other words it is F2P friendly up to a certain point. If you like to whale in gacha, you're better off playing Genshin Impact if you want your money's worth. Gameplay is repetitive and farming is time consuming."
"This game is amazing, get it."
Kinda bad rate ups
This has so many different classes and a big story and I love
Best game ever played its fun to play
"Love this game, i waited for almost 2 to 3 years to finally get it. Still loving it thus far!!!"
"The characters and story might be great, but the lack of pity system and quality of life sure isn't. Without any pity whatsoever, you can find yourself spending thousands upon thousands and never getting what you want. There's no auto-repeat function for battles, which makes farming ridiculously tedious. The game also lacks the ability to skip NPs which are a waste of time to watch after the 100th time. Frankly speaking, if you take the story out, the gameplay is quite repetitive and boring."
Very fun playing experience.
Mga potang ina nyo sinira nyo ang araw ko mga hayop kayo 100 plus sq tapos paid 4750 K tang ina kahit ssr lang isa hindi pa nakakuha mga potang ina nyo wla kayong mga kwenta hindi man lang kayo mahiya
Too slowpaced and expensive
"If you forget your user name, transfer code, friend code the is no point redownloading this game because the save date is terrible so if you uninstall this game and didn't write down any this you will not have your account back. And any money you spent would of been wasted for nothing."
Rating it 5 stars because i want to get 5 stars
"Bad Costumer Service! I try to recovery my account but they didn't let me. They keep asking for first email, even I already provide correct detail of account & purchase receipt... did they blind or what ?"
as a fatetard this is one of the best games ever please localize fate extra record in the US
I only came here for Astolfo
sometimes almost 4 years no new servants sometimes it doesn't feel like i used to play anymore due to that skipped a lot of banners and rolled kama doesn't get anything as well in ereshkigal banner sometimes it's quite hard to roll you favorite servant which is extremely low rate of getting sometimes singles are not enough
Great Game. Thank You!
It would be nice if you could add a auto function if not a skip the battle function if your that much stronger one of these espeshilly auto and I'd easily rate 5*.
Trash mobage relic of the past. Play something better instead.
"It was great, the mechanics are good the story line is good, overall a very cool game"
Yes. Just. Yes.
DAMNNN 10/10
It's pretty good graphic as well
2.1k SQ spent now... not a single 5‚òÜ the rates are shown but the actual values remains unknown games clearly shady ASF not to mention that its stupidly manual and repetitive.
It was really fun
tbh honest i just watched both Fate Series for the first time and finished then but this is a let down you only get 1 star quarts per quest finish like EXUSE me that is bad and don't get me started on the bugs oh dear
Fun game been playing for years there are purchases available but you don't have to pay anything the game gives you a fair amount of things to make it so purchases aren't needed.
"Don't worry I don't hate the game , I'm just salty rn"
Goot but I think something is missing
Lost my account. Support didnt help at all. Even had proof of purchase but they just ignored my pleads. Play genshin
Fate grand order.
Welcome to the EA of mobile gaming.
My single all-time favorite mobile game. No auto battle. No PvP. No pay to win. Just the player and the game. Compelling story. Excellent art. Memorable characters. This one is worth your time and money.
Idk what to say
"Great game with a strange story, interesting plots, great themes, and eccentric characters. And a fun gameplay, of course. But it's a gambling game. And with too much fanservice! What the heck? And why half of the characters must be gender-swapped? I'm telling you, greed corrupts genuine art."
"The summoning for heroic spirits needs to be separated from the craft eccence and 4 and 5 star card drops need to be buffed or at least cut the cost of saint quartz in half, honestly ive dumped upwards of 300 dollars on this and im not getting a tenth of the enjoyment out of it that I'd get from a console game at half that price."
"This is a good game, it's just that I find it too much like pay to win. All the good characters that you want that can actually complete the higher level quests are like 0.13 or 0.43% and the crystals are not all that easy to get considering when you attack an enemy they do something called an ""overkill."" I would like it better if it either just stopped attacking the enemy so it goes faster, or just attack a different enemy. But over all this is a great Fate game, I love the game and the anime."
I couldnt find a way to save my account and lost all my data 4 times now it won't let me even lode
If u love the fate anime u will love this game. Updated is anyone experienced frozen from the loading of the next day midnight.
I love fate/Grand Ordernit the best
nice game i guess?
"The first few arcs are a bit rough, but once you clear that hump, it's legitimately one the best JRPGs out there, even with the gacha trash."
The Game is amazing and definate must have for any Type-moon/DelightWorks fan but it takes up alot of space (Gradually).
"I can't say the game is bad, I couldn't see anything the whole time everything was pink. I wanted to try it out, but I may be deleting it instead."
"Only way to get good pulls is to spend 100s, what a scam."
Please give me semiramis edit: they did give me semiramis thank you fgo :)
"Love the story , character designs and the music. I just hate how it lags sometimes and the gacha rates really suck."
"I really like all the characters, but after a while every fight feels the same."
"I've been playing this game for over 3 years, and the fact I'm still playing should say something. The art direction is great, the turn-based play is a perfect balance between pace and strategy, and the enhancement mechanic is logical and easy to pickup. The best thing about FGO is the stories. Some are funny, others surprisingly emotional and they are always compelling. You don't need to be familiar with the ""Fate"" universe to play, it can stand alone. If you dig RPG give it a go."
I have no life
"Love the way the game is setup besides, how you do one battle and waste all your ap. Its also good to see how older units are still good and continue to have longevity. Game is really creative especially with events and story."
Great game i love it i downloaded it and i cant stop playing it
I Just Love This
I have a lot of mixed feelings about Grand order but overall as a part of the Fate franchise I do greatly enjoy it.
An anime fan's favorite gambling experience.
Waifus and hentie
The lostbelt is pretty good
"I lowered the star because their drop rate Up isn't improving. I've already spent a lot. They only give CEs, no servants!!!"
Data won't download if internet connection is too slow !!!!
Love dem anime tiddies
give servant
I Love this game but I hate this game
Stella no jitsu
"Love the anime, love the game"
Love it! Play more than 2 years now.
I got Astolfo
I'm good now
Worst game
"Great game, can play without spending money, though obviously you can get more 5 stars if you do, but they aren't required to beat the content!"
Fun game but the rates are brutal
"A decent mobile game overall, with decent strategic gameplay, and good story. If you're a fan of any of the Fate franchise, had/has offered, or just like GACHA in general, then you'll love this game."
"The gameplay is fun and and doesn't get boring easily The story/plot is bland at first but after a while, the main story becomes awesome, not to mention the side stories (events) The game itself is not pay to win, so thats great. But this is a gacha game nevertheless, so get ready for some dissapointment in not getting the awesome characters that you want"
Great game! Especially fun if you're into the series as a whole.
I LOVE GILGAMESH
one of my favorite gocha games of all times
Lolis~
So after a nearly month I came back playing this game and it's still fun and enjoying but there's still a lot of bug happening while I am playing and a lot of times it's always freezing hopefully they fix it asap
It has a very good storyline and excellent gameplay
BEST. GAME EVER. but I do want more movement with the servants and pls update the noble phantasms. More angles and more movements pls
You will ONLY pull essences. You want 4 stars or 5 stars? Be a whale. An exaggeration? Yes. Genshin impact has better rates. Jk both are bad
"I love the franchise and the game, but the banner rate and sheer amount of fluff put into the banners is off putting. I only pull on 3 or 4 banners a year. The fact that I'm only likely to get 1 or none of the servents with that amount of quarts you can save in between plus purchased is crazy. I know that's how gacha games work, but most newer gacha have a pitty system guarenteed to get the unit if you have the resources to reach the pitty. I only play 2 gacha games, might be only 1 soon"
This game has the worst drop rates of any game and the games graphics feel so outdated. But thats what i love about it.
Best characters
Best game!!!!
"Game is very expensive and not forgiving. If you have problems with gambling, I wouldn't recommend this. I've spend over $600 on the game and I regret nothing. Money comes and goes but waifus are forever, or atleast until the game is still alive."
good game.
"great game,great story. best turn based rpg game out there"
Please make a pity system for gacha:'(
I take back what I said
The game is fun to play and it gives me knowledge about each servant
Using Bluetooth in a high end device is enough to freeze the app in any ascension process or minor cinematic during a fight and other cinematics in special events
A great game that rewards those who play it regularly.
"The events are worth hyping for,servant are top notch,and the storys are fantastic.The only issue is that it take a long time for jp content to be ported to N.A and gacha rate for servant.But all of the problem are worth playing the game for!"
I really like the whole perspective of the game and I like how the characters look as well
"DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE THIS GAME"
It's a good game with a good story also great music but ohh boy trying to unlock a new character is like trying to beat the casino at its own game I invested alot of time and unfortunately alot of money (in the four digit amount ü•∂) so I will say this out of my own experience to anybody willing to invest in this game careful with spending money on this game cause it will drain your bank and build a gambling addiction üòÜ
Gacha bad is civilization
I want saber
Best thing that a play with the fate series
5/5 would whale again
fix the dialogues in the early phases of the game
"Love it, but it needs qol improvements. Such as, skipping stages and repeat on exp, money and material stages, class sorting, instant rewards view after repeats/skips of stages. And increased drop rate"
"The story and characters is stellar and the gameplay on the later part of the game is really challenging, some of it are even more difficult than the Challenge Quests that is released with (probably) every events. It's not a secret that the gacha is in this game is horrible compared to other gacha games, but what makes this game better than the other gacha games is that you could still build a good party even as an F2P (myself as an example)."
tho indeed the STORY IS GOOD/BEST. BUT its full of garbage. the rateup is terrible and the gameplay is too old to be THAT expensive! dont play this if your pocket is empty!
"I've been playing for four years now, and the game has only progressed in quality and content. It's very much a time sink and grindy but I love it and the franchise."
"This thing is hell, run away but its a fun hell"
"Love the story, but each chapter comes very slowly..."
please increase the apple rewards sometimes we can't finish the event because of AP lacking
Previous problems from before? Fixed. Did they Make the game run a whole lot smoother and nicer? Happened. Do they give awesome updates and rewards for logging in? Easily do. Rating? 5 star.
A much better gacha game than any other I've played. Just the right balance of events and dead weeks.
Excaliber Morgan and burgers :T
I hate this game. 5/5
"An amazing game overall. Excellent music, writing, and animations. Stick with the story until Camelot; it vastly improves from there. The ga cha aspect is unforgiving but the game can be played with f2p units."
"I tend to delete this app for space but i always get sucked back in thanks to google targeting ads at me whenever there's a new event. Grindy, of course but still fun. Taught me how people can get addicted to these types of games. I've tried others of the same type but this is the only one that i keep coming back to."
"Good gameplay, great story, albeit you need to have an general understanding of the Nasuverse to fully enjoy this game. My only gripe, as with many other players, is the gacha system that makes it nearly impossible to get the character you want. Otherwise, a great game for the fans and can potentially draw in newbies to the series. Just beware spoilers to the main series, as this doesn't bother with warnings towards some of the characters."
Yeah it's okay.
"It's fate, it's great, I got best girl rin x2."
Control your wallet urges and you'll have a good time with waifu and husbandos
"Fun to play but cut up your credit cards and get rid of your PayPal because „Ääbleep„Äãme the drop rate is abysmal. I spent $290 on sq just to get Jalter after missing out for 3 years straight with saved SQ . This is gambling in game at its finest. Seriously. Try not to spend a dime on this because it gets easier and easier everytime you do it, now I just pay back my credit card to spin for servants..."
I'm addicted to this game.
Bruh the game is legit awesome. The hate are just about them not getting their waifus or husbandos . If you like lazy gaming maybe this isn't for you cause the game forces you to play and pay attention. Which is nice since this is a strategy turn base gacha game right?
"By now, we all know that gacha rate ups are a lie. Yet despite that, I absolutely fell in love with the visual novel aspect of it, the stories, the events, even the character dialogues you have in the My Room. I came here because it's Fate, but I stayed for the storylines (& gacha)."
Great game and the story is intriguing. Though I really hope that the gacha is improved. And please add more ways to obtain SQs and Tickets.
Gaming
So. Fun.
"Works great, and althought it feels outdated in its UI and combat system, it still holds as one of the greatest gachas out there."
"Game is really fun but so much content is time locked and the summon rates are absurdly low, I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone."
The game is awesome and the customer service also. If you want to experience a game with a good story I highly recommend this game.
This is a game for collectors who appreciate ALL characters and spending money is no guarentee. Also seems lik if u have technical issues give these guys a week to clear it up. Money fixed ASAP but technical issues can take a lil bit. Be more patient then I wasüòÖüòÖ
"Forced tutorial warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Do you like a boring tutorial? One that you can't skip? Here comes a forced tutorial that feels like a cactus up the rear. Or perhaps feels like a hedgehog did a nose dive down your throat. This game has so much hype yet hand holds you like you have 3 extra chromosomes. Boo! And yes I continued to play beyond the tutorial, the story has nothing going for it and this ""game"" is clearly a cash grab. Play something else fellow gamers."
Great game terrible gacha!
"Brutal game in terms of ability to get things, but not impossible to beat"
I like the game
"I love the game my friend suggested this game and I love it, but I want geronimo the caster 3 star dude to get reworked please I feel like he could have way better skills for a support 3 star servant thats goes for some other servants too so please see this and tell me if you will he deserves better"
Great game but my game accidentally crashes and my current data is now gone.And i cant remember my transfer code. Can yu help me recover my old account
L o l i
"Old and dated. The Global Server of this game is just a shadow of its Japanese server. The story is great, but the UI is quite lacking, the graphics in a battle is actually amazing, but the big downfall is the gameplay. If you have around 5 hours everyday to test your will and patience into mindlessly grinding characters or spend a few hundred bucks to gamble in the game, be my guest. Don't bother asking for improvements as the game strictly follows its original JP server(which is 2 years ahead)"
Past the time
Accidentally uninstalled the app without getting a transfer code is there anyway i can get my account back without starting over???
"This game has a great story, and the detail is crazy."
I wish jalter is my wife.
I just learned that the developers have no intention of ever adding any quality of life features which is frankly BS. The game is designed for people with no life who can play all day and thats ridiculous. Id love to play this game but i only play while im doing other things which is impossible to do with this game. Its a shame..
Its fun and I like how the gacha system works
True Waifu expirience
My wallet hates me
It's so fun this game I like it
Nice app
YESSIR
"Progressions way to slow! Doing the same mission several times to get one item is ridiculous. We all like the charters, but you only get a few forawhile that you'll like. Story takes place during the last season of the anime, which is ok, but i doubt is anyone's favorite. Gameplay is average tactics, without any auto feature for a game like this is odd."
Too good 0$ 100% happy
Addictively fun!
I like it but it takes a while to get new servant
"After grinding 30 of the stars, i decided to use them for a summon, only to get a bunch of essence and low star characters. These stars are a dollar a piece, if i had paid for them, that would feel like a total rip off"
ITS GOOD!
only spent 3 years and couple hundred $ on this game would gladly do it again for okita story's good too if you're into it
"Been playing since Oct. 2017. Overall great game if you love Fate. Yeah the gacha rates suck, but it's very F2P friendly. Gameplay can be grindy but also rewarding if you put in the time."
No pity system and too grindy.
"Straight to the point. The story is the best thing about the game. There is a ton of gender swaping in the game. The rates suck, it is 1% chance for a five star. About 120 limited servants and about 20 permanent ones. It's Stamina heavy game, takes months to max out one character or years. The music is good, the combat is slow pace with no skip/auto feature. Never a discount on saint quartzs ever. Events only happen twice and no more so if you missed the first and second that's too bad."
Already got her
Not recommended for people who still value their sanity
Awesome game. Wish they would make Saint Quartz farming quests though.
DASFAFDASF
Honestly really enjoy the game and for the most part i really dont have any complaints but the lack of a pity system really hurts. The last time I pulled a five star that wasnt from a guaranteed banner was around march 2020 and I usually summon on most banners that come out.
"Good game with great story, fantastic voice acting and servant interaction rate up is a lie of course so if you want to get your favorite servant pray to RNGesus but still its a great rpg"
"Would reccomend to a TYPE MOON fan with no time for visual novels but just enough time for casual play, wants to see and use various characters. Gameplay is repetitive with grinding if, but becomes a tad bit easier when you have raised you servants to higher levels, what would you expect it is a gacha game. Overall, the story is littered with generic, weird, wacky and charming character interactions."
"Game is Great overall. You don't need to spend money (Unless you really want some particular sr or ssr waifu or husbando, then get your wallets ready or just pray to RNGesus or do both.) to clear it's content and etc. Everything can be basically solved by weeks or months of grinding (which is a huge part of the game if you ask me). Anyways Imma head off with my f2p np3 summer jeanne. 3 turn farm go brrrrrr"
"This game is definitely not geared towards Free To Play. Even after two years and literally hundreds of hours playing, I still have issues with passing some basic content. I love the Fate franchise, but I'm done with this iteration of it, I'll just watch the numerous anime if I want my fix. If you are a whale, and have hundreds of dollars to spend... Maybe this is for you, but it's far too frustrating for ftp"
Very good app
so far its fun
"play it for the story, nothing else is of value"
Meh game
best gacha game edit: it got boring when genshin arrived
What the hell is a gacha?
"Gameplay loop is unique to other gachas and quite addicting. Every servant is viable as this is strictly PVE, thus there is no emphasis on stupid luck or stupid spending. The game is quite generous free rewards and frequent events. Not only that, but the story is also quite good. This game is the whole package and easily the best Gacha I have played."
"Rate up is a lie, still best game for best bois"
It's an awesome game and I enjoy playing it üòÄ. But I'm really starting to hate gachaüò°. Other than that awesome gameüòé.
Best game all time that i played
"Like all gacha games, beware of GAMBLING ADDICTION--it could seriously hurt you irl! CRUEL premium gacha rates. Super attack (Noble Phantasm) animations are LONG and UNSKIPPABLE. Ultimately pretty free-to-play friendly--I've collected very good units without spending a cent. Story quality is hit or miss in the beginning, but starts getting good at the end of the 1st arc. I'm told that the few yearly Guaranteed paid gachas are the best use of real-life cash. I'm F2P btw."
The game was quite fun since i always love the fate series that only thing that makes this game a little bit awful is the gatcha system like lol even if you play this game for years you won't have any single ssr servant and also i take took much time to play a single quest like 1-3 minutes or more to load the game it would been even better is the loading screen is fast.
"Don't get me wrong, I love both Type-Moon as a franchise and this game, but there's a lot of flaws that make it difficult to recommend. For instance, there's nothing to do outside of the turn-based combat, no base building like in other gacha games, and the gacha system itself has drop rates so low it's borderline predatory. Plus, starting the game later puts you at a disadvantage because so much content is time-gated and temporary."
Give me good luck.
Very good game in general but connection is funky sometime
GACHA ruin my life
Thanks. I enjoy it
Always been the game that i reinstall over and over again haha! Love love love the well written story and characters especially the art <3
"So okay, if you play this game for fun, then just do it. However, if this game makes you depressed and even affects your life, stop playing."
It's lit üî•
"Its a great game in which it gives me a review about historical figures & stuff with a different twist. Though as a person who play this game for nearly 2yrs, I'd like to have the developers take note about having SSRs a lil bit forgiving at some point aside from spending too much money for a low gacha rate. Like somewhat make it forgiving on Free to Play people out there who just wants to enjoy the game and collect their favorite servants as their achievement & trophy..."
It's really good game. Even low stars servants are useful if you are skilled enough.
I love the game but can't help feeling ripped off due to you giving new players 28 quartz stars when I started I only got 10 so I think you guys should make it to where the people who have had it get something as well. NVM I got a five star and chloe in the magical girl event
I've been playing for a few years. I have a few 5 star characters but the drop system can be a bit of a pain. Love the story and the characters.
Fun characters and story
No explanations. I just love it.
Gacha system is kind of rough (no pity rate) but other than that it's a really fun game.
"Very behind in the mobile gacha scene. No pity, no auto, extremely low pull rates for 5 stars."
I can't stop playing.
Finally finished the colab SERAPH storyline(didn't make it last time). LOVE IT üíû Really wish able to play(@ finish) the Melty/lip/BB route at PSP
Amazing. Just amazing
The game is awesome but the space needs to be toned down like fate JP. JP takes like 1.50gb and this is taking 4.56gb
I recommend Genshin impact over this games Idea of a summon system
I didn't initially like FGO. I thought the card combat was dated even when it first released. I just find all of the characters compelling. There's a certain charm that's developed when I've been with these characters in an unravelling story for a few years as everyone plays a role in the story. I have issues with the friend support system as it gives me anxiety. I don't have the meta caster supports due to the gacha not having a pity system and no one uses my roster as a result. Kinda sucks.
The gameplays fun. The gacha is hell. The lancer is dead. 4 stars.
"Doesn't work. I get a screen telling me it's a work of fiction, and that's all. It just stays at that screen. To the person complaining that the rates are inaccurate, a 1/100 chance is not a guarantee that you will get that thing 1 time if you try 100. Each attempt has a 1/100 chance. So that 100th try is still just a 1/10p chance. Only going up to 200 tries is not enough to test it. Take it up to 1000 and see what results you get."
"Pain and suffering Gacha? gacha gacha, gacha!"
"Game is nice, it's just that it is very hard to get a 5 star character"
10/10 game of the year all years
Ehh... its good ig
The game is fun but the only thing i find tidius is the low rate for fou star and five star heroes there are almost none existent agter playing the game for 3 months or so i only manage to get at least 3 four star heroes and 3 five stars
Story
I love this game and i hate this game
Love It!
Enjoyable game but the gacha rates are a lie and some of the events are boring and hard to progress but the game mechanics and art styles are lovely.
DW KONTOL
Lol gacha hell
A*
If you guys love the Fate series then you'll love this game.
"The characters are amazing and that's all. The gameplay is repetitive there is no auto battle, there is no pity like other gacha game, and switching accounts from one phone to another is such a pain."
"The only thing I hate about this game beside the heavy grinding for gem and fragments is for the fact that the servant's attacks can be used as an aoe but is still single damage, for example scathach-skadi her np card attack is definitely aoe but still single target"
"Good game, ho- good servants, good story."
One of the best games I ever had in my opinion.
"The Game is Very Fun and Enjoying for myself and the Developer actually interact to the Player like me, Who Experience some Account Problem i just Contact them by Email and they Respond not like to other game developer who just ignore it. I recommend it to play. THIS GAME WILL TEST YOUR GRINDING SKILL OR BEING A TRYHARD PLAYER, Especially when you're a F2P player like me."
"Amazing Game, and it actually fun to grind in the Game"
amazing.
"3.5/5. The story is excellent, same with the voice acting and visuals, but the gacha is the worst experience I've ever had. Flat 1% default SSR rate, without any real pity system, and even that is split between units (which you want five copies of) and equipment (also want five copies). While low-rank cards can be leveled and carried forward, there's an obvious power difference vs. new gacha rolls. Very fun if you don't mind that, but infuriating if you enjoy rolling and getting new units."
I enjoy the game cause of many waifus and exciting story lines
"A gacha down to its core but full to the brim with enough waifus and husbandos that you can forget your problems. Just please, for the love of God don't spend money on saint quartz."
"To be honestly, FGO has the best storyline of all gacha game I have ever played. I guess they have a lot of experience in writting story since fate stay night in 2004. The characters are really charming. I gotta say this game is the best. If you think this game is p2w, then it is not. You can beat the entire game without the need of 5 star servants. So you can completely play the games for free. The only downside is the gacha rate is really low. But that is how every gacha game go so yea."
Its good
"Great story, has an anime, has a movie. A successful game. The people who give this a low rating are just salty. They didn't get their waifu. 1 tix 1 ssr f2p btw!"
"Over 1000sq for no ssr, no one"
"I love the story, great characters and animations, I just wish getting ascention materials and level up materials was easier and also increased rates for 4 stars because I'm tired of using all my Saint Quartz and tickets just to get trash. Other than that I think it's a great game."
I don't know I never got to play it would never finish downloading
Summon rng is awful game play is fun so 3/5
Fun game with a good story.
Good game sometimes it's a lil slow but I love this game it could throw a lil high grade servants though
Good gameplay and visuals but to big update sizes
"The only slightly positive aspect of this game is the story. Otherwise, everything is garbage and outdated compared to modern gachas. The gacha is also one of the worst on the market. It is not okay to save for months in anticipation of your favorite character and spend the equivalent of hundreds of dollars in summoning currency only to leave empty handed. I will never support this game again and I highly advise you to stay away from the app or do not spend a penny."
You can find better gatcha games.
"I used to quite enjoy this game, but through a mishap I lost all of my progress all of my servants and was told there's absolutely no way for retrieving them. So therefore my review is still a five stars but I'm disappointed."
I love it adorable an gameplay about Fate/GO
"The game's storyline is great especially at the lostbelts, good animations and battle system. However, the rate of summoning are kinda wonky and might make it kinda untrusty especially for F2P players."
"I really enjoy the game but i wish there was a way to save our progess like through facebook, i paid in this game and i don't wish to loose the progess because i uninstall the game, could you add a facebook or something we cna use to transfer?"
Yay
Strategy
"Fantastic RPG. Be warned, the gacha rates are brutal."
"Fun game, take the wins when you can and don't get too salty with the gacha system. I've been playing almost since day 1 and have never stopped playing."
Still my favourite ever since release
It gives me big PP playing this game.
"Been a fan of Fate ever since the release of UBW, I actually played this just for my waifu mordred but ended up getting addicted to the gacha. Anyways a very good game."
Its an enjoyable time sink of a gacha game that'll get you thinking about alternate realities and alternate histories the more you collect your favorite waifus of the week.
"Very expensive pay to play model, very stingly with currency and no summon pitty system. Pay hundreds/thousands for a single character or don't bother. Graphicly it isnt very good compared to other gacha games like Genshin or epic7. Gameplay is very boring, it's very grindy and repetitive, no autoplay, very little strategy, long loading times, requires you to read long, boring stories to participate in most events. Unless you are a diehard fate fan, avoid this game, try epic7 or genshin impact."
Its the best game to past the time way i say 100 out of 100 i would recommed to anyoneüòÅüòÅ
This game is a lot of fun and a leads to a ton of interesting wiki rabbit holes. Definitely an awesome game to play!
"Awesome game, the story is long and packed with action. The Sevants are just the best, the summonings are very unpredictable so, I hope the best of luck to you! Finally the events are great for my favorite anime series ever."
hate gacha. love fate.Gacha bad civilization. Terrible customer service.
I like Mordred :). Wish I could bring her home though :'(
"Love it!! This game is Good Civilization. I have over 20 SSRs, so I can't complain about drops for real. And then I tried to summon Tamamo and everything changed....."
If we tone down grinding a little bit then I think this game can get 5 stars.
I have enjoyed the story and characters as well as the gacha aspect
Enjoyable but a little too grindy for a gacha game
I love your game 100
I'll just say the best gacha game. If your fan of the fate series you'll absolutely love this and it's f2p friendly. I absolutely recommend this game.
"I've been playing this game for about a year and a half. It offers excellent character design and interesting and fun missions. There is a constant stream of new events, as well as a revival of older events. It is frustrating when I do not reach requirements needed to participate in an event, but I use that time to clear main quests and unlock the event hen it gets revived. Grinding to upgrade characters can sometimes be exhausting, but it really feels great when your character's skills are lv10"
The game is a great time killer and I enjoy the grind. 10/10
Mong c√≥ ti·∫øng Vi·ªát
"I got super far in the game, i had lots of event exclusive characters and all because the account recovery process lagged for a while i lost all of my work and around $5000, ive been playing on a new account for long enough that my previous complaints are mostly null, asside from the fact that there is no way to go back and see parts of the story youve already seen"
Only mobile game I play I'm either a loser or..... Oh there's nothing else I can be
ONLY GILGAMESH HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL ME MONGREL!!!
"Game is good. I'm soley F2P but I've gotten good servants. I've enjoyed my experience with it, but I will say the gacha rates are kinda low compared to to other gacha games on here."
i am the bone of my salt
"I played this game for a year now. While this game has quality animation and voice acting, i don't recomend it: 1)Gatcha has a probability of disappointing you to the point of despair (imagine farming SQ for 1year and not getting ur waifu) 2)95% of time spent are just farming 3)Skipping event welfare servants can make your way so difficult. 4)Significant updates will reach to NA after 2 whole years 5)Not dolphine-friendly but whale-friendly 6)has been getting less players since genshin impact"
"Takes W A Y too long to lvl up characters, and has a very pay-to-win feel, but cute characters and interesting story so still fun, definitely a grinder game"
If you want your wallet and heart to burn
"Great story, love the events, lots of grinding but not that bad."
"genuinely pretty good game! The rates are awful & there's nothing resembling a spark/pity system, and I would not call delight works generous but. Some great stories, fantastic characters, generally pretty engaging team building & gameplay and recent characters animate very well. Overall fun time"
"it's been 3 years. i play fgo kinda late tho, I started play when saber wars event was on. It was very amusing and fun in someways l. tho i read Fate/ franchise to know this game. I very recommend this game to a hard core fans of Fate/ series. if you doesn't like story based game then go play others gacha game"
"Imagine being in 2021 with low rates, no pity and/or no real guarantee draw pick system"
"Been playing for a couple of years now. Got into it because of the Fate series. The gameplay starts off straight forward but as you move through the story it quickly escalates and you do need to consider team composition. Main story is the serious business but the events are just fun. There is gacha and all I can say is ""May the odds be ever on your favor."""
"Oh mighty and all powerful gacha! We give praise and our thanks! And we pray for blessing and mercy Lest we suffer your terrifying wrath For we are a gacha fearing people. Yes, gacha, we fear your awesome and tremendous power the most. Please shed grace upon your unworthy children... This we pray. Amen."
"The story is great, but it did get repetitive sometimes. The gameplay, that is."
Played this a few months ago and it was great but I had to uninstall it for space. Now that I have it installed again it wouldn't even let me in. It fails to connect to the server every time. As far as I know my connection is stable because all my other online applications function fine. Is there any way solve this problem? I'll wait for a reply but until then I'll try to see if the problem is on my end.
"Saber is all that matters(well, mostly)"
"Honestly, it's a great game and does a great job balancing the mechanics and the servants."
"The only game I'm still playing, with an old age."
3 Stars because that's what you always give me
Increase rates please
"Terrible drop rate, and about half an hour of grinding to get enough QP to level a single skill a single step. No autoplay or skip, does not respect you or your time. Noble Phantasms aren't special Nasu, this game has destroyed their mystique."
Forma said game is good so I say it good
The game was going alright until it doesn't want to lode in anymore but other then that the game is epic
Pretty good
The game and graphics are great but it would be better if it had a save function like linking to Google play
Fun but the gacha destroyed me...
"Servant drop rate is a lie I only got essence, how can i use a essence if I don't have a good servent"
Take my money
Good game but don't like the summoning. It is really hard to get a good 5 star or even a 4 star and it's even worse if you want to get one that you like or looks cool.
Gives me so much salt
I love the story that's all
There were black people in this game
Played the JP version for 3 years strait and have loved it till my government banned the JP version AND now I need to RESTART but i enjoy the game and love it to bits so replaying is worth it in my eyes
"STAYs true to the entire FATE multiverse in a fun, colorful, creative, & cohesive way! If you are a fan of any of the FATE anime series, then you gotta give this Gacha Game a honest to tet shot imo"
Game r√°c nh∆∞ng y√™u Nero n√™n cho 5*
The game does have a great story but not free to play friendly. It's an expensive money pit with horrible pull rates for servants and essence. Outside of the story the game offers a grind you down experience to remotely enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone if they were genuinely interested.
Its life changing
Too many same charatcer
Nvm its poggers
Yaya
"While not a game for everyone, Fate/Grand Order is an amazing gem of a mobile phone game. I can't recommend to people without a lot of free time, nor is it great for people with poor impulse control. But if you can enjoy it, you'll end up with an amazing experience. The game has unique gameplay, great characters, and a story great enough to make me emotion more than once. It's not a game for everyone, but if it's a game for you then it offers one of the best mobile phone experiences possible."
Worst game ever!don't download this
my friend forced me to download this :(
The game is excellent but the gacha's rate is suck.
Love this series. Seems complicated and overwhelming at first. Not so bad and totally worth it.
No Sq
Great‚≠ê
There are times that I can't log in to the game for a whole day even though I hace stable internet connection and lost my log in streak. Too bad
Loved the story and started playing because I'm a big fan of the franchise. However the summon system sucks. The drop rates are not accurate and the temporary drop rate ups don't work. I performed 200 paid summons and did not get a single 5 star servant at a rate of 1% which should theoretically guarantee 1 5 star drop every 100 summons. The story was fun but not enough. I wanted to play with the characters that i got to see in the anime but not with these fake drop rates.
It's all fun and games until you save everything for a certain servant and you don't get it
I DON'T HAVE TIME Game won't lemme catch my breath I can't progress the story cause I get distracted by events
Its fate nuff said
I like everything about this game except the terrible rates but still one of the best games out there
"Got Jeanne 1tic, f2P btw üòÄ"
"excellent way to learn history, albeit a bit skewed but understandable if you think about it from a logical perspective. overall a good game and great way to just spend idle time."
"The story is the biggest draw. While Fate fans will feel right at home, newbies won't really be alienated, at least in my opinion. The gacha isn't as bad as others make it out to be, I can clear the final boss with 3 stars and free event servants. Having 5 stars is nice but it isn't necessary to win."
"Moderate challenge, great characters, fun combat, these are a few things that make this game enjoyable to play, the pull rates are dreadful but it's fair to ftp players and still offering new content frequently makes it a great game to play."
Keep up the good work..
Kill me
"Fine, I gotta admit, this is one good game for me. I mean, sure, it has flaws, but you can't say no to a game like this. Although I do have some regrets, like playing this game, considering it wants you to waste your money for quarts, but I guess it is fine if you play it patiently..."
fun and anime waifues
Now we just need to wait for jp events
"Everything is great, except the Gacha Rate."
Anime woman nice pair of Badonkers
"As a fan of the anime, i really enjoyed this game and the game is very f2p friendly. But is there any way to save this game's data like connect it fo facebook and google accounts?"
"I freaking love this game. The story, the game play...and especially the awesome servants you can pull from the gacha."
We love this game.
Would of been 4 star but the game is a whaler unless you spend real money you won't get many 5 star
"Beware!!! This game is unforgiving for f2p players,if you want to play this game.You need to grind everyday."
"Nice characters with nice voice actor/ess, good game play, love this game so much."
Pretty fun to play for free play it's pretty good with getting characters and events will give you tons of loot too great game
"Great game. Despite the fact this game leaving you cent empty in your pockets and making you feel dead inside, the game is fun regardless. Mechanics is easy, event is fun and ""free"" to try. üôÉ"
"Game is grindy, repetitive, and has low rates but the actual gameplay and story is fine."
"I want this game to have gmail/facebook account bind so you can easily switch account amd to have more secure account, If you dont make your account transfer data ID you could lose your account"
It's a gacha game
Fun things are fun
I enjoy the story and characters just wish the rate ups were higher by a little bit and new gameplay modes so it can be fun when there is no new story or events going on.
It's so much fun to play this'-')/
The living embodiment of 'digital Stolkholm syndrome.' It's a meme that this game has the worst summon rates out of any gacha .The developers are extremely stingy with the premium currency. I understand that people absolutely adore this game for the story but the convolutedness and length of each story section is tedious. The game is on a one way track to being overshadowed by newer gachas that can offer what people want. For me game play is king instead of the mundane loop of each similar fight
hate gacha games but im a sucker for good character designs so here we are LOL
"C'mon devs, its already almost four year already. PLEASE INCREASE SERVANTS SUMMONING RATE UP AND PLEASE DO ADD PITY OR GUARANTEES SYSTEM TO THIS GAME. Everyday while play this game. Deep in my heart, i wish nothing but one day, this game going to have it own servants guaranteed system like all gatcha based on game outside there to improved everyone chances to ever get even a slices of happiness to obtaining any desired servants in game. Good day sir"
I Really Like the game But The Drop Rate Event's not to much
Pain.
I want co-op mode
Yes My life depends on this
just got better...
It's a great game
Just remember lower star characters are viable! You might not get the ideal pulls but every unit has a use!
I've played this game ever since It was released and its the best game ever but after a while it gets boring
"I like the game but you don't always get the Servant you are hoping for!! I've been trying to get a few of the characters as they are in the anime but other than that it is a very good game... I gave it 3 stars for certain reasons? You will see what I mean! Be Good too friends & Be Safe! Also Be Kind too each other ,if you can!"
its painful
Lots of fun!
"I really appreciate it, it gives me knowledge about the history about every myth,epic and legend of every nation's heroes and kings"
worst event
Very Cool story and characters
It's like cocaine but way more expensive
Love it !
"addictive and fun. only issue is the cost of the payable content, but they give you a lot for free too."
Great missions. Cute characters. Smart system of gatcha fights
Best gacha game.
Pretty fun but I have never been to big of a fan of banners oh well. Still a decent game.
Great Game need better summoning system
5/5 this game ruined my life
I love everthing abour this game from story to gameplay My only issue is the poor optimization. There's no reason for a 2d game to be so demanding
Love fate!
"Depressing and repetitive, hard to get 5s,even if you did its horrible to level. No way to save or sync data, account is locked on 1 phone until you do a full transfer."
Gacha hell won't release me
It's fun For people that know the anime and stuff It's also got a lot strategy thinking in it
I should give it a 5 star but when I play the game I'm lagging even tho my internet is fine my phone is brand new but it's laggy I keep clearing cache but still laggy
"This is a great app, I have trouble playing it down sometimes because how wonderful it is, the characters, the animation, the story line, the voice, actors and everything else is wonderful, I am in love with this game! üéÆüíï"
"Possible to play f2p, although daunting to start. Fun story and generally fulfilling to fans of the franchise prior to arriving at this game. Great game, though summon rates can definitely be felt for their abyssmal percentages."
I love this game :3
Y'all just arent lucky getting 2 sitonai in 2 multis so you gonn have to hold the L
Great gacha game. Fans of the Fate series will enjoy it. Avoid if you struggle with gambling addictions or impulsive purchases.
Nice character's and a good storyline could use some work with the gatcha system in terms of servants being rewarded
Nice game . . But rate up is a lie . . Want lancer ssr . Huhuhuhuhu
"good gods, I love this game! I'm free to play and have trouble getting the 5 star characters, but it's still enjoyable. wish they could use the English voice cast in the game, but I'm starting to get used to it. The updates take up way too much space so I wish they would clear out the irrelevant parts whenever there is an update."
Great Game!! Always been a fan of the francise and I love the way they made the original story like all the anime series.
"Even though summoning can make you tear your hair off, the stories amazing, I love almost every character."
"I give it 5 stars because of how smooth the gameplay is. Also, love the contents that's been released every month, really addicting to finish it up."
How addicting is this gacha? I'm hooked!
It's fun and a great time killer.
Very fun and easy to play. Excellent plot and events. Please fix the gacha rates.
"I greatly enjoyed playing this game, although I don't like that some Servants are only available for a limited period of time."
Nasuverse. Y e s.
Wahhhh moreeeeeee
"App running on a new tablet, works great! Been a fan of the Fate franchise for years, happy to run it!"
"If I didn't love the franchise as much as I do, I wouldn't play Grand Order. It is the most unforgiving gacha game I've ever heard of ‚Äî there's no ""pity counter"", no ""mileage"" system, the paid special roll doesn't allow you to choose the unit, past event reruns are lost forever for new players ‚Äî not having one or two of these features is ok but I know plenty of similar games that have all of them and this has none. If you're not fond of the franchise (as I am) you're probably better off elsewher"
This is really a great game though downloading takes time but really worth the wait. It put me in Fate series too! (Update: I swtiched phones. I cant do the data transfer even when I input my password and transfer ID. All my beautiful servants there are gone )
5 stars for my lovely Mashu.
Nice 10/10 took mortgage out on my house to support my np5 waifu addiction
gacha is a lie other than that the game is very fun and i love it
Greato Gatcha
"Got Merlin from a single on my birthday. Then got gramps from 9 sq. Also Skadi in a multi. In exchange for my EX luck, I give you 5 ‚òÜ."
Solid title with a great story. Gatcha is a little unfair but you will still be able to play FTP without too much hassle
Got good and it got boring lost more than one account to thw abyss of this damn game not worth the time or money
"As a Fate fan, this game has been very enjoyable so far. Storyline is good, expected more from Fate but it isn't so bad. Everything else is great, music, gameplay, events, servants...etc. Only downside really is the horrible gacha rate, but this would only effect you if you want a specific servant. The game is very f2p friendly, you get plenty of 5* and 4* servants for free, and most 3* characters are not so bad. It's totally playable even without spending money."
Waifu collector
It is fun
No more than GACHA games with good story and character (THE WORST GACHA GAME)
"I think that the game quality has gone up significantly since launch. A lot of frame rate stutter has been eliminated, app size reduced, and the user interface has been made more convenient, also the meta has been improved, no more berserker supremacy oh god. The story up to Solomon has reduced AP and getting up to level 100 is easy, so it won't take forever just to get to the newest events. The only thing that is missing is fully voiced story, hopefully they implement this in the future."
amazing game very fun decent devs
"It's hell but, it's my kind of hell"
"I've spent hours here everyday, mostly farming, story is very nice, characters are amazing"
"Very cool. Pretty accurate from the anime. Nothing much wrong about it except the low chances of 5 star servants but that's just how gacha games work. rates are low. Overall pretty cool. (Edit: drop rates. And those who say Noble phantasms are long just double the battle speed and people who say this is a low effort game, just try and make one and i'll see you do it. And i only have 2 SSRs and do i complain? No.)"
Love the show love the game
F u all i can't get a ssr for a month now
Waifus. Thats all I gotta say.
"Love the game, the story and the experience."
"I love fate and love this game. It's the only mobile game I consistently come back to. There are problems I think like lack of modes and grinding is a NIGHTMARE but I love this game, it could just be better."
Take all my money
"Stingy gacha, long grind to the top. And still the one game that has outlasted every other on my phone. Please send help."
Still awesome.
"Well developed game with a TON of content, only real flaw is shared with every other gacha in that it can take a while to get your favorite characters unless you shell out the big bucks"
i recommend if you are into the anime! Also strangely addicting.
Best game ever (not recommend)
I love gacha games
"My serotonin levels where through the roof when I pulled Merlin, Waiver (twice), skadi etc. But when I didn't get what I wanted I cried a bit. I'm a proud story skipper expect the lost belt prolog. I'm here for the material and servents 5/5."
Salt......
It's like hell but in a good way.
"Having some trouble with frame rate in okeanos (the third singularity). Anywhere is just fine but during battle in okeanos would slow down to a near halt causing problems for game play. Edit(1): It's all fixed now. üòÅ Edit(2): Now everything is good and working as it should be. The gacha rate could be better, but it's a given."
It could've been a five star but i made it four star because of the summoning system sucks
Prty fun game and cool to see so many servants.
Behind 2 years of fresh content. Not worth it.
9.5/10 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"The gameplay is great. The characters are great. The story is great, at the later part at least. But the gacha hurts so bad. Still, it's not as if you cannot play it without the higher rarity units. It's just that the characters are so lovable that you want to get them so bad."
It is great and the story is very great
SSR PLEASE !! ü§ß‚úåüèª
BEST GACHA GAME (including the salt) üíØ‚úî
"gacha system is absolutely brutal. gameplay is fine, story is fine. beware of gambling addiction etc, but you can play okay for free"
"Outstanding game. Great characters, great plot. The only issue I have is with the constant all consuming grinding for ascension materials. Other than that, a great game"
"Great game and very addicting, even though the content is a bit outdated it's still very fun to play."
It's good and all but since I broke my phone..I'm trying my number for the data transfer and for some reason I can't get it so I'm hoping that I can get it soon.
My favorite game
"Been playing for 7 months now, enjoying the game due to its well written stories, awesome character design and easy to learn gameplay mechanics. You don't have to really spend a cent in-game but supporting the developers by spending is great as well. Low rarity units are useful for game contents which is great compared to other games were the low tier characters becomes unusable. Can be played casually."
"Summon rates are garbage, it doesn't deliver on it's promise for 4-star summons on the 10x summon. ""Drop rates up"" on event specific summons is a total lie like all games with this mechanic. I wouldn't waste any money on this game. Thank goodness I didn't."
It pretty cool
"Played since day 1. Gacha sucks, yes, but I love this game and it keeps pulling me back in. Soundtrack and story are amazing, and it has a ton of characters I love. 10/10, best mobile game."
The game would be ALOT better if was easier to get characters for the ftp players. Otherwise it is a fun turn based game that can help you pass the time.
"way too addicting :D had to quit because of personal reasons but i had fun, you have to stop your addiction someday"
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Put craft essences and units in seprate banners and also add a pvp system and also add a autos system for battling ü§°
I like the game but I do have a question why hasn't this come to consoles.
I think that this is a good idea from type Moon and the team my good I mean it's good for content and also combining everybody's favorite characters from every type Moon works and everybody also can get invested into the story of the games and also the side plots and especially it's a good pastime if there aren't any new fate works out.
Turn based slow pace
Cant connect !!!!
Literally the example of a bad gacha game trying to rob you
"Anime club got me into this game. Plenty of nice characters (especially Waifus). I will say the gacha is kind of a pain, but hey, not all games are perfect. Also the story is very in-depth and fun"
"Great stories and no money needed to progress, been playing for 2 years and the constant event keeps the game exciting!"
Gameplay is stupid.
Boring game with a lot of gacha.
"So far the experience is great! I have been getting a lot of sr and ssr servants and the game mechanics is simple! I wish that there woukd be golden fruit drops in quests even just a little. But overall, it is good!"
It's a very great game but seriously we needed a pity for the rates i'm a f2p player and I can't enjoy the game in terms of the summonings.
Abussive game they took my account and wont give it back cause im a f2p. Thats twisted bro you cant just take peoples account and say you wont help whats the point of your support crewn if you dont even give effort to them.
Abussive game. accounts here is not safe if you lost your account they wont help you get it back for those who f2p and p2w. I dont recommened this game cause they dont care about you they only want your money they dont value you as a person.
"Great game but I wish the Gacha was kinder to both me and my wallet when I want to get a certain Servant or Craft Essence. To a somewhat lesser degree is the grind to level up everything to the max, like skills, levels, and a much lesser extent the servant wardrobe."
my favorite mobile game of all time
I only redownload this game when there is a paid 5* banner so i can whale. I uninstall cus of my gambling addiction plus i like the anime.
eh.
"Awful rates, on my primary account I might have gotten 2 or 3 five stars within a year of playing. Be prepared to dish out your wallet because the more they add craft essences, the harder it is to get the character you want."
Gud
ok
"Fantastic game, BUT the gatcha drops and experience gains could be improved."
well im angry right now because of the event prisma codes i mean i finish the story but the next main mission wont start. but the game is good cool and well its so hard to get good 5 star characters though. but the game is good and well farming things you needed well thats good too.
Awsome
gacha game good
"The gacha rate is ridiculous, and comes with no form of pity whatsoever. It baffles me that people can play this without questioning l"
Boring as crow.
"Probably has one of the worst gacha in all the games I have played, and yes i play a lot of gacha games. There is no guarantee system, rate ups is a lie, and rng for a few other random accounts are godlike. A cash grab game which sells premium currency at Php 4000+ just for 5-6 pulls which doesn't even guarantee you anything. Aside from gacha, the story is amazing, the gameplay is repetitive and gets really boring after a while. Point is if you want to collect servants then give up."
"Beside of the management problem in South Korea, the story is really boring. Shame on using Fate franchise. Deleted within just 3 days. Guys, play Epic Seven, the story is much more fun."
Great game if you can whale or have luck S
hello ive been trying to connect to the game server and open the game but with each time i doesn't. Pleaseee helpppppp i love this game but i cant even open it.
dimunyung gacha
"Honestly, the game itself is pretty good, but the permanently missable, limited-time content is a BIG mark against it"
It won't work fate hates my phone üòÇüòë
The story is amazing and if u like fate than u would love the story its just that the combat system is so boring and doesn't really take any skill.
"If you love the series then this is for you the storys long plenty servents to choose from and the customer service is tip tier, I lost my account for a while and when I finally emailed support I got it back in just two days. This game is definitely sum you gotta experience at least once."
Terrible gacha rates
Gacha hell 10/10 would do it again
After two years and still no google play? Account link?
Please give me 5* I beg you give me 5* servant please Edit: I got JALTER!! no more luck for me
"Trademark: Horrible gacha system with absurd rates and no pity. The game hasn't aged well: The graphics + UI are horribly dated, battle sprites and animations are static: translations are iffy occasionally: gameplay is barebones empty (with the occasional challenging stages), Story quality is inconsistent: Granted the lb and babylonia singularity + other EoR storyline are superb. But jarring ones like septem exists. Bonus points for being PvE-focused and very casual (save for lotto events)"

Is good.
"FGO has helped keep me grounded in darker times in my life thanks to all of these amazing characters and this immaculate story. I adore this game and the franchise it comes from. F2P for years to spending some here and there for banners feels amazing. Thanks again for all the great years FGO, when the final chapter of this story finishes....Tears will be shed, but I will still smile knowing I saw it through to the end and I will regret nothing once it comes. Here's to a few more years!"
This is going to be a long fight quest!

The game's amazing!

"I love the story and character options and events that happen. The only problems I have with the game is the saint quartz and the summoning. This game makes it harder than most to get the characters you want because you have to do it more than most games. Also I wish they would repeat or release more events so we dont have to have a huge waiting period in between. But besides that, this game is better and more enjoyable than most games out there."
Best PNG collector on the market.
Just amazing
"The gacha is absolute garbage, but the game itself is actually pretty fun. Can be entirely played by using your favorite waifus, but team composition is still pretty vital, especially with later story missions in the game that are almost impossible without powerful Limited 5-star servants."

"I hate this game. 5/5 stars, do something else before this game sucks the living force out of you."
Bruh moment
Just a good game for fate fans
For some reason the game isnt loading always stuck in the black screen so I think theirs a problem
Great game and storyline but man that gatcha hurts it for me
Let the gacha consume you
"Lose all your money to the gacha gods, get so deep into the pit that you gambler's fallacy your way too waiting another year for a png. Read a boring incompetent story that you then claim is ""actually really good"" and ""is a cut above other gacha games"" (like that is a high bar) online to justify your awful life decisions. Have fun. I can't leave the farm. 5/5. DW actually update all your animation some still look like a newgrounds animators first attempt at flash."
"It's fun, i'm just saying"
This one of the better turn based games i hve played and i always seem to come back to playing it
I'd give it 5 stars if it had a pity system to get 5star servants
"Nice game with decent story. The drop rates for 4/5 star servants are really low though, but eh. Still enjoyable. EDIT: I long for a world without mobage."
It's fun and challenging!!!
"No pity is terrible, also locking events behind story is awful, content is permanently 2 years behind JP. Otherwise it's okay."
"The story and characters are amazing, and there are good new events with story regularly."
I have played this game for a while and I really do think it's fun
I love png waifus
Very Entertaining game but if you hate grinding and salty gacha this game is not for u
Gacha is hell that is all
Best fate game
"FGO is a turn based RPG with by far the best story quality in mobile gaming. It can be funny, wholesome, tragic, or epic. The gameplay is also my favorite for a mobile game. It's strategic both before and during battle. There is no button mashing as FGO is turn based. In short, FGO is one of my favorite video games of all time."
Doujins are better with context.
They refuse to add better quality of life for farming.
"Old man Lishuwen with 1 ticket, i love this game, 500$ well spent"
just 1 free summon for new player? nope.. uninstalled
My gacha luck is terrible. But I am glad that low rarities are also very good to use.
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but not for everyone u have to spend a lot of time on it
I like it. But getting a 5 star seems impossible without spending money or being really luck
"This ""game"" is WAY to close to fortnite"
Good geme
Based on your luck its a gacha game dumbass stop whining. Dont play if you hate gacha games. I have no issue with the game gacha rate. I just love to see historical/Mythical heroes and villains interact each other. I hope they will add South East Asian Heroes and villains
"don't expect to be pulling 5 stars oftenly, the rates are really low but the game itself is quite fun especially if u like to grind"
"Hey thats hell you're walking into. have you ever felt despair? If not then you'll feel it here, all in all its a good game and has a great story, and ofc the waifus thats important."
"This game is pretty awesome, but i think the developer should make this game available on Indonesia. So us Indonesian can download without using VPN. Overall this game is so good! i like the motion, i loke the Skill effects its to awesome! i recommend this game especially if u watch ""The Fate Series"" ( btw pls make SSR servant easy to get xD )"
Great story ngl
"1100 day login, 700sq + 80++ tix for Kiara but never come, 100/10 would roll for again."
Still would like auto battle.
10/10. I got Jalter now. Thanks.
Great game and visuals played this for over a year and I still enjoy the content they come out with.
10/10 did get scathach
Umu
It's great but I do wish some things were easier like strengthening servants or getting a particular servant rather than the same one over and over again.
Wish more servants in friend points or rate up be a little bit better
"Play other gachas, the rates in Fate is trash and there is no pity system."
"Nice game, good story and I really really love this series"
It's actually very fun even without getting 5 stars it's really awesome you can finish the story with 3 stars and below alone
Amazing game. Story is superb once you reach camelot. Honestly some of the best fate stories after this.
I guess I'm lucky on my pulls and got 8 SSRs now... Started since launch date without rerolling. Anything that I can ask for in a mobage that I can play everyday either to kill time or grind in an event. Update: now with 29SSRs :)

Waifus wars
"This game is great. The story is fantastic and I can't get enough. The visual novel aspect is informative to the story and fairly interactive. I'm playing after watching FGO: Babylonia. The graphics are pretty solid. Noble Phantasms and animations are gorgeous, it's not a pay to win game and there are loads of quests to earn crystals and stuff to get more summons. Hands down my favorite gacha game. 10/10"
Long story arcs but good. Can be a pay to win to get the best heros. Fun to play. Lots of charcters to try and get out of loot boxes.
"After playing this game for 11 months, I can say that this is great. Stories are the best, funny and sometimes give you depression. Lower rarity servants (e.g. Anderson and Mozart) can substitute SSRs and pretty much okay to me if I didn't get the servant on rate ups. Some people just don't know how to utilize their servants. Keep up the great content 'cause I'm loving it."
Game is nice i hope they would just increase the droprate of Certain servants.
Really depends on your rolls.
"Great game. Gacha could use a pity system, or more GSSR tho."
"Game is actual garbage. Sucks the life out of you bit by bit by tying a jpeg on a stick and shoving it in front of your face where you can't ever get it. This game is bad, the devs should feel bad, I feel bad. Don't play this if you want to live your life like a proper human being. 10/10 game, really neat."
Exceptional! Awesome story. Smooth battle sequenciesü•≥ And most of all it's free!
"Passcodes to recover old accounts are the absolute worst way to go about it, I'd figured I'd give the game another shot after a few months not playing but it doesn't link progress to a play account."
Send help I'm in too deep
"i loved the game and have sinked in a fair bit of money and time to it as well as i thought to support it, but when i deleted the game and forgot to make my transfer code and had to contact them to recover my account is where things took a dive. i had all the necessary screenshots to prove that the account belonged to me except for one purchase where they asked from me that never appeared on my purchase history, so now sadly i'm never touching this game again though i really wanted to get back."
Playing it for almost a year now
"The text options during the cutscenes have no effect on the story and are often the same choice anyway meaning you can skip them if you don't care about the storyline. The battles are extremely repetitive and there doesn't seem to be any type of pvp meaning your interactions with other players are limited to who you want as your ""support"" servant. Guess the final nail in its coffin was having no way to get back into my account once I got a new phone. Literally have to start all over again."
absolute gacha hell. what is pity? 10/10 the true gacha experience
Its an addiction once you fully get into this game.
Been years honestly playin this hame on and off the rates for units is so bad lol you can barely even get a 4 star let alone a 5 star like in general the game yes is good but the rates are horrid kinda hurts you abit if you've saved to summon and get no units at all even. Maybe have seperate banners for Units and such. I just feel like this game has potential but is so stuck in its old ways its gonna be absolutely be left in the dust when compared to new fun gachas that are making things better
Watch out for this dishonest game they deliberately switched out the 7th and 14th New Year craft essences and blame it on the players even when it isn't necessary to read the patch notes. TL;DR scammer game really dishonest can't trust them even if your life depends on it.
Beautiful game. Everything about it is perfect with the exception of the horrible character drop rate AND the lack of pity.
The game is generous like seriously every time there's an event too much SQ the rates are kinda bad but it's a fun game the only pain is the grinding.
Love the Fate sires and love the game I can't wait to start lostbelt soon I've been playing for 2 years now and I can't get enough.
The game is fun but it tends to be a bit of a hastle when farming for resources so i would like to recomend an auto battle after you get a saint quartz from the encounter in the singularaties but thats just my opinion all in all it's a fun game to play
It is very fun but collecting saint quarts for new players is a lot of work. There should be a easier way to get them. Its a somewhat simple game to understand so it is enjoyable.
When's the next engine update like in jp?
I love this game even though I have bad rng on pulls...
"Splendid, breathtaking story. However the gacha rate is horrible."
Always stuck on Connecting screen. I cannot give a 5 star rating on a game I cannot play.
I can't even play
"I've played quite a bit and overall I love the fate franchise and that's what got me to try the game in the first place but at least for me gets far too grindy and repetitive, events and singularities often require you to farm for very long for any barely worthy rewards, that would be alright but takes terribly long and it's forced. The stories are the strongest point but lately they seem low effort also I get they need to make money but the gachapon drop rates are mad low. Could've been great."
"Don't need explanation, just jump right away ;)"
"I love this game. I've only been playing for like 160+ days and I'm enjoying this so much especially the characters and story. I also like farming which is perfect for me cause I like games like this. The gacha can be bad sometimes but it's still gacha there's a chance anyways (NP2 Hokusai, why didn't you come home to me)"
Stratigic and nive story c c c c c c c
Gacha is the worst
"I got my waifu, thanks Type-Moon"
"Terrible odds. Seriously, if you want to play a gacha go play any other gacha. This is the worst odds with particularly expensive currency."
Rate up
Rate up is a LIE
"This game has the worst rates for summoning I have ever seen in any game, EVER!!! If you love Fate and just wanna read the story until you're not strong enough (due to an awful gacha system) then play this. But don't put money into it. A total waste of your money, leaving you with useless characters nobody cares about. Gives you 20 summoning tickets and a bunch of gems, and when used, gives you nothing but a bunch of useless characters. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! 1* until proven otherwise..."
Been around since launch and will continue to stay!
Rates are trash. The mechanics on this game are too simple and progression is a joke. Was hoping this was a better than Epic Seven or Summoners War but this game is simply not up to par.
the summons are rigged all you ever will get are craft essences wouldn't recommend
It's a cash grab that's all this game is!
"This game needs to be brought into present times. The game lacks full screen for new phones. It does not connect with Google or any other service to save progress. It would be amazing to switch devices without having to use a transfer code. Other than that its a fun, yet grindy game."
Waifus collection
"Boring RPG mechanics to play if you're not a fan of the franchise. The battle system is slow because you have to watch every animation after activating skills as well as NPs. NPs can be shortened but can still take up to 8 secs just to pass. The effort to strengthen your characters can take weeks because of how limited exp fodder is. Events are a grind if you dont summon event CEs. So you're encouraged to summon every event, but the drop rates for characters are low so you either save or grind"
"I spent $200 just to get Ushiwakamaru Assassin. From this point on, will be playing free with my ultimate waifu!!"
"Speaking as a 3 year veteran of this hell I signed up for, I do not regret it one bit. The story is engaging, gameplay is decent and team building w/o the big supports can be complex but fun to tackle. Entirely possible to play through as an F2P with only silvers, bronze and welfares alone. Only major issues are the timesink needed for events and daily farming, plus the item rates being gross at times. I would complain about the gacha rates, but a lot of others have beaten the dead horse."
"Edit: My review was removed about a week ago. Automatic 0/5 but can't do that here. Actual review: No free event summon, 1% for 5 star servant, 99% for 4 star craft essence (NOT CHARACTORS) from multi summon, CRAFT ESSANCE and CHARACTOR summons are MIXED in Summon Pool (Who does that?!), outdated UI, Story trash, servants are ok but its the gameplay thats trash. Played for over 4 years +$240 deep in it. This game needs an update seriously..."
Lose your soul to this game
I have walked into this hell for Mama Raikou but still haven't got her. Sad Gudako noises*
Great game 10/10
"f2p friendly? LUL. Even your hard earn 1k sq wont guarantee you an ssr. then you'll see someone flexing with single multi with 2-3 ssr? RIGGED ASFK. WORST SHT. TRYHARD AND BEING NOT A JP VERSION THE GAME WONT BOTHER TO YOU. IMAGINE YOUR HARD EARN 1K SQ AND ONLY EVEN GET NON RATE UP ""SR"". HOPE 2021 BRING THIS GAME END."
A fun game with good servants available. The five stars are a pain to find but worth it. And a decent story. What more could I ask for?
1 multi 3 scathacth.
Just giving the game back what it like to give me
Obviously 5 stars
Good story. Ok graphics. Bad Gacha.
really bad game. Hateful no autobattle.the summom.suck really bad.friend of mine gets a email form they offering no help.they lie about who controls the game.they need to fix alot of things with this game. What the point of writing reviews when all they care about is 5 stars. Why don't you put in a trade system in so people can trade servants that they dont want for ones they want. Put that in i get u five stars The trade system would work for u guys.trade sercet
This is a fun game and the animation is great
"The gacha is hell but that's what I love about this game, best game for me alright."
"5‚≠ê rating.. Graphics, Animation, Controls, Everything is Perfect, Especially the Story.. Overall Im Glad that i Found this Game, or should I say ""It is Fate"" for Developers keep Improving the Game thanks!"
No way of recovering data and lack of real help from customer service.
"Grindy, and demands a fair amount of time during in game events, but really fun and can be easily enjoyed as a free player."
Is this a fantastic game and I still will support it but I gave a 4 just because when you have three stones it's annoying that you get craft essence and if the doves are looking at these reviews and they look at my reviews of this game I hope in the future they basically separate the servants and craft essence because I really want a banner that's have just servants and not craft essence I mean we can have them it's just that can they make a separate out of them
Terrible safety net high chance of not being able to access your account the second time around if you tried to transfer it without setting up.
Would be nice if you could enable account binding to Google or email
Got an email form there team wouldn't fixed the summons . Come on someone tell u u got a problem fixed it. Like I said Billy the kid ten times in two weeks.if they don't fixed this soon im going to Facebook with the screen shot to show people what there doing. It they fixed the summons I give them 5 stars.the same thing today know all I was get was germio what is this shouldn't be getting this guy 5 times in one day
"Got 3 artoria's, amazing"
This game is good but every time it updates it keeps deleting my account üòí.
"Always a fun time killer, I would even be willing (I have spent money) to spend a little bit of money on it."
This game demands that you read the fine print even when the notices aren't mandatory nor have an agreement linked to it. They fail to admit that they are in the wrong and only compensate us when the datamine proves so.
The game menu layout needs to be more simpler also there needs to be more f2p spawns and better gacha rates otherwise it's a decent game. :/
Can the devs please make a feature where we can lock our SQ's until a certain banner?
fun to play
"Best gacha game, I hope they add more features and updates."
I can't play it says can't connect
the graphics and animation looks good but I olny give three stars because it is hard to get saint quartz not to mention the gacha kinda sucks so please just please adjust the gacha rate
This game doesn't require money no matter how much u play it
I learnt History from this game üóø
This game is really good just got to not be tempted to summon all the time but can you guys add a feature where we can increase the fps of the game and we need more illyas
"Hello, I meet the same problem as the one below, it keeps saying that I need to clear my data and when I did, it said it was interrupted by my internet connection. I tried other games and there was no problem with my internet connection, I really like the game so I hope the publisher fix the bug. Please take this issue into your consideration or else, you would lose abundant potential players."
I actually enjoy this game alot
"Been playing this game since summer 2017 and it has kept me playing the entire time. The servants and the story are all super interesting, I just wish time would go faster I want MurumasaüòÅ"
"Give me Okita and I'll give this 5 star, and the lost acc service is kinda lazy"
It's a very good games a lot of character Fun story
"If I was to call this game something, it'll be: The Best Mobile Game Ever. Why do I think that, well the graphics are amazing, story feels amazing and the characters are awesome. But don't be deterred by the Gacha part of the game, the game awards you for completing quests, but time is key, and we all play games to burn time, 10/10 game I say."
The best waifu game.. All story (main or event) are always fun although the game is really grindy but you can still choose not to and just focus on other materials you need.. Game is kind enough too to give ample summoning materials.
"Great characters and the gameplay is good (I guess); absolutely terrible gacha system. Whose the genius that decided you needed 30 saint quartz (which are materials that are quite a pain to collect since you only get ONE after each quest) just to summon 10 servants/craft essences that, most likely won't even be that good. And WHY is there a guaranteed summoning system that requires PAID saint quartz to use? There are SO MANY inconsistencies with the story too. This game is ultimate-level cheap."
I lost my account even tho i had a transfer code after i tried to log in ingame it worked but after it worked i deleted the game because i had to i was planning on downloading it again after a few days but after i downloaded it and used the transfer code it didn't work so i lost my account after i created a new account only then i noticed that the code can only be used once :(( I lost my 5 star abbygail & 5 star enkidu Is there a way for me to recover my account? PLEASEHELP :(( PLEASEEE
Hi developer i am an avid fan of fate and this game... i accidentally transfered all my data of fgo to a corrupted sd card i tried downloading the app agin but there is no option on recovering account.. how can i recover my account?? Pls help me..
Uhh
The story is fun and exciting and the servants are also amazing....Great Game!
"Everything is rng, bleep bleep."
"Please fix the ""app not launched properly issue"". I always uninstall my game to log in back and its wasting my mobile data. So please fix it....."
Free SSR When DW :(
I enjoy the story and characters very well.
After playing and experiencing how garbage Dissidia Opera Omnia is (or has become) FGO is leagues better than it. Draw rates still kinda suck but at least its honest. Amazing story but can get frustrating with terrible boss fights that makes sense story wise but don't translate well to ganeplay. Also please think about new players because your events are aimed at ppl who been here for awhile and that sucks.
The App only shows me a loading screen and it keeps failing to connect to the server
"Story: 5/5 Animation: 5/5 Gacha rate: 3/5 F2P: 4/5 Story is so rich seriously, you wont get bored. There so much time i got emotional. Animation is good too especially the Noble phantasm of servants. Gacha rate is a love and hate thing here in FGO. As a f2p player if you dont spend willy nilly to some random banners you get by just using free SQ(In game currency) I myself has a lot of 5 stars servant without spending. And there are some free servant they give from events. 2019 player"
Grindfest. Boring story. Played it because of FZ and trying to understand where the 1 bil revenue went to instead of the budget.
Awful summon rates in any gacha game
"Very fun game with great story and mechanics. But I could barely get through the campaign mission because I can never get good summon results, so I can't ever do limited time events including the 2020 Christmas event. I did over √ó50 summons on rate up to get nothing but 3 stars that aren't even the correct attribute I need. Item drop ratings are also terrible and I can't ascend my Servants. Really bad drop ratings... Rate up is a big lie... never got banned character, EVER."
"Good game, i don't know why they complain just try out this game and try not to get addicted. Very gameplay wise, sometimes luck is just not on your side. After a lot of time playing this, you would realize its very grindy but releases new content. You wont run out of things to think about"
I accidentally deleted the game and I lost everything what can I do
I love blowing over $200 dollars and getting a single ssr
Gacha sucks they never fixed it if I'd rate it it will be 0/5 stars
Super fun game but I wish there was a trade feature to trade heroes with friends
no SSR give me goddamnit
"Fate/Grand Order is the only gacha game I can't bring myself to quit. Even after weeks or months away, I find myself crawling back. The gameplay has solid strategy/nuance with a lot to grind, and the story (despite its lackluster start) manages to keep me captivated over the years. The true appeal of this game is the servants you roll for. With so many personalities there's bound to be one to your liking. Also the doujinshi and fan art gets so much better with context"
I love playing this game since I'm a fan for this series. However the gacha were too cruel for me cause I used a lot of saint quatz but still can't get them. Eventually makes me fall to despair and wanna quit.
"There are many things that they don't explain to you like where to get certain materials for ascension, and although ive only been playing for a week, the game gets old really fast BUT they do give you a lot of freebies so that makes up for it, free players are definitely welcome but im quitting for now."
"This game has a great story with well written events that offer premium items for those willing to put in the effort. Definitely not a pay to win system where even 'common' heroes can compete. The story, the lovable characters events are a major hilights and they keep me comming back! It can however get a bit grindy and the rolls can be painful if you don't wait for certian summon events or events which offer free servants."
Pretty aight
"It's good and unhealthy... for your walletüòÇ nah jk, it's optional to be p2p. But the great thing about this game is the community it brings forth including the memes, fanarts and MANY other things(if you know what I mean)"
"This game us an outdated gacha games yet still relevant to this day. Even though the gameplay is outdated, the superb story itself able to keep this game alive (of course waifus and husbandos as well). BUT the rate of 5* servant is one of the most abysmal ever. I believe people who still playing this game are a Masochist... including me."
"Love it Best Waifu's, Best story, Best ost. I won't mind the gatcha. i rate it 11/10."
"This game is SUPER buggy. The character Gotcha is kinda garbage. But, all around great game. Combats fun and the characters are all unique."
This is the worst game I have ever played 10/10 would roll for saber again
Lost my account
"Came for the hentai, stay for the waifu"
the game is great
Slick game with great story and hot character design.
eh ok
Trash rates still fun i love being in hell
"The ones who give bad reviews about the rate up, the item drop rates are dumb... That's why it's a gacha game, what do you expect? And the ones who lack information backing up their accounts should have other ways backing up their accounts and kmow specific procedures on taking it back properly."
"All though simple the mechanics in this Game are quite fun to play with, but the main selling point of this game is being able to play with your favorite servants which is locked behind the Gacha system. There are a lot of useful F2P servants however,but that's not why I play these Games. I understand the abysmal rates but at least throw in a pity counter. This is the first one I have played that doesn't introduce one. Overall, pretty fun and Lax but no pity counters is a no-no for me."
super duper fun
GACHA??? SAINT QUARTZ GACHA????? 10 PUUUUULL 10 PUUUUUUUUUULL!!!!! 5 STAR 5 STAAAARR... Oh.... I got Siegfried.... Yaaayy....
Love the story. Agartha and Shimousa were torture but seeing as how they're entirely optional and they had to contest with Shinjuku which gave us the beautiful duo of Jalter and Salter. They are forgiven. Rate Up is a Lie. But after a year of playing I can honestly say I've never felt the need to spend money to get a good team of Servants.
Stupid only 1 transfer
"If you like the Fate series, you will probably like this game. The combat can often feel very unfair with bosses and harder enemies, feeling like you werent meant to have a chance. The story is fine, nothing incredible but enough to give the game some depth. The gacha system is kind of frustrating, the game is really tough if you dont have a team of 4 stars or some HEAVILY leveled 3 star servants. Getting the currency to roll the gacha takes a long time without paying real money"
I lost my account and i have contacted them to try and get it back they havent sent anything and its pissing me off
I'm fan's fate sires Game are really enjoying and interesting
This game has the worst rates ever
"i sent inquiry email to make me a new transfer code, 4 days the cs not even replies my email. 4 DAYS?! surely, u should change ur cs."
Pls make animation update on altera and nursery rhyme
"The game does very well for itself, and has given me more than what I bargained for. The story is where it will really pierce your heart though, cried more than a few times."
"I enjoy this game I really do but some quality of life things need to happen or my review will stay at 2 stars. This game has been out for how long ""I know that answer"" and still the loading times are ridiculous everytime you click on something it takes way longer than it should to load but load times should be only take 5secs at max but these could take 20secs-1min ""yes I've timed it"" that makes me not want to play the game sometimes. Quality control is needed there c'mon it's been yrs now."
Only problem so far is the drop rates.
The game has a lot of content and a rich story. There is a very big list of memorable characters. There are challenging fights that are fun to tackle. Although money is not needed to play the game (and clear high level content); the rate for SR and SSR characters is very rough (although its kinda easy to get used to it... and it can be argued that the drop rate makes getting that one SR or SSR character even more exciting). Also its kinda fun if you want to get exposed to historical figures.
"A pretty unique experience, worth every hour I've played it"
"Pros: 1) Free or easy (1-3 stars) to obtain units are sufficient to get you through everything if you have a good, working team. 2) If you like Fate series, this would give you more in depth story to the Fate universe (not to mention you can control your favorite servants!). 3) There are events with certain storylines, which you could use to easily farm certain materials that you need for leveling your servants. Not to mention these events usually gives away a good 4 stars servants that you can't get anywhere/time else. 4) The English version FGO is slower than the JP FGO by 2 years. Even though we don't get the latest content, this is actually a good way for you to look at the JP events/banners and plan up ahead on which servants you want to save up for, and what events you would want to participate in. We are literally following the same (there are some tiny exceptions to this) timeline as the JP server. 5) Have a sense of what rare or super rare is. Probably not a big problem for many gamers, but I do know some other gacha games would make their rare units doesn't seem/feel rare (or rather common) at all. Here, rare is just rare, and super rare really live up to its name. Cons: 1) The game is really oriented on the story mode and events. Other than those, you are virtually left with nothing to do other than grinding some materials from places you have cleared (even so the item drop rates can be low. advised to use vents to actually get these materials). No PVP/Guild/Achievement system like other RPGs. 2) Essentially a visual novel with fighting parts being the only thing you can mostly control. At most, the choices you made during stories would only determine if you would fight certain mounters/difficulty, even so is not a common thing, and what you choose in dialogue doesn't affect your story line. Also most dialogues are not voiced in the story. 3) The rarity is real, which means you can't get your favorite servant right of the bat even if you want to pay $10000 (5 stars hero drop rate are super low and some are time limited). The best way to get your favorite hero without wasting too much money (or if you are FTP person) is to look for the future banners, plan up and save summoning crystals for that banner. Note that your favorite hero's rate up event may not appear up to a year or even more. 4) Certain events require you to finish a high level story chapter. So if you want to participate with low level servants, you got to pass through the chapters with the use of some quartz and/or command spells. 5) One sad fact is you can't go back to certain story modes and re experience the boss fight that you completed. Especially if you are rushing through stories to participate in events. Overall it is a good game, not where you must spend your money to play. But certainly if you want to collect your favorite servant, it probably won't happen very soon. The one worry I have is how this game can survive for the next upcoming years with other gacha games becoming more fun & unique (more stuffs to do) than FGO."
Very free to play friendly. Planning to buy saint quartz for the new year gssr banner ;>
It was fun at first but what really wasn't fun after trying to summon a hero 40 times and only getting one 5 star hero and nothing else other then 3 star heroes and it's fine until you get later into the story where your heroes have a level cap and you have to gather materials but they make that difficult and it takes too much grinding to do it and if you dont you will get stuck I barely got past the third singularity so all in all they just make it too difficult and it forces you to spend money
I'd give it a 5 star if it were English voice actors.
Pretty good if you like farming anime gacha games with occasional spikes of extreme difficulty. Try it for the first hour. If you like it then prepare to play it everyday. 5/5 will gacha again
Awesome story.
All I can say is that this game is for fate fans and has good thought out combat
Good for the Ip and likeable characters. But the gameplay is outdated. Play only if you're obsessed with fate.
"This is a very fun game, more so when you factor all of the fun characters from fate! I like that this game has a level of strategy to it, unlike other simular mobile games that just play themselves. If you're reading this to see if the game is worth installing, it 100% is!"
"This sucks because the events are story locked, you need to finish lostbelt part 2 just to play the events come on that's not right"
I love the game and the characters and I like the sabers
Really great game For FATE fans out there.The story by far is the best from the RPG genre
The multiple Historical singularities were Amazing.

It is very good. The rate ups are legit not like in other gacha games where rate-ups are scams like crazy. The best part is GREAT story. Totally loved it. Automatic 5 star.
Breathtaking!!!!
Love it but so much grinding.
It's fun even though there is a lot of salt in this game
"Terrible rates and outdated gameplay, but amazing characters if you're into Fate. Story is surprisingly good, especially the newer chapters."
"It is a great game with good story, but the game has some performance issues that just happens time to time. The game just freezes at times and stays frozen for several seconds, and if music is playing you can hear it even if you go to the home screen. It happens without warning and most of the time closing the app fixes it. Other than that i really enjoy the game and i most likely with keep playing it for a while longer."
Its great and nice HD graphics
im eager to find out how the story will go since i cant find an english dubbed series
"can you make this game available Acer Chromebook 15 (CB5-571, C910)?"
Finally i can play english servers.üòÜü§£ü§ó
"Terrible gacha rates but overall decent game. Saved up over 200 gems and 70 summon tickets, all gone trying to get one character to no avail."
game is good but gacha is hell
I like to know where I can get baby David
"This game is definitely in no way, shape, or form a pay-to-win game. You get very low rarity and welfare servants with skill sets so broken you can give them grails and they'll finish stories and high-difficulty challenges with no problem at all. Couple that with continual updates to strengthen those servants with Rank Up Quests and Interludes that won't make them obsolete over time. The only real reason SSR servants exist is for fanservice, and tbh that's why I gave 4 stars. I'm still salty."
This game is highly recommended for learning World History.
Horrible updates often have to uninstall an reinstall game.
"Amazing game. that's all, just play it! .....seriously though great story with likable characters and fascinating concepts. Gacha elements in this are utilized very well and every single character regardless of rarity is useful and can carry to the end of the game. I've installed many phone games but this is the only one where I actively invite other people to play."
Excellent and fair Gacha Game where you don't feel like you just miss out on things if you don't roll immediately because of reruns.
Ivan didn't drop 10/1570
This Game Is Great because of its challenging Battles Etc.. Also The Story Is Very Great!
Simply Amazing
"After one year playing this game I can assure this is a fair gacha, you don't have to destroy your wallet to get the ""good stuff"" just need patience and time, I see people on youtube spending money and not getting what you can get for free, it is totally fair to support the developer just don't fall into the addition. ""At the end THE LUCK is the real ruler here""."
Need to be able to fight back.
Great story and good heroic spirit
I can say gameplay and story are great but needs to raise the five star servants percentage instead of a decimal.
"Very fun game, I have been playing for a long time, good story & challenging boss fights"
"Overall it's a great game, it's not on the same scale as a console game, but the story more than makes up for what it lacks. Just be careful, it says free to play, but there is a gacha heavy presence in the game as well."
"A lot of fun, but getting a 5star is as likely as Mars exploding. Other than that, leveling heroes up is eh, leveling their skills up is even worse, but don't even get me started on the noble phantasm leveling, you'll almost never be able to level the 4star or 5stars up because you have to have multiple of the same hero so oof. And that's about it."
Good gameplay and massive story
It's so nice
Just a nice game in general
Love the game in general
Ebic app vry fun
"Treat the gacha system like gambling. If you have an addictive, collection-prone personality, then perhaps this game and its very real gambling elements is not for you. I say that out of earnesty as a f2p player who has about a year into this game. Of course you might be disappointed over the course of multiple 10 rolls if all you see is that 1% margin, while another person can ""hit the jackpot"" for the unit you want with a lucky ticket pull. Know your odds and strategize with what you have."
I find it sad how I've been waiting for a Christmas event then I cant do it because I need to be in Anastasia and im in Babylon
Great game specially towards fate fans.
"One of the best mobile games out there and a full blown juggernaut within its own right as a cultural phenomenon I feel or at least if it isn't it darn well should be. The series started as a VN but has gifted us with a solid mobile game, anime and manga series and done a lot more for its name than most if not all other mobile anime type games available for download. Install it, roll if you wanna or don't but do keep in mind New Years is coming up and you can get a guaranteed 5 Star, just a tip."
"Fun game but don't get addicted to gacha, there will only be pain and suffering there. That's hell you're walking into."
To loo need it rpg
"I sleep, eat, and breathe FGO"
"I lost my account because my phone screen broken when i droped during work and lost the information i needed to transfer my account on a different phone and when i went to customers support can't give then my acc id date of when i started play the game and last time i was on because i was busy working cause of covid-19.The couldn't help with me the information I did give them the purchase history,the name,birth date,devices i play on,master gender,master level,so all the money is gone Thank fgo"
Very awesome game
FIX YO RATES BRUH
RATE UP IS A LIEEEEE
Play this you hate yourself or your money.
I really like this game and the characters in mainly the bois tho lol
"Had an account and everything, until i reported one issue within the game. Contacted support and they said that reinstalling should be done. After doing so and using my transfer code i thought that all of my worries would be gone. Sure it did happen except one thing, the transfer code gave me a different account. After telling this to support they said that the said account can't be retrieved even having direct evidence that i reported through the account. What a treatment to new players. Shame"
4 star because no goggle account
People die when they are killed
Good waifu
Just make a bind system instead of a code
"First of all, this IS a gacha games...So suit yourself first Many who played this game usually like the story of fate series cause honestly, the gameplay is not that great ( almost all grind ). Though the story is great and phenomenal imo, each character has a great lore and design. Next, the gacha hell , low probability of getting 5 star servants..But it is possible to clear the game WITHOUT SSR, though u will eventually get a SSR in the near future , so don't be discourage."
Game feels really dated. Takes forever to do a 10x summon going through the animation. Not fast paced enough for me.
Good but the gacha rates are TERRIBLE
It's a nice turn based fighter. Yeah the gacha can screw you a lot but you get a lot of free sq from daily logins.
Very attractive
Wonderful game
Great game hope the rest of the story is added soon. Bugs with current event needs to be fix (battle not loading after cutscene)
Siiiiick!
"I used to play it all the time, took a break and now i cant get past the first black screen before loading the game. All ny other apps work sooooooooo..."
"Played this game probably 18 months ago, it was a ok game back then, the game play and animations were ok. But after 18 months with nothing changed it is terribly outdated and the animations are awful. Draws are still terrible with no pity element. It's really sad because the story and elements are great but the game technology itself is decades behind."
Still my main to go of gacha games especially considering I'm playing several other gacha games as well. The story is decent enough to me. The characters actually have many creative direction approach. The gameplay definitely 2 years behind JP but it's nice Dev sometimes accelerate the implementation of feature. The account binding system still terrible though (Also the gacha rate. But who's care?).
Love the game overall
"Incredible story. I'm looking forward on how it will end. Very f2p friendly that you just need 1-3 stars(and welfares) to complete the main story quests, farmings and some CQs. Gacha is still terrible but is a good experience to me. Lack of pity system is good for me because from my other bad experience for the other gacha games with pity system(Arknights). The only thing that I think needs to be fixed is the material drops."
How do i get progress back if i didn't use data transfer? Is it even possible?
"Cant even tell you my experience. I got all through the beggining and logged out, next login and it needed an update, after update i can no longer play. Keeps telling me it wasnt lauched right. Ive tried everything, which is highly unfortunate seeing as i really wanted to play this..."
I missed rent this month and my car is getting repossessed but I roll for jalter until she is home. Overall great game.
"Since magia record shut down, this has been by new favorite. Many thing are alike between these two games, and I would recommend FGO if you ever watched the anime"
"Even if I don't have an SSR, I still enjoy it with my SRs. The events are good, but can lottery events take 1 month"
The tutorial makes me want to gouge my eyes out dear god can i just open the settings QUIT LOCKING ME TO SINGULAR ACTIONS TO PROGRESS I WANT TO LOOK AT OTHER THINGS
I love fate go Dx but game more ssr pliss
1% drop rate for 5 star servant. haha hell no. screw this game.
It is suck.
"Trying to get my account back, emailed support MONTHS ago and they never replied. I put some money into this game because I love fate and I don't mind funding something I like but the lack of f/U on getting my account back is frustrating. I will change my rating if someone replies because this is a very fun game."
I like the game just a bit disapointed that i forgot to get a new tranfer number before getting a new phone
Love the Fate series
"Rates are horrible. You're going to get stuck with the worst units. There's no pity system and it takes a while to get a single multipull. When you do get a multipull its not even guaranteed you'll get a unit. You can get craft essences from pulls which don't really do much for you as a beginner. Too many hard earned pulls where all i get are craft essences. Fate is known for its heroes/servants but all you'll get are craft essences from pulls. Disappointing. No auto, outdated gameplay & graphic"
"One of the most famous and infamous gacha. The fact that you can't pity anything is a big downside, but everything else is very nice"
"Horrid gacha, cute girls."
"Longtime player (2 years +) and fan of the series. I love the game - the story, art, and characters are all top notch - but the gacha is terrible. Having paid plenty into the game, BEWARE - have spent 500sq before with no SR or SSR. With a system that allows multiple copies of a servant to be fused to power them up, there is no excuse to not have a pity rate, other than outdated thinking. Whales would still whale for np5 SSRs, while lower tier collectors and f2p would be more inclined to buy in."
This game looks amazing but due to the fact I'm unable to play it I give it 1 star. Everytime I open the app the screen goes black but the music continues to play. I've uninstalled the app and currently attempting to reinstall and try again if it works I'll gladly change my rating. I'm back 3 years later and I will say the game has changed and upgraded alot the game doesn't crash on me anymore. The gameplay is smooth the many stories are very entertaining AND it's not pay to win.
Khale
Mhm.
Great game! I'm really addicted to it
If you like fate series you will enjoy this.
"Okay so I've been playing for around 3 yrs. Gacha can be pretty damn bad, the first 5 story singularitys are kinda bad however it picks up on the 6th and onwards. F2P is good somewhat cause you can always make them stronger for harder challenges. My main issues are that you have to make sure you make a transfer code cause if you don't and let's say you wanna pick it up later well whatever you had is now gone since you didn't make a transfer code. I hope they will make it a bind system soon."
Beast mode...
I love fate go cause i like animes.
It's an enjoyable game xD I love the story and the characters. I'm a big fan of the fate series.
Working great
Love the game but the servants should get more hp since some enemies hp can go up to the millions yet servants hp don't over over 13k very unfair
Best gacha and the most F2P friendly by far
I've been playing since the beginning. And it has had a few rough times but I must give props to the people who work on this game it's amazing now. And I love how they keep it fresh instead of just letting it become stagnant like many games based off of anime do. I'm pretty sure this is the first 5* rating I've ever given.
Really good game to play. Recommended to friends.
I love this game!!!!!!
I love the game and the experience.
money for the gacha god.
Fun game great story üëå
great game just needs a better way a keeping data and transfers like Facebook or apple id
"Despite a phenomenal story, FGO is one of the least fun gacha games out there. The event structure is awful, with many limited time events so that players fear missing out will play more. The story content is awfully paced, filling it with more battles than necessary so you play more. Story content is extremely hard so that players will grind more, and there is no autoplay so you have to sit through boring repetitive grind. All so you are more likely to spend money. Just watch the story."
I love this game!!!
"""Fate"""
"This game beat me up while I was eating, and then it stole my wallet and my lunch."
"The game wont open for me!!! Uninstalled twice and can even play it at all. Even after the update, i can not even open the app!!"
"Gameplay alright, story and jokes are great, and the gatcha is very cruel."
This game was amazing but pls add percent of 5star servant in summon its not easy to gain saint quartz thanks
Its ok pull rates suck
"This game will be easy at first (depending on your luck at least). It will be tediously grindy and your luck might be insanely bad, however if you bear with it, the game grows on you."
"An Amazing Game ! I discovered it after watching Fate/ Stay night UBW , and instantly got hooked up to it ! Oh man I love this game , and Fate Franchise is my favorite one , and this Game is my favorite one ! üòÅüòÅüòÅ Thanks for this Amazing Game ! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
It's good but you have to farm materials a lot.
Awesome game. I love it!!
So far so good i enjoy the game very much
Got fixed
Pretty f2p friendly
The 5 star rating are so low after spending alot of saint quarts i got no 5 star but even though the game is still packing with hypes for fate fans this game is just not for players who are f2p cause of the low 5 rate
One of the best game you can play... Free to Play Friendly but too Grindy...
"Sometimes drop rate up is a very big lie. Although the story progression is very good. I hope DW would updatw 1* 2* servants, they deserve some love"
I love the genre and the tie-in to real history. Plus the game hardly ever glitches and if it does the support is quick to do right by the customer.
"my best Android Game EVER!!!! Special mention: Xerx Lime If your just gonna be a crybaby then don't play boy, I'm a free to play but not a die-hard fan And your cryin coz it's time consuming and hard? Then just play roblox or something Crybaby...üòÇüòÅ"
Awesome game. It keeps on giving!
I hate this game 5/5
Not good for unit drops i barley get any good charecters period not only that your grinding for some things is ridiculous also y can't I link my Facebook so I won't loss data
"This game is a overall amazing experience to play for a mobile game, even beating some games on consoles. The characters are loveable and really can be relatable. Also, some of them can even become iconic gaming icons. Gameplay is very addicting when you get into it, making you not wanting to stop playing. Story is very compelling which keeps a hold on you. Making you want to play to the bitter end. Even has some great music to listen to."
Nice and cool
"Overall FGO is a good game with a very acquired taste. Its gacha to the core, pull rates are extremely low with a stingy currency, saving for certains banners is your only hope. Gameplay is fun but outside of story and event its very grinding and can be very boring. Too off set the grind the game gives daily material login to help slightly. The story of the game is absolutley amazing in the lost belt chapters. The story is where its really at. I wouldnt recommend for inexpeirienced gacha players"
"No auto battle, no summon pity, terrible UI, outdated engine, zero quality of life for players. Great story, great characters, terrible chance of getting them. Could be a good game, hopefully they completely overhaul the train wreck, then it may be considered a good game if this were still 2015."
!!!RATE UP IS A LIE!!!
Rate up is a lie. Otherwise grear story most of the time
Yorokobe
Umu!
"It's boring and addictive at the same time. I don't know. It's challenging, really, once you get past some certain level and the main character will grow on you, that you ended feeling accomplishment with it. Like you actually safe humanity multiple times and become an overlypowered master ever to exist in Holy Grail War"
Give me ssr
"Fate/Grand Order has one of the best main storylines in my opinion for mobile games and I am happy with all the characters I managed to summon, good luck to all og you masters out there for your summons too üòÅ"
No ssr but still good
"Sorry but I have to Repost. But my friend is having problem connecting to the server and accidentally deleted his progress,I am disappointed because his account cannot be retrieved even with the code provided and the password he made he is really crying when he lost his account and progress he is at lostbelt 3 and has nine 5 star heroic spirit and seven 4 star heroic spirit that he worked on over 2 years.Hopefully you would read this and fix the problem.To all masters of chaldea make a codeüòîüòî"
"This game has an excellent story, with diverse characters and satisfying combat that is rewarded by diligence and planning. That said, it suffers from a few problems-- it's an exhausting grindfest for materials to level your servents, rolling the gacha has terrible odds for a 5 star, and free currency to do so is very scarce. Google gacha games before you spend money to know what you are getting into. That all said- this is my favorite game and I find it highly satisfying. Good luck!"
Rate up sucks 500 quart and not even an SR Ce for what
The game is improving. I pray it will and it shall endure i love it. The story is great as it improves! Low rarity and high rarity are pretty balance i love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Much try hard
Naisu story (‚âß‚àá‚â¶)b
Great game obly if you can withstand gacha hell
UwU it good
Love it play it every day
Yeet
The game now recieves better treatment
"Theres plenty of ftp characters that are very relevant and useful. Story is good, and emotional at times. Can be hard fpr a new player to get going since theres a lot of things that are possible to do, but theres always guides for that."
"Awesome game and f2p friendly, but there are still some stuff that needs tweaking, namely: 1) Friend support selection is weird, let us filter the friend supports through what CEs they have and remove the randomization of friend supports, it's annoying when I have to manually update my support up to 7 times just to pick the one I used last time. 2)Focus the updates on the much needed servs, such as the ones in the low-rarity."
"Fate/stay night ruined my life. This does the same kind of thing, but it releases dopamine in my brain while it does it."
"Gacha rates not withstanding (because seriously, this game's rates are hot garbage compared to other Gacha games), this is a pretty solid game, and a solid entry to the Fate franchise."
So much fun
"I just really like the game, has ups and downs but it has treated me well so far."
Been playing it for 3 years so its a good game
BOOBAS
Waiting to gogogogogo
"Love it, but gacha rates are...."
SSR PLEASE
Yorokibe shounen
farm
I hate this game. But im still playing it :> please this is a cry for help its been almost 4 years
It's not hard
cute girls
"If you enjoy the Fate series and just ignore the gacha for what it is, you'll enjoy this."
There are many cheaters using BMT
It has the best quality waifu
PADORU PADORU PADORU PADORU
"Quality game, gacha is meh, community is idk, tibbies are great, hot protagonists, epic NP clips, overall great game. Oh yea I liek those Tids G"
Probably the best Gacha out there in terms of story development
"The game itself is slightly above average, but the VN aspect & attachment to Fate grant more uniqueness. However, what stops me from giving this game a high rating is that it relies on RNG to get characters. If I want a character in realistic timespan, I must get unreasonably lucky or spend money. That's bad. I'd rather unlock characters purely by playing the game, & any character in the gacha, I'd like to purchase separately to add to the cards I can draw by playing levels. Story's GOOD though"
I love the game. It's fun and everything but I have sent your support for help on getting my account back yet no reply on the help of trying to get it back.
It's amazing
"A good gacha game with a great storyline and memorable characters. However, beware of the abysmal gacha rates and don't take it personally if you don't get your waifu/husbando. Take it easy and enjoy the game. Don't let the gacha consume you!"
"Not for ftp. You roll units with materials so chances of you even getting event units are really really low. Art is very iffy at times and gameplay consumes too much time I'd rather use elsewhere. Don't give much as prizes or for free in events or whatnot. Again you have to play for it most of the time, which is time consuming and very very repetitive. Would only recommend to a diehard fgo fan or if you're the type to like what I saw as a negative"
Buff/debuff success for mystic codes is bugged
Game keeps overheating the phone and lags all the time.
"Game is super fun. It looks simplistic but has a lot of mechanics that apply. Would rate 5 but the gacha is rougher than most games I've seen. Not enough of a deterrent to suggest against playing, but just disheartening time to time."
I loved the game and It's story but the only thing that reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I lost my account.
Too much grind
Haven't been able to login due to failure to connect to the server. Been 4 days in a row now. Internet connection is fine.
"One of the best games out there, I loved fate as a franchise (stilp do). Once I found out about the game? I was hooked immediately, They've got all my favorite servants, plus the story mode is amazing. They really have you interact with your servants as some point. Gacha pulls are always a pain but it's really satisfying when you get a 5-SS."
we need more free sq
Sepala data du rurubugu bada derujo bempak lakapu trisa kadutu debako so batu jono posa zate!!!
"Rates are bad af. The meme is real that this is a hell you are walking into. Not just the Gacha rates, but also the item drop rates (YES IM LOOKING AT YOU EVIL BONE). There are a lot of reasons why I should uninstall this game or say that this game sucks but.. HELL NAH. This game is amazing, screw the gacha, you can clear the game ez just by using any servant with proper team comps. SSRs are just for show. But the best one so far is the story. It carried all of the flaws in this game."
I'm very good game and so much different type of characters.
It has great servants and needs some strategic playing to get through some hard and challenging quests.
"This game is boring. I have no idea how it rated so high here. It's a bad story, poorly developed characters, and overly complicated introduction to the world."
cringe ass gacha game bruh
No pity + trash rates
"I'm bankrupt now, but at least I have astolfo"
"Absolutely love it. But if you dont like endless grinding pn events and pretty dated graphics, or dislike gacha as a system, dont play this"
"Generic gameplay, very good if you're a fate fan though"
I tried logging it in but it doesn't work. It always asks me to clear cache but it either takes long to load at the loading screen or it doesn't. Either way it doesn't matter because you just can't play it and it just keeps stating that there is something wrong with my internet connection even though my internet is just perfectly fine. And for about 5 days I wasn't able to play this game just because of this issue. I tried many methods to fix it but sadly... nothing just works.
FATE
I love the whole Fate franchise. This game is a really good game. I suck at it but it's still a very good addition to my Fate addiction.
Still love the game
Fun game. I took off a star for two complaints -- 1) Game unmutes sound without asking permission on start. 2) Recent event required that players be in an endgame situation in order to participate.
"Been playing this game for 2 or 3 years and i can say without a doubt that i really love this game (story and gameplay) Also, 5 stars because if you did encounter a problem, you can always ask costumer support and they are fast to reply Lastly, DW if you are reading this, im extremely salty, i always get nothing but just give me space ishtar and berserker musashi next year when i roll for them and really theyre all i need Again keep up the good work"
Great game have been enjoying it for years now
This is a great game when things go well for you. Gacha rates drain you and grinding can only get so many saint quartz. Ultimately this is a game that is unfriendly to poor individuals since you almost certainly won't get many good pulls even spending money. One big problem is the coding. Something about the coding in the servers cause all kinds of errors and it isn't hard to lose accounts due to lack of email binding. This is fun when it works. Too bad it has so much going against it.
"Great game, just the account isn't link to anything. So you pretty much lose all your data if your phone dies if you didn't save the transfer code"
Amazing! Not recommended.
Love this game ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very good game. I rate it 5 stars!
Love the fate francise.
One word Badonkers
"Good story but repetitive combat mechanics and of course gacha so good luck having units you want. If you don't care about which characters you have then this is a 4/5. Otherwise, steer clear."
Nice update
"The game is fun. But over relies on gacha (loot box) at times, over valued microtrandations, $1.50 au for 1 sq (premium currency). Can't say this game is not going to be a target for regulation around the world after EA is done in court for the same practices. The game really needs a revamp on rates and prices as well as alternative means to obtain rare characters, which are not gacha centralised. Its fun but the business practices are greedy like EA who are currently in court around the world"
Rates are low
"1.unf2p friendly. 2. Still a gacha thats very old school, pray on players with unforgivable drop rates.3. Same game since release.4. Lack of content. All you really just do is grind materials for servants with very little outside of story and event stories with some being story lock. In this day and age where many gacha games provide pity system to compensate for poor summon rates and provide more content. This game is still stubborn and refuses to change as other games from its era has."
The gacha is hell give us better droprates pls
I hate this game.10/10
Theres no option to login the account cause when i factory reset my phone and downloaded fgo back i couldnt get back to my original account.... rip my 5 star saber.
its just beautifully game
"Amazing game they've outdone themselves, this game is nothing short of being masterful. Edit: I came back to say... THIS GAME IS FREAKING GREAT!!!!! NEVER REGRETED DOWNLOADING THIS SINCE 2K18."
Event is pretty meh but overall a great game!
"Game is fun for a minute. Then you never summon anything interesting and all you do is grind in the same boring battles, which don't help you summon anything worthwhile. It takes weeks to get enough resources to summon and thats really the only reason you play a game like this. Missed opportunities."
I think it would be benfital if you would give the player a free five star character Of free 11 time summon.
Amazing!! I absolutely love this game. Although the only think I don't like is when I dont get a servant I want....but that is a gatch game for you.
"Story is top notch, other stuff are meh"
"Good graphics, interesting stories, best way to introduce the historical peoples, and the best RPG to the point that you can't leave the game. Well the GATCHA was pretty hard and I hope in the future maybe you could all make it more easy to get a 5 STAR and for sure many plsyers would be enjoy this game more. Anyways thanks for the english version of this GAME. :))"
I got lucky
"Terrible gacha rates! Like, really really bad. 100 summons and not even a 4 star servant."
Very pog!
great sucsess
Please release FGO ARCADE for mobile :)
"Game is fun but as time goes by I'm pretty sure some players will find it boring especially with that BS gacha rate. Fix the gacha rate! Even the servants that are on the banner is so hard to get with that BS gacha rate, all I keep on getting are effin craft essence how can I use those if I don't even have servants that's fit for those."
can you make the character rate's higher please it's boring that I keep getting 5star craft essence instead of characters
"Trash rates, Salt so fun"
"I do not recommend playing this game. 5 stars, 10/10 experience."
"They give out gems sooooo slowly, so they force you to spend money. I'm just trying to play as my favorite waifus, but I just keep feet dudes that I don't care about. I'm over it, I'll just play date extella or watch the damn anime!"
Don't work right
won't link to Facebook but customer support can retrieve your account pretty quick if you have all of your info memorized; this would definitely be easier if you could link it to Facebook
Fate games and anime I love both
Pogers
You would have to try it yourself. Completley subjective.

"This game has been a rabbit hole I've never been able to get out of. I picked it up because I heard a lot about it, and before I knew it, I was invested into everything - the story, the gameplay, and the franchise as a whole. I wholeheartedly reccomend anyone even remotely interested in this game to at least give it a try."
1/5/2020 my waifus are happy 7/13/2020 please skadi come home ive gone 250 sq without you
Easy to play and handles interrupted game well without losing progress.
Waifus make my bank look sad
It would be better if there is auto mode for daily grinding cause the battle is taking too long and not everyone have a lot of time in hands
Auto battle.. I would spend so much more time/money if you would just let us auto to clear repeatable levels. Not even needed for the story levels.. I love this game but would literally shift the majority of my gacha time to Fate if that happened.
It's a great game for fate fans
"Being a fate fan, All I can say is amazing! Finally its here! After the long wait where you can only view others playing this game specifically those from JPand NA, now it is made available to my country, and now I can play XD. Now finally a chance to continue the story of where that FGO movie left off. P.S. download this game I recommend it, you will feel as bitter as a love thats broken when your luck sucks, but feel as if the gates of heaven open when you get that rainbow"
"I love this game.which got me into even collecting figures of the characters itself.my only thing is,since there a lot of grinding,to have something as a blitz way of doing it.like I have a team of lvl90 great 5 star characters,I should be able to blitz it without dying...pls devs make it possible.i wanna get all my characters max lvl"
Can they please have discounts for celebrations?
It's a great game actually. Lost my patience.
Read the VN
I can't connect to the downloading server no matter what I do so I can no longer access the game. That's loads of time and lots of ill-spent money wasted. Fix your game.
Love Its. Mainly for weebs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also thank you for helping me get my account back!!!!!
"Great storyline, easy to play without pay to play. Very engaging with regular events besides a very long and interesting main quest."
"Best game, best girls, best show, best everything"
"trash, should be 0 but absolute trash"
"Good story, good characters, and bad pull rates."
Fate/Grand Order is good civilisation
"Have to rely on transfer codes to recover data and if something goes goes wrong, that's it. Game runs wonky on certain devices with random lock ups, and while I've gotten most of the rare characters I want without ever spending a cent on this game, most people are far less lucky and can spend a fortune on just one."
Fun and amazing to play
Amazing i love it!! (Nero best girl)
Sooo.... This is addictive. Huge fan of the series and love that you can follow along with the in story plot.
"Great game. My only issue is that the drop rates for 5 stars are abysmally low, but that's to be expected."
"Worst gachas rates of any gacha out there. Yet legitimately fun gameplay, and cute FATE/ waifus."
"take these stars so i can get some in return, my karma rises."
"Two years playing and still going through this journey, in my opinion this game offers a lot of F2P content yo can get 4* units and eventually get a 5* there are a lot of rewards for the new players, and for the veterans will be future missions and updates, campaigns with SQ and rewards, maybe yo can't roll in every single banner but you can get a lot of units and servants for free, the story is amazing and the art is excellent alongside an excellent OST, Lostbelt 3 is here now and Im superhyped"
"I enjoy the grind, historical characters, and story+events"
"Havin' a good time, havin' a good time! I'm a F2P player, and I use this game every day. I enjoy the Medusa sisters. Thanks to the devs for making this."
Banana
RATE UP IS A LIE.
Good time killer.
"F:GO is a great game and tie in to the fate series. They have some problems with Android updates, so be careful updating your phone, but the story is top notch. The gacha rate ups are a lie though."
"Story quality is average until chapter 6 (jumps to great).With Summoning, there's no safety net mechanic like pity rate when it comes to getting 4* characters or higher rarity. Game is beatable with the free to play/f2p friendly characters, however."
Great I think my luck is higher than average and that makes me happy tho I don't get them like how whales do
Awesome game!
Love the game. It's what I have always been waiting for. üòÅ
"I'm generally not a fan of F2P, mobile, or gatcha, but this is the one that I will recommend. The story is actually pretty good and the gameplay, while repetitive, is still pretty satisfying."
Just perfect. The gacha hell tho...
Awesomest fate game ever
"its a decent game, would be superior if they increased the chance of getting a 5*"
"Best Gacha Game I've ever played, I just love the gameplay, the storyline is amazing, I couldn't ask for moreabout this game, please make more FGO games, it really is amazing"
I can't seem to open the game right after the recent update. There's only a white screen. I hope this gets fixed asap.
dope anime. dope game
"I love this game, im not deleting it ever, my only issue is the framerate but legit i can look past it so easily, this game is astounding i love every bit of it and the story, even the gatchas lol its all beautiful i love every bit of it thank you so much devs!!"
A game where you enter gacha hell and still keep coming back and having fun great story great characters and f2p friendly
Being a fate fan i love the game but its just the rate up is kinda whack so if you want to play get ready to taste salt
Kwaoiuuuu
Interesting and fun
This is my 2nd account. I lost my very first one. Most of my faves were in the first account and i lost it when i got a new phone. I wish you'd link the game to the email address of the user's phone or facebook. It sucks to lose an account that you worked on and given much time. Im grinding this account now and hoping to get my favorites servants again. The drop rate isnt really bad but please link Atleast even just in facebook.
Worst game i played so far
I totally love this.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüíõ
This is Great
Beyond exceptional. I love the game
Great! Queen umu for the win!
Still not working with Android 10
"wonderful game, been playing it for more than 2 years already"
MORE SAINT QUARTZ!!! COME ON!!!
"Yeah, it's no less gatcha grind than many other games out there. But the graphics are astounding, the story is gripping, the events are frequent and have a lot put into them, and there aren't really any paywalls keeping content away from those of us playing on a budget. I can think of a lot of tweeks I would make personally, but they're more nitpicks than serious complaints. Overall, one of my favorite ways to unwind after a hard day, and a phone game that really has its storyhooks into me."
"This game is really good.The graphics,fighting,voices,etc.But I have one problem sometimes it says my connection is bad and I know my connection is good.I cleared my cache I restarted my phone I don't know what to do?!"
Addicting love it
Best of the best things in life
Its a intresting fun game only if your a fate fan have spare time and know what your doing update it feels like the servant pull rates have dropped alot so i gotta take a star off for it
it's like having a bad day. you get used to it
I love the story
Please make maintenance 69 hours long
Very amusing
Favorite game in the world played since March 2018 also play jp. Its an amazing game with an amazing story. People are just saying it sucks because they didn't get the servant they want
"The worst, yet the best gacha game out there."
I never bored playing this game.
Easy on the storage which I really appreciate
Nice game :)
Garbo summon rates
Horrible all around. Stole money from me too.
It's good and all but rate up is a lie and that's it
"While it is a gacha game, there are no competitive elements making it a chill game, that and customer support is very helpful"
Game is awesome! I started playing a little before the second anniversary and I have to say that I've never gotten bored of this game! I enjoy the story since it had so many unique and interesting characters. I also enjoy putting together a mix of different servants. Will always be a 10/10 for me.
Was great
"Being a fan of the series I had to try this game, that was roughly two years ago. This game is definitely worth the effort if you're looking to pass the time. Here's my warning, don't get too hung up on the summoning rates. Yes, the system has a low summon percentage but there are times when you'll get lucky. There are also a number of events that are starting to populate that will get you some pretty awesome servants. So don't worry if you couldn't pull who you wanted the first time."
"Drop rate increase is a f'ing lie. Don't pay anything into this game, spent 160 st quarts I save and didn't get the servant with the suposid drop rate increase. One of the rolls I got all 3 star so much for 1- 4 star guaranteed. Wish you can rate no stars cuz that's what it deserves."
"Terrible, 6 multi summons, 5 single summons, and 15 tickets used, and i couldn't even get Shiki, i will change this review when I get either the event Shiki or the banner shiki"
"Just play it ok I swear it,s good. And no hell"
"One of the best mobile games I ever played. One of the only game apps that I consistently keep playing. Graphics are becoming more amazing, battles are fun and keep you thinking, many many awesome characters to choose from."
Me encanta
Uhm i rate it 5 star because i love fgo they gave me cu cuchulain alter and Abigail Williams for 2 weeks only
The game is good but the most hate thing is their gacha system.
"I love Fate. Especially the characters. Favorite being Cu Chulainn. Emiya is cool too. Wish saint quartz was easier to save though. Other than that I unexpectedly found myself addicted. Usually not my type of game Great game, but the file just keeps getting bigger and bigger. My Samsung hit it's file size today and while I deleted a different app. I might have to delete this one if it hits it again and it's very saddening."
"its a Gatcha game, if you arent prepared then youll regret it, its a fun game if you are into the Fate series"
Its a cool game but i wish you can create a game like exos heroes or lord of heroes where the characters or the heroes are from FATE series anime ( or Fate/Grand Order ) üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
Got
"Mieo Luirancx, ocnruya Yuu Koito oallraocur?"
Jesus loves you
I like this one
"Got stuck on a white screen during the tutorial mission, when the Saber summon used her Noble Phantasm ability."
This game will be better if it go to ps4
Thank you for the opportunity to interview with you and your team for the animae you are letting me seeüòÑ
Please fix the game it lags to hard and sometime freezes when i click skills i just bought this phone and i know its enough to run fgo
Where the trap hoes at?
"Story is amazing, the game play leaves a lot to be desired."
I lost my account due to the device breaking and on the day I sent the email in the morning to support asking if they could recover and return my account to me. They replied back later on the same day sometime in the afternoon with a transfer code and password. Safe to say I was extremely happy with the quick response as well as getting my account back.
"Solid gameplay and story but with nice events but at thus point,im currently looking at different games 1. Difficult to transfer game data 2.while the gameplay is good, it can be boring and tedious at times not to mention multiple battles required to get a new area 3.the rates...why? You saved up 200+ quarts?,have 7 4* essence,this game has by far the single worst rates for characters i've ever seen! (And i played countless gacha games since 2012) there's also times the game randomly closes too."
I think I fixed this... Well anyways the game is good
"The ""Hey, that's Hell you're walking into."" line pretty much sums up the game"
"This game is so good in the long run, even now its still enjoyable to play. best gacha game so far for me and very f2p friendly. Jeanne line up all the way to end game haha"
"This game is very great to play! Although addictive it does bug out sometimes, sometimes I can't even enter my game because it'll just only show a black screen"
The dark souls of gachas
"Great game, though I wish it had PVP"
Very great game
This ia a real good app try it
"I love the game, it is functional and also entertaining and I honestly like it, if you wonder why I give it 4 stars. Well ... I don't like that you can only transfer the save data once, I don't like that to be honest. I hope that in the future that option will be unlimited."
"If this game had a voice over for the storyline, that would have been amazing!!! You get to see a lot of the servants in the nasuverse. Even though the gatcha system is tough on you especially for fgo, you can still run through most of the game with average 3 star servants. Just learn good team compilations and how to level them up and your good. As for the asthetics, the servant portrait cards looks nice. Wish the sprites were better though."
I like the animation and graphics of the game
I love u to gacha hard
Changed to 5 star review cause why not :D
Great thank you for giving my waifu at lvl 15 Plss developers add some filipino servants like andres bonifacio or like general juan luna. Thaw would be great.
"Solid gameplay, highly predatory practices. I want to rate this game higher because it has actual gameplay story & strategy. The big issue is the monetary aspect. Probably the worst of all the games I've played. You can spend hundreds of dollars & not even get a new unit or a 5* character/ the featured unit you really wanted. And this is something they are proud of. They never even have sales, or guaranteed drops/per summon like other games. Money could be better spent elsewhere. Get a Switch"
Game crash constantly
"It's a good game as is, but there are so many things that can be done to make it even better. So until those changes come until play it'll stay at 4 stars."
"Wish I could give a 0 star rating after wasting over 100 currency and not even getting a 4 star. Gatch rate is complete bs. I've never gotten 5 star from a 10 summon. I play Azure Lane too, and that game you can pretty easily get the characters you want without paying. Pretty much the only reason to pay there is for skins, which doesn't limit your gameplay like this game does where you can't get good characters without paying. Gameplay is also repetitive and boring."
Salty as hell.
Really good especially with noble phantasm
"It has pretty fun mechanics , style , and gameplay wise. Although the gacha rate is super terrible üóøüóøüóø. But overall , this game is a solid 5 stars for the story , characters , and events."
"A facc Ro cazz, stu giuoco √® na bomba frat√®."
Best game ever 10/10
"Hmmm Grand Order has a very well, not good connotation,"
I WILL NEVER UNINSTALL THIS GAME.... EVER!
There is a reason why this game is nicknamed gacha hell
"Most people complain about the terrible gacha rates, which isn't a problem if you can stick around and be patient with the game. Amazing story line and depth of character development, this game is my all time favorite."
I only play this for story. Dont care about ssr anymore since i wont get what I want..
"This game feels dated compared to many of the newer gacha games. Arknights, Genshin Impact, and Azur Lane blow it out of the water. Still good if you like Fate, though."
"Simply a Masterpiece of Creation by TypeMoon , Kinoko Nasu sensei's Masterpiece indeed!! It's full of lore and has great tension and atmosphere overall ! System control is simple enough but there is also complexity and strategy involved, yet still can be engaging and gives you challenge .Worth it 9/9 !!!"
The best doujin generator in the world.
"Fun game, really hit or miss, gacha is average 1%. Can't complain about rates, I knew what I was signing up for, boss fights give challenge when creating the right team Edit: Forgot to add the amazing story in this game, while the first part is rather boring at times, singularity 6 and beyond have great writing."
A lot of waifus 10/10 Gacha has been kind to me so 11/10
"Great if you really like the fate series, but you need a fat wallet to get the servants you actually want. Edit: You need a fat wallet just for a CHANCE at the servants you want."
Can you help me get my account back from a broken phone i dont have the stuff set up
Nice game with lot of content
Very good game good graphics but I can't take it with it lagging some damn much every few seconds so I'm quitting and playing another game
This game is great! That's all I have to sayüòä
I'm not addicted! I can stop at anytime I swear.
"It was one awesome ride, but still feel side effects of playing nonstop through the main story in a couple of months, but I got time to waste and did not spend real money to end the main story."
"There is one major problem with this game straight off the bat. Your account isnt saved to a cloud or backup. If you end up losing your file doesnt matter if it was by an accident or ur device broke, the developers obviously dont care. Ive seen people spend thousands on this game and when there isnt a backup its pretty much gonna be for nothingif something happen. Would love to see updates to link your progress to an account so when i change phones i dont hav to redo everything."
Pizza's you have to go out with me and you are a ton to do that for me too much to ask for a bit too much
"Rng is one of the worst, sure its fun but is not vry f2p friendly, so ply at ur own risk, being ur wallet growing a large sinkhole or u ragin on the gacha banners. But overall is a decent game in terms on graphics, control, etc."
"Been playing for about slightly more than a year now and I can easily say that Fate Grand Order is one of my favourite mobile games of all time. Great music, characters and story. Events are a blast to play through as well. If you like the Fate franchise or a great game in general, give Fate Grand Order a shot. Just be patient, in time you will get better."
"The support team got my account back. (I haven't logged in over a year and I forgot my transfer id) It took only two or so days. It could've been shorter if I had replied to their mails earlier (work is hell). Props to the guys in support that deal with dumbasses like me, they were polite about it too."
Grapics is good....but they should add more japanese language properly like the real japanese version!!!!
"It was great. But yesterday, I can't seem to open the app. It just keep saying that can't connect to server. I tried clearing the cache and ultimately tried uninstalling and installing it again but it never got resolved. My internet connection is stable and good but it keeps saying that can't connect to servers. Hope it gets resolved."
why is it black screen
I thoroughly enjoy this more than any other game app I have owned in the pass.
my exoerience in this game has been jewish but since they give me free 4 star i am now convinced they are no longer as jewish aas they seem to be.
Why is the 12 million tab not showing up in davinci's work shop I have beaten the requirement level ?
Love everything about this game. Wish it was on xbox !
Fun Defenitly not addicting ........
Something about the formatting is just weird but the story based stuff is alright
I've been playing this game since release a good game
"Pros: 1. Great story 2. All servants, even 3* servants can come a long way if you can strategize properly (you can play as F2P) 3. They keep older servants relevant, hence you can progress the story without having to roll for a new servants. 4. Regular updates with new content and events. Cons: EXTREMELY HORRENDOUS GACHA RATE My worst roll record is 1100 sq without getting a single SSR servant (you can do the math) It's called unlimited saltworks for a reason."
Love the story anf the thrill of when I get a rare summon or a completely random summon. Has anyone got child gil from friend point summoning because that's how I got him and it certainly surprised me.
classic FGO gonna delay and fk us over with the free 4‚òÜ again? it's false advertising if you say you're giving the ticket and delaying it btw
Awesome story
A fun game the story is interesting the gameplay is thoughtful and the characters *mwah* I know there is gatcha salt but it isn't too terrible and the community more than makes up for it. Not for everyone but I have and will continue to get my kicks from it.
"Played the game for a year, spent over 700sq and never got a 5 star. I gave this game a chance the story is ok, but the grind makes it boring. You are better off watching the new anime that are coming out for it. Friend played for less time and got 3 5 stars. I am F2P, but the prices for Sq are terrible as well."
"Stupid gacha, but nice gameplay"
"Story, events and characters have great story telling, but on the flipside compared to other gatcha games the daily and story/event rewards are as trash as their drop rates"
"To participate in certain holiday events, you need to complete late game story. Requirement Lostbelt 2. I'm not even halfway done to be able to participate in events.."
Truly this is the ONLY game I'll ever need on my phone. I only wish I was active enough to dedicate getting the characters I want to get and level them up! XD I highly recommend this game if you're into this sort of thing.
"I'm enjoying the plot so far, along with the interaction. Although I would prefer that they'll be an option for auto playing when it comes to playing the same stage."
This game made me care about a .jpeg
"Great game with great animation, voice acting, plot, and it has decent music. Been playing for a year and a half and the events are usually a hit or miss for me. The worst thing about the game is the gacha rate but that's to be expected from a mobile game. Do yourself a favor and try not to spend too much money because you will most likely come away unhappy from the encounter."
It is fate the goat
Guaranteed SSR Banners are nice
musashi
"I like the story, feeling it put out to for every character but the sad thing I don't like about it is that I can never get Karna"
"Been playing since God knows, really stylistic game that is really easy to get into but really hard to leave. Top rpg card game in my eyes, and you do not need to be apart of the microtranscactions to obtain high tier heroic spirits. Hope you all enjoy."
"The only mobile game I spend my valuable time on. Great stories, character development and scalable gameplay. A MUST FOR FANS OF THE FATE SERIES. I have EX gatcha luck so that helps my enjoyment. My daughter also plays and has C luck at best, many tears when her husbandos don't come home."
Fgo has been really stepping up their game
Hi i have a problem the 12 million dl campaign free 4 star hero did not pop up in the da vinci store please help meüò•
Would be a great game if 4 star and up servants weren't next to impossible to get.
I love this game But also hate it ive spent so much money close to 1k I think but God is it worth it
It is great so many new opportunities for new players and all around fun
It's just good.
"The real OG when it comes to gacha salt. Character designs are top tier, the devs are mad lads who either dry us up or spoil us rotten (look towards the skadi release event with the pure insane amounts of currency given out) and real memey/satirical dialogue that's been changed from JP to a certain degree for fun. The gacha is just gacha it wants you to spend big to win big even if you don't spend or spend much you can be f2p since the low rarity units are just as good or better then others."
4 stars cause love the game but gacha is awful :D
If you set out to actually roll for Servants then dont expect to get ANYTHING you want unless you pay upwards to $200 at times. The drop rates for the good Servants are incredibly low and they're usually the Servants you want. To top it all off a lot of them are event exclusive as well so you have a limited time to give the game all your money to get what you want
If you love Fate. You have to play this..
I am still bothered by the gacha rates but I dig the animations for my favorite servant kiyohime
"Great game, gacha so money sink enabled. That said, you don't need to spend a dime as not only are the f2p characters good, some of them are better than the SR/SSR characters, and thusly everything in the game can be cleared with those units. Story takes a bit to pick up, but when it does it yeets itself into the stratoshpere and doesn't stop. Very good game overall"
Its really fun the only problems i keep encountering is certain units dont show up after clearing a chapter and theirs no way to back up ur gsme data
"I love this games, interesting story, charismatic characters and so on. But, remember that this is a Gacha game."
Add autoplay in it
"Terrible gacha rates, 10/10 would still play"
Only game I on my phone! Great plot and graphics espy if you watched the shows.
I'm a big fan of the Fate series and in all I reaaly enjoy this game.
It fun
Seibaaaaaaaaaaasaa
This game is a fun exploration of the Fate Franchise and is completely free to play. Money does potentially boost your likelihood of getting better characters but because there is no PVP system this does not cause any issues.
"Will update when they get back to me, was kicked out the game when my phone updated and am unable to even play anymore edit: worked with support and they got me set up on another device, all is working well, just had to spam them a few times to get orderly replies game is a lot of fun"
Mm its vedy good
"Don't spend too much money, it'll be bad for your wallet!"
Wish the gacha was better but overall I'm enjoying the game. Put in however much you want. Been plying over a year and still haven't completed the main story but still got a roster full of servants without spending money so there's that.
"Good game, good story, bad gacha rate"
Love the fate series!
Good game the gind is real with this one .
Great game but it doesn't take long to eat up a bunch of space especially with it being updated so often. It is nice that they give the game so much attention so it's not really a bad thing that it gets updated so often.
"Everything is a lie. Live by the gacha, die by the gacha. If you want a good servant you have to roll for love and put it all on the line. Dont complain about your E- Luck when you havent even whaled. Git Gud."
It has a unique collecting feel to it while you get to play them in game with a cool art style
I am a F2P player and if you dont play for every 5 star character and plan ahead you will most likely get what you want. I myself have saved for 12 SSR characters and have got them all. If you dont like to wait months just to get a character then this is not the game for you. Also the story and gameplay is amazing so I think it's quite rude to rate 1 star only because you dont have the patience to wait for your characters.
"Good game, decent story with high stakes. Very good art. Needs more spiders though."
It's fun characters are interesting summons are cool wish there were more ways to get fragments to summon tho
"Story is cool, gacha is hell üòà"
I'll say that my account that i workee so hard for was lost!! And then when i went ahead and tried to go and give them an email they would say its not illegible or its impossible to retrieve my account because of another email saying it requested a recovery of the same fgo account. Not only that they immeduately gave up and didn't even tell what i needed to do!! That account is precious to me!!! I deserve that account!! I love that account!!! SO GIVE IT BACKKKKK!!!!!
"Good game. Read the VNs, Cowards"
A fantastic historical romp. Rate up is a lie but your lucky servant will come to you if you really believe
"""IT'S NOT PAY TO WIN, IT'S PAY TO WAIFU"""
"Only game I've played daily and stuck with for almost two years. Drop rates on the 5 star units are brutal and the English server gets a lot less freebies than the Japanese server does, but the story and gameplay are great."
It seems simple at first. But the gameplay became much more tactical when enemies became more diverse with status effects and skills. (Tbh I play for the story and gameplay) Plus you don't need to pay money for some fun. I'm a free to play player and I'm already in love with this game
Now i fixed my rating thanks for fixing the problem
"I'll be honest with you. I love the anime Fate/Zero, UBW, but this game was hard to get into in the beginning. Mechanics etc were difficult to understand so I actually uninstalled it twice. Tried again because a friend asked me to, and this time with him to help me understand, this game is one of the best time burner to invest in. Perfect."
It's so fun to play the graphics are awesome and it's perfect for an Otaku/Weeb like me thank you so muchüíô
"Hello, welcome to gacha hell."
Really like the Fate series. Thats why i love this game.
The storyline is amazing! The soundtrack is good and the graphics for the waifus and husbandos are neat.
I went through the five stages of grief in a matter of seconds. Great game 69/10
Arknights best game
This game turned me into a credit card
Boring game!!!! Repeatative gameplay. Graphics is bad. Story is Bad.
"Gonna admit, I'm shaking my head at those of you who dropped the game just because of bad Gacha rates. Though it's understandable that you'd be frustrated, but still. And to you prospecting players, the game is still fully playable even without the need of you whipping out that credit card. My advice: Play up to the 3rd chapter first, then make your decision. I promise this game won't disappoint. Lost your account and didn't make a transfer code? Customer support, 10/10 would recommend"
Thanks for the free 4 star :D
Rate up is a lie...but i cant stop rolling for the gatcha even if its a trap
BEST GAME EVAAAAAAAH
"It has unique storylines that keeps player interested in the game. This is one of the best gacha games that I played yet. Of course, this is F2P."
The doujins brought me here
"This gacha game is great, I've been playing for almost 3 months and I only have 2 ssr. I just hope their gacha system is more friendly like in the jp server. Too much salt lol"
Why did you removed split screen for it :c
Average
"This game is very good, I guarantee you. But if you can't handle a very low rate up on a servant, then I recommend you to play other gacha games. Because the rate up of this game is the trashiest of all gacha games, but what made this game beautiful is the storyline and the husbandos"
LMFAOOOOOOOO
CAN YOU ADAPT LAPU-LAPU IN PHILIPPINES PLSS
very epic. but salty people are very toxic and will stop at nothing to insult you and or your loved ones.
"For a game focused so much on story, it is WAY too difficult. I haven't even reached the dreaded Camelot and already I'm struggling to keep up. It's such a shame. I really like the story, but the gameplay ruins everything."
Rate up is a lie. Doesn't matter even the free 4* are useful in this game.
Pretty fun game started late but still very enjoyable. Story and characters in this game make me come back every now and then. Overall would recommend.
I like fate it's good haven't watched the full anime yet but hehehe I'm getting there
Great game!!!!
"Its too hard to login ,."
great game i download this because i just watch all fate series recently so im excited to play this
"I have had the game since July 1st, 2019 and JUST NOWMADE MY FIRST 5 STAR SUMMON! I DONT EVEN WANT TO PLAY THIS ANYMORE. OUTRAGEOUS. The work you have to put in just to see good summons is more difficult than any game in the history of pc , console,and mobile. I just wish you would give more summons out, maybe some free 1 a week or something. They got me put here for over a year just to finally see someone worth while."
Guys i want to ask if retrieving an account is possible?
meme
"Been playing for 2 years and while most of the gacha rates are insane (like 0.07% to get a 5-star servant on a regular day and 2% if it was rated UP), the grinding of ascension and skill mats are tedious, FGO is still amazing with the stories and characters. It's not some generic shounen story and the events are always fun to play. I only gave it 4 stars because the English servers always remove the April Fools event for some reason and the maintenance times are janky."
A good game and f2p friendly
It's really addicting
"The game itself is great, the story is unique, designs, quality and style is great, but the game keeps lagging and crashing, also the gacha is abysmal! The chances of you getting a SSR is so low, they do this to milk money but again it's a great game."
Strong storyline and unique battle mechanics. The only problem is the gatcha rate for 5‚òÜ units.
Fun gacha game. Do note that you may not get the character you're gunning for luck is involved here. Sometimes you get lucky sometimes you don't. Investment is rewarded in this game you can turn most characters good with enough investment and thinking. Communication with the devs is not very good and other forms like fan run Twitters or the r/grand order reddit holds better information. Again remember it's a gacha game and sometimes you just don't get what you want.
Its nice but is pain and suffering
"Really fun game. Great gameplay graphics and overall, very smooth. 4 stars because of the fact that the UI looks a little out dated and not my style, but definitely a game to look out for."
I have no money left
"Need more AP somehow, or golden fruits"
For some reason it always says that I have to clear cache so that the game will work.. I tried reinstalling it and clearing it's cache many times.. it still doesn't work.. my internet is good but I don't know if it's my phone or the game.. please help me fix this issue so that I can rate this game better!!
Camelot hits different
Can i have karna or king hassan as a gift for me
Sony supports terrorism so anything they make is automatically trash
I love it.. when I start playing it I was totally lost but when times goes by and play the game. I begin to love it.. continue u make it great.
Love the story and characters incorporates a lot of the Nasu-verse 1 downside is the summon system you gotta have some luck rolling on the characters you want for skills or looks or whatever you like about them. But still great game have not stopped playing over 900+ days later.
"A great game with an amazing story, the only problem stems from the gacha rates. However even common units like Cu, Arash, or Spartacus, can be very good and useful. An amazing game."
I love fate but tbh the essence rate to get compare to 4 to 5 stars if stupidly ridiculous
The staff are very helpful in regards to getting your account back and the gameplay is pretty cool with the characters having their own individual lines as well i personally find myself becoming a bit of a collector in this game as well.
Terrible game
Super Bad data tranfer system lost account because of it first you get a transfer number an a password but is it a one time use transfer number why I lost my account because of that
I have sold my soul to the gacha gods for summon tickets
"I am the soul of my salt. Emptiness is my wallet, and rage is my blood. I have summoned over a thousand servants. Unknown to ssr, nor known to salvation. Have withstood hell to acquire many saint quartz. Yet, those hands will never hold anything. So as I pray. Unlimited no life."
"I'm still a little new and I don't know what I'm doing, but other than that it's amazing."
The worst gacha game ever
I hate that I love this game
Fun af
"Really loved the story of this game, i hope that anime adaptat keep coming similar to the babylonia."
Its so Noce
Gameplay is decent and the story is decent as well as humorous. The only downside is that the gatcha rates are TERRIBLE.
Really good but it took $7000 for so one less star
love it and love the jpdates
"Pretty good, though the obvious Gacha rate problem stands out. Game engine could also use some mandatory updates that JP server has early... a couple app crashes, and rare instances of errors in the game itself, but nothing major. Overall, pretty solid, but could really use some of the Quality of Life changes that JP has early."
This sucks I cant even download it
Nice servants and stories except gacha hell
This game is my new addiction
haha
too much grind
Greatest mobile game of all time
Saber Alter best girl
"Been playing this game for years practically since launch and it's been a great time lots of fun events, good characters, and well written story"
Hot boys
Fun to play and this game has a tons of contents to enjoy and top tier waifus :)
Why I over 1 year I not get goldie servant.... That's make me want to throw my phone to the river or sea..... And make my wallet empty üò†üò°ü§¨ I hate this game.... I'm done with this game
"pretty fun game, but the NP animation is starting to get old and annoying. The developer should definitely include a skip animation function or an option to turn off NP animation for people that dont want to watch the same animation five thousand times."
I really love this game. I hope DW can implement re-runs of previous events. Or maybe I can purchase with Rare Prisms. I missed Kintoki (Rider) and I really really want one. Thank you.
Having some sound issues since changing phone to Poco F2
"When I first installed it, the game worked fine barring the occasional crash. Unfortunately, it got uninstalled by a cousin and my transfer data that I wrote down was damaged by rain droplets. No problem, I think to myself, I'll just start again.  Yet now it doesn't work at all. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, downloaded and redownloaded, but I can't even make it passed the beginning. It's sad because this is the one game I wanted to play and even this can no longer be accomplished. I can only guess the updates have screwed up more things than fixed."
Oni (Demon) gatcha ! Half a year rolling without getting what's on the banner and giving me hard to pair servants but the thrill of gaming this is addictive
"I love it, the game's amazing"
Great game üôàüôäüôâüòùüôÉ
"A lot of fun! Characters are well designed, story is engaging, has a good mix of humor and seriousness. Love the take on world history. And the premium currency is easy enough to obtain through playing"
For some reason the game wont load for me anymore. Its just a black screen after the intro. I tried waiting to see if it loads but I've been stuck on a black screen all night. Fantastic game though.
"Dropped my review cuz of the lack of Android system 9 support. It's been 
almost a month still no fix I've spent a ton."
Gacha is not that great in this game but its storyline is interesting...keep up the good work DW
"I did like playing this game but, after not being able to play due to some BS can't connect to server plus update, all my data was gone. I had even tried using the data transfer info, yet all I got was, I'd already being used. Was the second time my data magically disappeared so I've deleted the game and will not waist my time nor money on a third time. Right now I feel like ya don't wanna store data on the cloud simply because ya purposely want people 2lost data just to spend more 2 back up"
"First of all, this game is amazing! And I can tell how much time they spent to do this game."
Best game EVER INVENTED!!!.....As long as u have lots of luck or cash!
what a masterpiece
Rng really sux
Its so amzing I promise u its so good
It is very fun to play.
"You whale or you die. Waifu is laifu, and gacha takes no prisoners."
I absolutely love this game because im in love with the fate seires and this game plays well.
Mashu is great
Im addicted
"Game doesn't work anymore, it won't work with the new phone update"
Ok game
Fun to play. Yay
all i can say is l love it
So the gacha can be frustrating but overall the game is really fun.
Extremely well written and love the battling
Excelent chat support.
Items given for events dont work when they are supposed to on the days they are ment for. It's also really hard to get mordred or jack the ripper
"I absolutely love this game! Alright, real talk: it is an (arguably) pay-to-win waifu collection simulator. Beyond that, however, lies deep characters, a fascinating story, and a challenging strategy-driven game. People may be somewhat turned away by the gacha rates, but that alone is not enough to dismiss this game. With all said and done, if you want to play something fun and interesting that isn't riddled with marketing plots (rate-up doesn't count, shhh), then try FGO."
This game makes me very angry and depressed.
"Good game but needs a better gacha system, at least with the rates"
"Love the Fate franchise that I cosplayed as Astolfo for one anime convention held in New Orleans. Anyway, it's a cool game if you have a favorite character/waifu in the series lol I personally don't pick favorites Update: the only bad thing behind it is that I've to constantly uninstall apps on my phone whenever there's an update/new event coming up. Sooner or later I'll have to get a new phone."
"Very F2P friendly, fun to grind, characters are a unique and fun to use, cool and challenging fights, engaging story."
The best mobile game I ever played...been playing almost for 2 years now
"Clean graphics, fun mechanics, addictive gameplay"
Noice salt
I Like This Game
Great art and fun story
Very nice game but...
Nice game. addicted. I love it
Great storyline
"I'm sick and tired of sitting through an hour long tutorial where it basically forces me to press the stupid highlighted circle for and hour or so. there should be an option to skip it. same with the summons, I have to sit through the summons for 30 mins only to find out I got nothing worth while, how fun."
"The only online game that I loved that daily logging in becsme a part of my routine. One of the things that I loved in this game is that even low ranked servants can be used efficiently if you lack high ranking servants, provided that you enhance then to the best of their abilities. Though gacha roll is so difficult to get even one 4-star servant, for someone like me who plays this for free and for fun, I give this a rating of 5-stars. Nice gane üëç"
Skadi Mother F**ker
I love it...nothing else to say
"I know that the Gacha and the grinding might draw people away from this game, but if you look past it and get past to the story in america you'll know that this game has some of the best story that i've seen, not just by mobile game standart but to all stories that anime or visual novel can achieve."
Great characters
"Really great game. Really great story. Really great characters. However, I'm not a fan of the idea that my party don't gain experience from combat. Of course it's still a gacha game as well and as a result it's a money sink. Want your favorite character like Altria Pendragon, Gilgamesh or Jeanne d'Arc? You're waiting for a special event where they have a slightly higher chance to summon and praying you get them with your free quartz or buying quartz and still hoping you land the 5% drop chance."
"Been playing this game for almost 3 years, I've gone too far to back out now. Do yourself a favor and not fall into this Gacha Hell called FGO.... There is time for you to turn back..."
"4.5 gb to download full game, srsly??"
"Been a while appreciating this masterpiece, this is the true nature of ""gacha"", the storyline is just flawless, I commend the creator/s of this franchise. More years of success for this game, may you not grow tired of adding and improving this game that (not only me but also all the fans of the Fate Series), we love o' so much. 5‚òÖ for me because: unlike other gacha games I've played so far, this has the true nature of the word ""gacha"" game. That for me is reason enough to give it 5‚òÖ."
The game is good got nothing to say
Ruined my life. 5/5 will play again.
B√°tor B√°thory Erzs√©bet is the best Saber
The best Pay 2 Waifu so far.
Gacha gacha gacha?
"Used to run well with my home wifi before the summer event update , now I have to use my mobile data for this ...."
"Came for the waifus, stayed for the story"
More free saints quartz please
Great game even for a gacha. Plus you don't need 5star servants to win there for its not pay to win at all. Mostly the game is roll for your waifuu and play. Ill say it again its not pay to win at all. Even if you have all 5star servants in your party its not a garenteed win unless you use your brain.
waifu gacha game
"I'm giving this game 5 stars because I was already a fate fan at first. The game is really good for people who love gacha games and tedious farming. If you want a game that really takes a lot of free time, then this is the game for you!"
Salty Gatcha
"Needs so much memory storage (4 GB and counting) for so little animation, and regular updates keeps eating away more storage space. Started freezing up regularly in 2020 too."
"Played for Fate Zero, stayed for the story :)"
"The game is good, the soundtracks are good, and the graphics are good"
"Very F2P friendly, Low rarity servant is extremely useful for gameplay. The artwork is awesome and are still improving. Characters and their stories are interesting. Nothing more to say other than that this game is a sweet-coated hell. The rates are terrible by the way XD."
As a long time typemoon fan fate is lyfe.
Pls Raise the 5 star chancesssssss
"Leveling the servants need a lot of effort as they do not level as you play. This is the ultimate grindfest. Game not really suits mobile as you need time to play, the story part then gameplay takes a bit of time. Won't want to play unless I have a good hour free."
Great game I'm just addicted
"I'm not crazy for the fate/ series or anything like that and I didn't even plan to play this but GODDAMN Im hooked to this game tho I don't spend a cent in the game its still fun as hell, the game mechanics are the same as ever but the story is goddamn good. btw, you better add animation updates to some 3-4 star heroes especially Ushiwakamaru, I didn't really care until I saw Babylonia then I realized the animation is outdated, so.....pretty please game developer san"
I love this Game. Big fan of the Fate franchise.
"My experience playing this game was fun, I lost my phone so I lost my account and because we can't link to any social media platforms or Gmail like most games I'll never get it back, already contacted support but they weren't able to help even though I told them my devices.... I don't recommend this game to anyone because of that."
"The worst gacha I ever touched. Dropped after 2 hours. The rates are awful, the currency is awful, the gameplay is absolutely terrible, and the games graphics have aged very poorly. Surprised this gacha is amongst the top grossing. Avoid if you can. The story and characters are cliche anime, which is personally not my thing. I like the portrait art and some character designs (fran!) but thats all I can give this game."
Nice game very addicting
There is a lot to love here... Unfortunately it has one of the absolute most brutal gacha in the genre and barely gives out free currency. Very bad pull rates. No auto battle either making the game an extreme grind that demands your constant attention. It could be so much better.
"Constantly puts phone into sleep mode, about every ten to twenty seconds, making it far too tedious to play."
"Trash game,but i love trash <3"
"Gameplay is actually pretty good, can be F2P and still participate in events and progress in the story easily."
My favorite gacha game so far
"You'll cry some table salt here and there but in the end that's what you came here for. Seriously, the game can be played as f2p but playing for the sake of collecting servants is another thing..."
This is a good game with a little too much talking but you can skip that the game is good for beginners as well.
good good good good
This is the best game i ever play because i am fans of fate it nice and there are many beautiful characters
Played once had a good time needed more space deleted downloaded again doesn't let me connect to the server even tho i have stable connection so that's my problem but its still a good game just wished i can play it
"Ive been playing this game for a long time now for almost 2 years now and even tho gacha rate up is a lie, they still improve game by adding more story and interesting characters. Since I also play fgo jp there are a LOT of interesting elements are going to be added in between and after the 2 years gap. Looking forward for content TM and DW and as always thanks for the game! ps. np skip when?"
Been a fan since FSN eroge days... Fairly challenging and FTP friendly.. Don't really need LSSR or SSR to play the game properly but it sure makes it easier
"Very fun and generous, but horrible drop rates so save up as much as possible."
"I've spent so much money on this garbage because the gacha is terrible, but the story is decent. The only reason I'm still playing is because of the money I've already sunk into it."
Im addicted to this game
I would recommend this to those people who watches anime
Best game 10/10
The game is fun and it has a great story and soundtrack.
Best game i dont why but i cant stop playing
"""That's hell you're walking into"" Shiro probably."
"Please speed things up, two years behind content is sad"
„ÇÇ„ÅÜÂáÑ„ÅÑ„Åß„ÅôÔºÅÔºÅEXCELLENT GAME!!!!!
it is what it is
Loveeeee it overall. Please add servant Charlemagne!
whaling for waifus
HUGE ANIME MILKERS
"My go-to standard for mobile games. Fantastic story and a great addition to the Nasu-verse. It's worth playing through if you're into Type-Moon, even if you don't plan on spending any money. Gacha rates are harsh but the production value put into many 4 and 5 star servants makes them feel worth rolling for. Above all, the gameplay mechanics are fun and engaging without being overly complex or easy."
Pain just pain
I just finished lostbelt1 right now but i wasn't given the 10 saint quartz reward!!! What happened? Im so disappointed. Im a huge fan of this game. Pls fix this. Man it's depressing.
Really fun.
I need help. My fgo won't play cause when i clicked the clear cache that the moment when my fgo stop playing. Well i can run the game but the problem is that when i clicked a singularity it stops only at the earth with a blinking red light only there not moving its anoying me pls fix it
WHAT A GOOD GAME ! üôÉüôÉ
"this game is Great, i can learn a ton of history from this game and (relearn some that i already know of), the battle system is great and also the story of it is so cool, and as someone who watched the series its fun to see characters interact with each other,5 stars!!!"
"This was the first gacha game I've ever gotten into and this game, at least to me, gave me an experience far beyond a simple high for rolling for a waifus and husbandos. The main story in this game that's been continuously developed has drawn more raw emotion and heartbreak and hope from me than most books or even movies I've seen before, and it really just gets better as the story progresses. Play for your waifu, play for the story, it's really up to you on what you choose to get out of it."
Game is good and it is addictive I have no whatsoever problem with the game performance. Therefore I am hoping that you guys will give some more opportunities for players such as the f2p.
i gave 5 stars now give me a 5stars
The only thing that i really complain about this game is that it's overpriced saint quartz and GOD THE GACHA IS HELL
"Spend bunch of money on it then lost my account, try to contact customer support several time but to no avail. Were living in a year 2020 yet still no account save function."
"I've been playing for over 5 years and still love it. So yeah, it's good"
"Beware, a game that makes you fall into madness! Your hands might not be able to hold a ssr, or you might be able to. The Unlimited Salt Works"
300 bucks for Okita alone.
"If you're wanting to play this game because you saw a rare servant you wanted to get your hands on, let me be the first to tell you not to get your hopes up. While the gatcha rates *are* downright evil, if you don't really care about that all the servants 3 star and up are perfectly usable for the whole story. The one upside to the ultra low SSR rate is that SSR's really do feel super rare. The story has been really enjoyable thus far, on par with a high quality visual novel. You can sink as much or as little time into this game as you want and there's no need to spend any money at all if you don't want to."
"The only bad thing I can say about fate/go is that there's no mercy system in the Gatcha, otherwise it's a great game"
"It's a basic game but can be fun for some people, just watch the anime first."
This is the best and amazing PVP games ever played also a big fan of all the movies and animes of the Holy Grail War if you're a fan you will love the game for the style and characters
The gatcha is a nightmare.
Great game. Needs faster animation updates.
"It's a neat little game but the cash for credits system is a bit pricey. excellent story elements but some areas could use a little touching up. If it wasn't for the free gapture and in game free credits you'd never get a servant. However it is a long haul game, while it encouages casuals, if you want to keep up with events you need to play hardcore for a bit."
Damn i dont have any 5* servant
The best ever game to exist
I lost my account due to negligence. Even though I am free to play customer service was super courteous and prompt to address the issue.
"This game is fun for any fate fan. But beware because it has the potential to be a money sink. My only real gripe is the gatcha rates but it can be mitigated as well as the fact that you don't necessarily need 5 stars to clear difficult content but they do make it easier. It has been the only gatcha that I have played consistently for 2 years. It is also loads more fun with friend so you can compare with. Also multiple play styles to choose from in buster, arts, quick."
Stole all my money and never gave me Summer B.B.
I'm in school right now but it's a really fun game I'm playing it right now I put my brightness all the way down you could just Facecam
Very very fun and needs lots of strats
"The game is great in my opinion, I currently have played it for 2 years. the gacha rate is really bad but many of the low star characters are enough to play through the story with moderate investment. would continue to play as long as I like!!!"
Such an amazing turn based gacha game. With saber face in all of classes. The only downside is the ssr rate up which is very very small haha.
"This is stupid because y'all given us only 12 days to complete the events. Make it longer give us more days, because this is unfair to all of us."
The Best Game For Me!!! AND LINK TO GMAIL OR FB BE AVAILABLE PLEASEEEEE
Increase drop rate thats all
Love everything about it ESPECIALLY Vlad
Waifus!!
i love this game.
I've always been a fan of the Fate series and this game allows me to be an actual master in Series
The game improved a lot but the gacha is still the same.....
it does work on my chrombook 11
I wish there was a pity system
This is the perfect game ever I finally I got something good to play my luck ran out roo bad I draw nothing good that would would love an archer ishtar I like too review
"I love the characters, pretty simple combat strategy to look at"
Amazing but lost all my money on bad rolls thats why 4 and not 5 sorry.
Love this game playing all day everyday however i have something that i would like you to add and its the onr thing that all games have it is patch for fullview display patch because the most of new phones have the gull view display and without that patch we have some black lines in the sides of the game let me describe it better the game screen is in the center of our screen and we have big black lines on left and right side of our screen but if you add patch it will be fixed plz add itüôèüôè
"So it's based off the fate series (duh), but my gosh is it amazing. You dont need money to play. You can log in at any time and still have fun. There's a massive story line that is actually entertaining, and all the characters have a personality of their own. Amazing graphics with animation! They have events often for players who complete the storyline which make it even better! I've been playing for a while, jumping in whenever I'm bored. 5/5 because it deserves it!"
Keeps crashing in android 10
"Love the franchise, very much enjoy the turn based system. Reminds me of playing final fantasy as a kid."
I have been trying to update it but it wont work but its not my wifi cause i can still update other stuff
Great fun with a deeper story and combat than you'd expect. It's gatcha mechanics get in the way
I've tried a lot of different mobile games in my life but Fate GO stands out as a stellar example. The story features many great moments and the game features many different and interesting characters and art styles. It isn't flawless by any means but I genuinely recommend it as a quality game.
The best gacha game ever. I'd love to stay but I wont have much free time anymore.
"If your a fan of waifus and/or fate then you will feel right at home here. The story in true fate fashion takes it's time to flesh out and the gameplay, while old-fashioned, is solid. Every servant is viable, but it will fall on you to come up plans to win with them. Or you could look up strats from...other sources. Events do give out free 4 * servants sometimes so watch out for those. Be warned though, gacha is hell and the grind is real."
"Good game, im a fan of fate series I've been playing this game for almost 3 years. Good storyline and ost. The gacha system is literally hard which is good for me. Getting an ssr that hard is what u can really call ssr. I also like how easy the gameplay is and it is all about strategy which is also good for me. Even it needs a lot of investment."
Spent $30 on Saint Quartz for a guaranteed summons of a five star special summons character and didn't get the character in the summons. Absolute bull and I will never buy Saint Quartz again
The gacha to end all gacha. It giveth as it taketh.
Thank you to the people that made this game...i am now back to playing it after years... The gacha is so bad...totally unrewarding.. This game is making me work on it
Just playing for the waifu
SEIBAR
"Summoning is a joke. Summoned 50 times, and only got one 4star servant for the trouble. Game would be so much more enjoyable if you had even a slightly higher chance of pulling a 5star servant you actually want."
Love the story hate the way they take a thousand fu*king years to fuc*ing update it.
If you're a fan of the Nasuverse you'll probably love this game.
Jeanne archer waifu
It's ok.
Informative
Might change later idk
you either like it or hate it
Pls gimme a 5 star
I game is currently crashing way to often to the point where I can't even login. I have a Moto G7
"Game's fantastic. Lotta farming to raise characters, excellent OST, great art, though the file size is getting out of hand. Gacha isn't bad either. I've played for two years, never saved for a banner and have about 7 of the rarest characters. Not that you need them to progress. You can level anyone up to 90 with an item gained in game and some of the middle rarity characters are better than higher rarity ones."
Nobu best girl
Love this game thanks to the people who made this
Cant get a 5 star character
This game made me spend my money. I wonder why I still do it to this day
"After 2 years since my last review, FGO is still a good game."
Love It Too many Salt
Gacha System is bad.
"Very well designed game. Never crashes, always fun new quests, events, and updates. Enjoyed it for over a year and no plans to stop playing anytime soon."
"One of the best gacha game around. The gameplay is simple and easy to understand although a lot of the battle mechanics need a bit of research, otherwise it's fine. The storyline is just top-notch especially starting from Camelot arc and beyond. The gacha rate for SSRs is quite abysmal and alot of people quit over it, however you don't need high rarity to clear the game or specific units to clear quests because all servants are usable with a bit of planning."
"Honestly, it is surprisingly addictive, especially if you're the type who just loves gacha"
"I love this game, but the gacha system is GARBAGE"
I love everything thank you delightworks & typemoonüíó
"Usually, I hate mobile games. The gacha on here is near abusive in its difficulty. However, the story is incredible and no ads. It's an amazing game."
"I'ven been playing for seven months now and participated on the events. I loved that I can acquire a 4star heroes just by finishing the event story. Though I would like more guys/men in my team ‚ô•. I love the beautiful art, the voices and the story. And I feel extra stiffy when I got a hero/servant that others don't have. The game is very beginner and freeplayer friendly. Oh, I got Carmilla in my first role by the way ‚ô•"
this game is very good but it's bad civilization
Its interesting
"My account with 8 ssrs disappeared because i didn't saved it- but meh, had to do a fresh start. Anyways, good game."
"I love this game, I just wished events were half ap since you go through ap so fast and I wish there was a way for new players to get event characters/ce they missed besides reruns because even then you could still miss those events. Most can't even participate due to lack of characters or having to meet specific story progression, also wished that item drops were doubled because we've all struggled to get the ce drop and could go the whole event without getting it but just a suggestion."
"This game is simply amazing. The story is pretty oof in the beginning but it gets a lot better after the 5th singularity, especially now that lostbelt is about to release. The only thing thats kind of annoyoing is that you have to grind quite a bit for resources such as SQ or Ascension materials. The gacha rates for 5 star servants and even 4 stars servants are absolute TRASH, but thats what makes it so fun and exciting when you get your desired servant. Overall my favorite mobile game."
Gacha hell... send help...
"Baru juga grinding, disuruh update. Memek"
Great game for a great franchise
i love fate series and this game lets me understand more into their stories
Nicee
4 star is so hard to get imagine 5star
Just good
Depressing when months worth of saving amounts to nothing. Wait till 5th anni for the first real free 5 star. Even then its a select pool which amounys to just picking El Melloi/ Waver. If they could be more generous woth saint quartz that would be fine but you get like 5 or so weekly. Not worth summoning unless its Gssr which still requires you to pay. Im still gonna play cause of sunk cost fallacy.
"Fun game. Great story and as a Fate fan. It makes it that much more amazing. Just be careful if you have a gambling addiction. The Gatcha could really hurt you there. But again other than that, great game! üòÅ"
"Changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars the game has bugs and i cant play because it says ""cant connect to the game server"" even though my internet has high speed and i can read manga fast without even downloading it pls fix this bug i cant even play okeanos properly man."
It's fun and has a great story but if you want to get your favorite servant you have to put that money in also I hope that this learn from Azur Lane and let us save our account the feeling of losing an account you put your money blood sweat and tears in is something that will make some people stop playing all together
"Too much time spent for so little reward. The Gacha system has ridiculous odds and after saving for months I still got nothing. Gameplay is boring and requires you to do the same thing over and over and over, specially during events, and the rewards you get for clearing the event shop can barely get a few skill upgrades, or none at all"
Pokemon if it was anime girls.
"I like it, but i think ü§î cu is too op now because you buffed him for a couple of times."
Gg got BB chan and Miss XX for free~
"I'm a fan of the fate series, and this game expands the universe and adds so much more. First off, I will say the game is grindy but any game worthwhile is rightfully so. The game has many nodes that make it easier to grind certain materials if you know where to look. This game rewards those with the dedication to continue on with the story and their servants and is definitely shown in their events. Overall wonderful experience and continue to play and have max ascended a few characters . :)"
"The first few singularities are a little bland, but it definitely picks up. The various art styles are also a nice touch. From what I've seen, this is one of the more F2P friendly gacha games. The game offers many chances to get in-game currency without paying and plenty of lower rank servants can get you through the story."
It's great. You can not spent money if are intelligent. And if you reinstall you can restart. Its great
"It's a decent game, just don't give into the whale mindset and spend hundreds if not thousands on it."
This is my favorite gacha game
"If i could give you zero stars i would, because your recent update ruined my account and now im level 1 and i lost all of my 5 star characters x( Im super pissed off especially because i was almost at level 150 and i was about to do my last ascension for a 5 star character until i got message for an update that wiped my progress away when i updated my game, what a waste of everything."
"Really good and fun gatcha game, but lacks cloud saves which can suck real bad if you lose or break you phone/tablet and can't recover your game data so you have to start all over"
Musashi lvl 100 10/10/10
"One of my all time favorite games. It expands on the fate series and is fun to play. Its free to play so id suggest you try it of your even slightly intrested,"
"Game is fun to play time to time, the drop rates need to be a bit higher though I've spent 90 saints quarts I've saved up and all three of those rolls had a 3 star servant and the rest was craft essence."
"As the other reviews have said it, the Gacha rates are absolutely trash. HOWEVER, this is one of those games where you easily progress through most of the game and events with even 3* units."
Love jt
"Most people say that the gacha is horrible, and while the rates are really bad compared to other gacha games, there are a good number of non-four/five star servants or free four stars you can get that make it so that even 2 years into the game I still haven't spent money. Play for long enough and don't be dumb with your Quartz, and you'll get the servants you want eventually. The story is very good imo, and I love how it plays dearly that even though it's older and it shows, I will keep lovingit"
"This game is awesome! My wife & I both have been playing this game since late 2017. We would agree the gacha system could be a little better, but we do pretty well and we don't just grind all day. We maybe play a couple hours a day/night if that. We also don't spend money on the game. From what I can tell from reviews, is that most of the people complaining are people brand new to the game and just want it to be super easy to be super awesome without really putting in time. That's all I got."
If youre wanting to play as a free to play person its a slow grind but absolutely possible to have that way. I had a lot of fun just using some of my favorite servants from the show. If you dont get the Servant you want you could borrow it from the support list and possibly even friend the person who has it.
"1. This gatcha is known for being stingy on gold servants. Which would be a problem except... 2. You don't even need 5* Sevants if you put in the effort with what you get. You'd be surprised with what 3* and lower can do with work. 3. You can earn Saint Quartz by log in streak, doing story mode, or events. 4. F2P's gotta spend their quartz wisely. There's no promise you'll get what you want. Look stuff up and learn to plan. 5. Screwed up? You can start a new game by clearing the cache."
If you are Fate/Stay this game will be a great fit for you. Play much like visual novel with RPG elements. Really enjoyed my time with it. Would play at anytime.
So many hours and a lot of fun this game is my fandom and my addiction. They give you better servants in events and such easier than the gacha. But I disagree with the gacha hell claims. Edit: Still after three years of play i can still say fgo is the only mobile game to keep my attention. A few points I would like to add is how the 4 and 5 star servants are not the only good servants in the game and that the 3 star and below are just as viable to use as any 5 star.
Fun and i love it
Love this game!!
Ê±ÇÊ¢ÖÊûóÔºÅÊ±ÇÊñØÂç°Ëø™ÔºÅÊ±ÇÊúØÂÇªÔºÅ
I was gonna give 5 stars but I retracted one due to the fact I did not get Edmond Dantes in his last gacha.
Good game I just want up to date with jp
"Very addictive game, I love it. The story is really compelling and I like the strategizing required in the battles. There are so many great characters in the Fate universe and I was lucky enough to get my favourite one (Gilgamesh, and both versions) in this game. Don't skip the cutscenes, because this game really makes you feel things!"
Its cool.
Fun but the game has errors way to often
"As a fan of fate series, the story is superb. Some people complain about the gatcha but it's what makes them earn money. This game is made for fate fans and we love it."
Hot servant xd
It is a fun game.
"750 days in, 500USD later, still a happy player"
"Great story, with great art. Gameplay's easy but hard to master. Best part is, unlike other gachas, your 1-3 star heroes are actually still useful and not just fodder."
Best mobile game I have ever played.
"This where i grind for exp for my fave servants ...... And patience, a lot of it."
"This game is practically for FATE SERIES FANS! Otherwise, you will find it hard to love FGO. Gacha System is ""Garbage"". F2P or P2W, you need LUCK to get the SR and SSR servants you want. 1 to 3 ‚òÖ servants are also as useful at Max Lvl. F2P-friendly. It's Grind over money. The only thing you can buy with real money is Saint Quartz for summoning. As for the materials, you grind. Events is best grinding ground. Lastly, story-rich. If you're into TypeMoon series, the stories are all connected."
"How to play: Just get lucky. Option 2: Bring out Wallet-kun. (People complaining about the low rarity servants doesn't deserve to play this game. Also, if you make mistakes, its your fault and not the game's. And why complain about buying resources to spend on the game? Its a GACHA game. Get out of here.) *You can start a new game. Just clear game data."
When is it launching in the UK
"The gacha rates suck haha, i love the game tho"
"This game is great. They introduce new characters all the time. They have fun seasonal events. It's possible to get all the characters you want without spending money as long as you're not too greedy and play smart. You can level up and use your characters immediately. They give you a lot of free 4* servants that are good. I've been playing for 4-5 years now. I played the Japanese version, so it's nice to actually be able to read what's going on."
Welcome to the hell of gacha y farm
I've been playing for 500 days now. fgo is a phenomenal game with interesting lore and characters. i wouldnt recommend it if you cant handle the salt tho.
I hope they fix the UI and give animation update to old servants
NO SSR REEEEEEE
"I love the game its a good time waster, and the gacha is has been very generous to me being a FTP and all. Always go for the free 4 stars as many of them are better than some 5 stars, and well if were being honest I only really like the game because my favorite servants ishtar came to me sole one ticket summons. And same with ereshkigal so im probably being biased. Anyway gatcha rates are fair. Lmao"
My luck is pretty good so i get all 5 stars i wanna roll for without having to whale
"I enjoy the game very much. I have been playing for around 9 months and I love the events, in particular. I am mostly an F2P player but I buy SQs to try for some fate husbando materials like Arthur, Cuserker and Archer Gil, still no success though ü§£. Although, I also get good 4 and 5 stars out of free saint quartz sometimes, so not really complaining."
"Lost my account but customer service was great they helped recover it twice. Great game too, keeps you busy if you're looking for grind distraction and cool characters"
"Got Ska√∞i-sama, Thanks a lot DW"
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡πÇ‡∏á‡πà
"It's a really enjoyable game to play during your free time. Despite it being an old game, it still manages to get you invested, with it's use of story and different character/abilities. With many fan-favorite characters, it's not unusual or suprising for one to start to become invested in a game like this. After almost 2 months of playing this game, I will say that I have never once considered this game to be 'boring' or 'not fun'. If you want to immerse yourself into the world of Fate, play it."
we all know why we're here
>censorkeks
The only time i feel like i have ex rank luck in gacha game
FGO is fun
This game enraged and fascinated me for a whole year. I will hyperfixate and trashtalk this game until the inciniration of humanity.
Trash Game
My personal favorite mobile game i could grumble about the gacha side of it but honestly it's a pretty fair system.
It's gacha hell but I'm lovin my waifus
This Game Is Fun And Cool üòé
"To me, it's pretty cool and exciting cause like I'm a fate serious fan lol"
As far I remember i have been and always be a fan of Fate series even this game is very interesting and I enjoy a lot with the help of those great artist making those art is a plus for me and the battle system are so great.
It's a fate mobile game.
Gacha system sucks
"Gacha is balanced. Obviously better rates would be nicer but I'm free-to-play and have still managed to pull a lot of 5* ssr servants. A lot of people complaining about the gacha, but it's actually fine. Good game."
"I love this game so much, even as a f2p you can also progress very high at story modes and challenge quests"
Gacha is poopoo. That is all.
"As a huge fan of the Fate series, I really wanted to experience this game for myself. The gacha rates are tremendously low, but this game shows you that you don't need expensive units to win a fight. You can easily cheese a boss with low rarity servants and the right setup. It gets really grindy at times, but that's to be expected of when you have many servants to level up."
Its was working perfectly but not it's not trying to load and I dont want to start over again what should I do
To all EX rank player damn you guys are very lucky that's included myself and to all E luck player or below just survive dude and that's also included myself üòÇüòÇüòÇ . I say that cause i have 2 account and 1 of them is luckier than the other
"I love this game. Fate fan or otherwise. The story, the OSTs, and the gameplay are amazing. Some of the music sends chills up my spine from time to time. The gameplay is pretty tedious, but I wouldn't recommend playing this game 24/7/365 otherwise you'll get burned out. I'd recommend to at least play until the natural AP bar is gone. This gacha game is one of my favorites, but some times I feel like they should space the events out with a one week break so it doesn't feel like a barrage."
I just lost my account after update what the hell I want my account I tried to get my account even after sending e mail but nothing helped please given me my account
"You make it impossible to log into an account I had previously. I put work and money into that account. You also have no auto button. Yeah its ok to fight manually, but i work 2 jobs. Dont have time to do it all by hand. Do some quality of life enhancements You get the 1 * you deserve."
If you enjoy fate franchise and servant lore this game is a good way to discover different servants. Don't mind the salt be f2p and enjoy whatever you can get. You don't need ssr servants to finish story content.
"Favorite app. The gameplay is fun and allows for building a team that employs whatever type of moves you prefer. With a strategy and some lucky pulls, you can dominate. The story is engaging and honestly, really is great for anybody who enjoys anime."
"Bought items, got triple charged. They refused refund. Do not buy anything!"
The game is fun and great to play but getting the crystals to use the gacha is a pain and even grinding isn't helpful because half or more of your energy will be consumed trying to get crystal and then the gacha function is hell unless your family works at the studio making the game you'll rarely get any good servants even if you do use the 30 gems feature also if you're a free to play you better save the gems until you see a banner that you really want to spend 30 plus gems on
I can't stand the animations. Look janky and awkward
"Excellent story, excellent characters and having different artist makes the art refreshing but be prepared as gacha will make you saltier than dead sea."
"Unless you know exactly what you are getting into, i cant recomend this game"
People have sold their souls for this game servants. Worth it
Great game with a great background and lore base; art and playability are superb. But after a while youre AP starved. Me for example can play 15mins a day and then have to wait 12 hours for another 15mins.... thats not good at all
Addictive and make me keep come back to it. but when will it link to Google play? I got to replay from star about 3 - 4 time already because I lost my transfer code.
MMMMMMMMMM.... YES GACHA HELL
MMMMMMMM..... YES GACHA HELL
"This game is very good, you all have to try it‚úå‚úå"
"Gacha system is abysmal. The chances of getting a 5-star servant are the same odds as sticking your index finger into an electric pencil sharpener and it coming out unscathed. I've wasted hours and hundreds of summons only to get absolute garbage, which is really sad, because I genuinely liked the story, characters and gameplay, but the game had to be ruined by a gacha system the likes of which could make the most sane man tear the hair out of his own head. Good game otherwise."
The gacha is unforgiving but you can win with free servants.
GLIZZY
Great game but too much salt and mats are hell
"I wanna give you 5 stars. But I hate the ""Data transferring"". Last time I accidentally broke my phone, I did not get a chance to transfer my data to another phone. üò° IT WAS REALLY SUCK"
FGO is the only gatcha game I've actually stuck with and I've played it for almost a month now day and night. The game is rewarding in many aspects as there always feels like there's something to do.
"I havent been outside in 17 years, I have not seen a woman in 15 years. Saber only(visibile pain)"
"The Gacha rates are bad, the farming phase is also bad and droprates is a lie, 5/5 since i like the game very much."
I don't recommend this game
I love this game I wouldn't have it for this long if I didn't
"Its quite an enjoyable game, although it heavily leans on the Pay-to-Win style, its still very fun. I enjoy the Fate anime series and this is a great game to satisfy my cravings. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Time sink for whales. The storyline seems fine, but the gameplay is boring. There's no real customization, and no it feels useless to get new characters. Bad pacing brings the game down."
"Good, bit pay to win but really good."
I love the characters and story. If you want a game to where fall in love with the characters' personalities this is the game for you.
"A few months back I reached out to customer support and after a few emails, some hard questions and a receipt, my account was reinstated and given back to me. Super thankful and appreciative. Note to the wise!! Keep a screenshot or something of your password and number after you set it up!!"
most addictive waifu collector
1 tix 1 ssr
"Despite the fan art, most in game art looks to be from 2013 with the UI looking like something designed for the iphone 3G. skip this and play a dozen better gacha games"
Super fun game to play am having too much fun with this game Reccomended for those who like the fate series but i wont steer you away if you like rpg games the story is nice and the chracthers are awesome P.s Remember its a gacha game and RNG is still RNG as long as you remember that you will be fine
"A little bit grind heavy, but otherwise a very good game with an interesting storyline."
Too much p2waifu. Run
"Cool Game additive, storyline in my opinion is amazing but animation is slow,and gameplay slowly start to get boring"
Favourite game
I'm literally getting shafted
Sweet!
This is a good app.
This game would be better if there was an auto battle or skip option. If you dont have hours and hours to spare grinding then this game isn't for you. The summoning rates also suck.
Not working again for wifi :/. It's saying that it can't connect to server even though my connection is fast. Not the only one having this problem. Hope this gets fixed soon because i really like the game
"False advertising! Downloaded because of an add saying I can play as raikou but I didn't know I'd have to purchase her to play. Went in expecting something fun but was met with an annoying pay to play wall. If you're like me and thinking about playing the game because of the couple characters that you like, just save yourselves the trouble and go somewhere else."
Astolfo is best girl
"The game is really fun, and the story is really good, but the rates on banners are absolutely horrendous, and the game has optimization issues that cause it to freeze a lot."
Perfect but some stuff could be fix like the transfer account link just hook it to are google email
"cursed gacha hell taught me to appreciate SQ more, and pray more because luck did not come easily unless EX luck but story and waifus all are amazing design and good plot."
"Great game especially if your waifu is from fate franchise! Yes the gacha rate is bad but it's not like you have to pay to advance in the game as many of the lower rarity servants are good and strong. Don't be one of those who whine that the game is too hard without 5 stars when people can and have actually do all the quest until now with lower rarity servants only. You just need to be smart with your team. The game needs time and patience to get the most out of it, months until ready. Glhf!"
"Amazing gacha game. But you have to know two things going in. 1) The gacha is -brutal- if youre going for rare characters, but most characters are usable in all content with enough elbow grease with but a few exceptions. 2) The game's story is very VERY boring early on and doesnt really get good until the America singularity. This is enough to understandably turn some people away. If you can get past this, FGO is one of the best gacha games on the market."
Horrible customer service department. They are unwilling to help. The roll rate is so low and just a cash grab. Steer clear and if you dont hope you dont run into any issues or mistakes because they surely would not try and resolve the issues. I have been playing for years and spent money ont his game yet they do not seem to care at all about your experience.
The game itself is great...collecting servants and a great storyline( although I skip some of its part *alright most of its part*) It is one of the games that no need to pay to have a great time.
This good i like the animation
If you like the fate frachise play this
Fun on the bun
great gameplay amazing characters but recomend the new players to watch the series
"Trash Support. I played for roughly a year and got a new phone only to realize that they had no link system. And when I tried to get my old account back through their ""support"" no one had enough care to actually try. Until my account is returned this stays 1 star and i reccomend NO ONE play this game"
So far it's a really good game. Takes a bit to learn all the different areas and functions bit there is a help menu. Game play is really good and the graphics are too.
Loading has improved by alot compared to last time. Super addictive game with onslaught of events but the gacha can sometimes leave u demoralized.. but altogether very good game if u r into fate lore
"Very fun, but difficult for early players to do events."
"Rate up is a lie, that is all"
I love this game so much. It's hard sometimes but I enjoy a challenge lol.
"Although i waited a long time for a response, support helped effectively resolve the issue."
Good Gatcha Game.. it Just Freezes In My Phone Sometimes.. eh
"sweep dungeon please, too tired from grinding"
Game wont open if your phone is in usb debugging mode! Finally tried it and it's ok. Now the game... it reminds me of cornflakes... the veterans (like my dad) might like it but I think it's too plain and boring for me
"Gives minimal currency, rates are unfair not even a pitty system, u are forced to use a supporter at all times, no auto or skip features and no voiced dialog... anywhere."
"Details are difficult, it's good game, good mechanics, good art, good voice acting"
This game is life ...... That is all
Love this game. the fact that you can even use your favorite characters even if you don't have them you can still use them an amazing feature the game has
"An older gacha game for sure, but the mechanics are solid, you can do endgame with F2P units and the writing, OST, and story are awesome!"
"First off, love the game and the series. One of those, simple to learn, difficult to master kind of deals, complete with the love-hate relationship that is gacha. But, there is something that has happened to this game that's upsetting. Been playing for a year now, and the issue has repeatedly tempted me to uninstall, and that's performance issues. The system upgrade patches throughout the year have made the game run progressively worse on my tablet. I hope it can be remedied."
This is hell you're walking into. But this is the gatcha hell I love... The amount of husbando I get is üëå you can even brag F2P BTW.
the gacha is cruel but the waifu is worth it
it feels great to get those 4-5 star heroes. But that 0.01% bites. great game but lottery sucks.
I almost had to remortgage my home to keep playing the gacha and never got my waifu... 10/10 would put myself in debt again
0.7 percent drop rate lmao
"Incredible story, lovable characters, and amazing character designs. The gameplay is simple on a surface level but can get a lot more difficult the more you get to know the game. Gacha is complete hell but that is what makes the experience of getting an SSR more valuable than any other gacha games out there. Definitely should have some fate knowledge to get a good grasp of what this game really is."
Loving it! üòÅ
Astolfo best boy and atalanta is underrated
"Very good game, highly enjoyable gameplay and good characters, and can be done ftp. The gacha has some problems tho, and some designs are meh, but overall i love it"
"Best Game Ever , thanks for my friends that recommend this game it's so addicting when i first played this nearly a month could'nt be more better!"
"Been playing for almost two years and still going strong. The story is entertaining and the characters and graphics are amazing! As with all gacha games, I wish higher rarities were easier to obtain, but with this game, lower rarities are just as viable as higher ones."
The game is like a drugü§£
I rolled Saber.
"I just started almost a week ago, and I'm already lvl 100. This game is fun."
"The game is absolutely wonderful. My only critique is that it takes a very long time to gather the required material for Ascension. Aside from that, I highly recommend this game to others."
This is amazing this is my favorite anime
Extremely fun I would suggest anyone to try this game has the best servants always adds new experiences
"If you love Fate franchise this is a Go to Game for you. No rush on progress. No auto play(Well we could use one for auto grinding), but for the most part best gacha game i played. It is hard to get your waifu though."
"I would give this five stars, but the gacha aspect of this is heavily weighted towards making you pay by inflating the pulls with craft essences. These, while helpful and necessary(only for a select few CE), exist mostly to prevent you from getting more higher level servants. The gameplay is fun, the characters are great as well as the animations, but the gacha aspect feels unfair a lot of the time compared to similar games."
Everything's good!
"Been playing since release and feel like leaving a review. Have been enjoying the game. Pretty much get every character I want when I save for them, got pretty much one 5 star for every class. UMU~ nero is best btw second is tomoe, tomoe needs more love gamer oni lovers rise up lol. A fun turnbase game with pretty good animations then pretty much every anime fan will most likely play once in thier life"
"FGO received an optimization update that made the game run 100% better. No longer am I spending more time waiting for quests to load than actually playing. The roster is nice, servants of all rarities are useful. The rates are still as trash as always. I have seen banners destroy ppl mentally for not getting anything after so much spent so buyer beware. Outside of that there's always some sort of even running to grind out. No pvp which is a plus in my book for balance."
Patience is key and stop rolling for every banner in the game (unless you whale).
Indeec this is a good game but quarts is so hard to obtain :(
gets boring after a while and doing the same thing over and over again kinda sucks
I've never let it go and no time will let it go because its the best fantastic game that you can have üôÇ
As far as gotcha games go this one isn't the kindest to ist F2P players but if your relationship with RNGsus is strong you will get the sweet sweet waifu or husbando that you are pulling for! All your favorite servants are here!!!
"Its a gacha mobile game. I like Fate/ and heroine x alters pretty fun so its a good one. Still no astolfo :[ (Gems are a bit pricy if your a payer, but you get a good amount of free gems so just dont buy em)"
Andre 3+00
Its fate
"Who came up with the idea of trading in EXP cards for mana prisms? Such a pointless tactic makes no sense, as not being able to level up a favorite Servant (3*, 4* or 5*) would basically eliminate the point of having a team that is strong enough to take down Saber Alter, Hercules, or even Archer Emiya. Fix this. Please. I'm not going to keep tackling insanely strong bosses with a lvl 30, 40 or 60 Servant for very long..."
I Love It!
I like Fate and gacha is addicting
Fate fan. Great game.
Kawaii waifus
I just wish they add an auto function to not constantly keep playing and implement a system that allows us to do multiple runs at once like some others games. And increase the rates of getting a 5 star form 1% to 3% so players could have an easier time pulling for the character they want.
It's a good game with lots to collect the odds of 5 servents maybe low but rarity ain't everything a good team with the right abillitys and class can overcome many of the tougher enamys
Problem solved and as usual the games fantastic!
story is very good
"Game is really fun, yes it is a grind to get the heroes you want but the story is really good and makes up for it"
"Pretty good way to pass the time, wish it was easier to gather upgrade materials and get new servants"
its been loads of fun to play
Can't get hidden objects game!!
I almost played it for 2 years
cured my cancer astolfo best girl
I love the game so much. I might be addicted to it.
"Apart from the 5* rates, I can only say... Umu! Yo wa tanoshii! This game is a quality VN disguised as a mobile gacha game. Apart from the first few singularities, the story picks up near the end of the first part and never lets up. The rates, as I mentioned, are undeniably atrocious. But it makes up for it by providing you ways to strengthen lower rarity servants as well as genuinely great free welfare 4* servants that can carry you just fine even all the way to the current endpoint."
The only mobile game I can play forever
"Fun game, loads to do yea you need to pay to get what you want pronto but this is very much a free to play game aswell you can get what you want with hardwork and patience"
Im speechless
Is fun and has great art. But kinda grindy so i wish there was an autoplay.
Love the characters.
I'm huge fan of the fate series
mm yea yea astolfo = god
Lost my college fund.
"Fate/Grand Order has been the one mobile game I've become attached to. As a huge Fate fan, the game offers near endless content and great progression. I haven't spent a single dollar and have still been able to enjoy the game and progress with high-level servants. Give it a go! It's not a pay-to-win."
No response. Just a top tier game
"hard to snatch SSRs, but otherwise a really good game with a nice story. (Unless you whale. Then this game might be a nightmare for you)"
"Rates could be a little more forgiving, but after 3 years I guess I'm used to it."
Muy bueno
Wonderful experience playing this game as a major fan of the series
"The Gacha is rigged but if you are reading this you have already have FGO downloaded and know this. The story is awesome and some of the Heroic Spirits I would die for so..... Good game, Gacha sucks."
"Rates are ass but it is what it is. Also, story is nice"
F2P friendly. An amazing story good music and hella waifus. Best girl Asterios
The game is amazing with the characters and the story line is great and easy to follow through
Still Rate up is a Lie
The game play is great. Gatcha not so much but still lucky sometimes. Too many events back to back but there is great rewards. The lore is fascinating... Love it! Please put Ned Kelly in as a Australian servant please it would be great to have a servant from all continents. Australia is still missing. Anyway furthest I have gotten ever is London part... Jack the Ripper is a hard part to pass due to my mismanagement Anyway starting over again to stop it being boring. Best of luck to Aniplex/TM.
"Amazing game, there are multiple features about it that just keeps me playing."
Really fun. Nice that many 3* and free characters are extremely viable so you don't need to whale to succeed at the game.
"This game is just so much fun. As a new fan to the Fate series, this just brings me so much joy. And as a history and mythology nerd, I enjoy seeing historical and mythological characters revamped into such amazing designs!"
Good game believe me
10/10 best game ever!!11!!!!!!1!!!1!!
I freaking love this game the only complaints I have with the game so far is that it's too hard to get those special Wheels to summon a selected servant cuz you have to get fired of the same servant in order to get just one and it takes like 10 of these special Wheels to get one and sometimes it seems like the game updates like a few time a week. gets kind of annoying having to keep updating the game in order to play I understand for events and everything and want to hear English voices in game.
"If you like the fate series on any level, there is something for you here."
atleast give me 5 stars
ohhhohhoohhohoho hot husbando
"I lost everything, but at least I have Liz."
Its good.
"Pretty fun game just has too much grinding. But if you like grinding and don't mind the 1% five star rate you will probably like this game, especially if you're a fan of the fate series."
Love the story and gameplay.
At the okeonos /okeanos level there is a lot of lag and crash but the other level is good üòÄüòÄüòÄ
"good game, nice rate drop"
"For a gacha game its very engaging , the mechanics are also suprisingly deep."
horrible summon rates
Murumasa when Murumasa when Murumasa when Murumasa whenMurumasa when
Good luck....
"I've been playing this game almost 3 years I think? And it's been a great experience. The storytelling is phenomenal, the graphics and animation are well done. And watching this game grow has been amazing! I had already watched some of the Fate anime, but this game made me look more into the series as a whole. The gacha can definitely sap your pockets (don't give into a certain waifu!) but no regrets for the most part"
OHH YEAH
Very good game .
Grind hell most times but fun for masochist
The story is 11/10
This is probably one of the best game with good storylines
FGO is worth playing for the story and has enjoyable gameplay mechanics. It gets a bad rep because gacha but honestly it is very forgiving in how readily it gives out SQ and summon tickets for free as well as welfare servants. I absolutely love FGO as a diehard Fate fan. Just don't sink thousands on non-GSSR banners and you'll be fine
"Addicted and I hate it. Honestly though fun stories, exciting gacha and characters to suit anyone's style"
An Excellent one
Fgo is having a Problem again where I somehow cannot connect to the server and its really irritating because I have Reinstalled the game 3 times and I have been trying to make it work for the last 5 hours Other than some few errors which cannot be dealt with in a blink of an eye the game is Fun and the story is also good both main and event stories.
"Grand Order is the compilation story about heroes from various era and places. Be it good or evil ones, this is the story where they come together in order to prevent incineration of humanity. While the gacha rate is bad, even lower rarity and free Servants can be as strong as SSR ones if you max (and Grail) them. The power balance is certainly maintained, almost no Servants are too strong or too weak. It's all about how you use them. You will enjoy this game as long as you are not too greedy."
"Gacha rates are miserable, the developer is stingy, app can be laggy at spots so why so high? Game is designed such that there are many totally valid approaches while even ""outdated"" servants and ces have their place. Even the low rarity ones can potentially have special tricks that higher rarities can't reproduce with better numbers. Story starts of questionable but gets much better starting in Camelot."
Good luck
"I love this game. The story, the soundtrack, the gameplay is all worth the grind. The grind however, is the 99% of the game, so would not recommend to people who don't like grinding or have other more important things to do aside from sitting all day at home tapping buttons on your phone. Aside from that 10/10 best game I've ever played."
I'd rate higher if I got what I wanted most of the time. Lol
"This game has 2 sides like no In between Its either Heaven or Hell, and i love both sides"
"Love the game, nice story. But i hate the drop rate. Rate up never treat me well"
"Lost my account months ago, and tried to contact customer service but sadly didn't get my account back because I forgotten my ID. I miss my Ishtar..."
Cho 5 sao de dc 5 sao
"It's suffering, but it's suffering that I choose to walk into of my own accord."
Pay 2 Waifu and a grind fest
Enjoying the game a lot. I'm pretty new to fate but enjoy the story and events. Gameplay was easy for me to figure out.
gacha hell is gacha life
The only mobile game I actually enjoy playing and don't get bored of
I kinda like the game. However I uninstalled it once and reinstalled at a later date and all the heroes I had are now gone.
"One of the best f2p gachas tbh, it's got a great story line and very unique when I compare this to the other fate games; where the MC competes with other master-servant pairs. This one doesn't pit you against anyone, sure you'd go up against servants just like in the other fate games, but here you're also against Solomon's demons (read: which btw really exists) and not only that you could team up with the servants tied to the singularity or lost belt episode you're in."
Minus one star because gacha is bad civilization.
Super nice story would love to see other fate games made by this company
Please increase chance to get ssr
"It's an amazingly fun game. Unfortunately, it still has a few loading problem. In that it does have a bit of trouble of loading the attacks sometimes and then freezes but that can possibly just be my phone. On the good side of things the story about is fun and sad and all things in between so I definitely recommend it."
Collect your PNG waifus now!! All with crippling debt.
I am doing the gacha with 120 sq and why could i still not get any 5 star servant its always CE
I love jalter
Good game continue the good work
"At first I said this game relies on spending and only pay to play people get what they want, but I have been very lucky this year and I've gotten the units I want. This game is fun, with a great story, amazing voice acting, and great characters."
"Great game, loved the story but the summons are bad and I feel like I get ripped off when I use all my sq on something that is suppose to be double chance in summon, still gameplay is good"
"After the last update, I got a bug: the screen keep freezing every time the globe map start to rotate, so I can't do anything."
"Fun, funny, and exciting. The events are creative and awesome. I dont ever feel like it's too difficult. The mechanics of characters are easy to understand and strategizing your team can actually be really fun. Put the time in and this game is awesome."
Rate up is a lie :)
best gacha game ever
"some old servants need some buff, new meta keeps old players engaged not by introducing new servants but changing some old redundant ones, like the drop rate is horrible, team building is hard enough for F2P, you need jesus to pull good servants if youre not a whale"
Can't Update always error
New update makes the loading times so much better! Though it tends to freeze up sometimes...
Thank you
"If you're a fan of the Fate series, this game is a must play. The story creates a massive lore which would take you on a fun ride. Although this game can be repetitive, tedious, and sometimes gives unforgiving gacha rolls, it still picks up as one of the best rpg games I've ever played."
umu
The game is great. Concidering the fact that i will actually have to invest time into this game is my only concern. I am quite lazy but I am confident that i will be carried.
Most fun I've had with mobile gaming
"I'll change my rating if the issue is solved. I have been playing for almost a month and whenever the event is coming to an end the game just keeps lagging and crashing. There has been no updates of maintinance and whatnot but it really is displeasuring to play a game that is supposed to be at 11 million downloads to have this kind of issue. I mean seriously, it's annoying. My data connection is great and I can even steam HD YT videos with ease but with this game, Ugh! Please fix the issue."
Very farming based as well as gacha based. But hey you get what you signed up for.
Everything's awesome for realz.
"The drop rates are meme worthy low. But, it can still be fun"
Fun game love the franchise it's based on
Anastasia = best spirit
Unique game experience
Fyre
Waifus.
"Please for developed this game, can you add this game to indonesian region"
escape while you still can its too addictive
"This is a rip off of about 30 other games. Slow excessive dialog, painfully bland combat, and the sheer cost to spend is ridiculous. This game should have been more hack and slash or at least less slow paced jrpg. Being this coming from the fate anime series i expected more and better and tbh using the noble phantasm for and character is a total, total disappointment. Skip this and make them do it right"
Great Game....
Utterly amazing
I'll Walk in to the Hell a second time
great game but rates
"a mobile game with a fantastic story writing and amazing soundtrack. if you play only for the gameplay, you'll probably will get bored real fast, also this game is one of the worst gacha rate below 1% for ssr, not the worst but one of them."
They should add a way to merge accounts
"Great anime series, game is definitely a wallet gouger. Save your money as the drop rates are extremely horrible. 30 tickets and 90 SQ and not a single banner drop. Fire Emblem Heroes is much better, more to do and no lopsided battles or special attack spammage etc. 2 stars because of the anime otherwise it would be zero stars."
Went to redownload this game and now it won't work very sad use to love this game
Sometimes will corrupt data and have you download files again
Awesomeness and addicting
Good but the drop rates trash
"EXCUSE ME, will you run a maintenance about the game, sometimes it eats a lot of network data or Mobile Data, even in my wifi, the game internet usage eats a lot due to the update you made yesterday.. I have been experiencing such High Internet Usage while just playing this game for only less than 40minutes.. with this I might consider quiting the game.. please fix it, it's a great game I did enjoy my game.. my.time.i waste for the game is totally worth it but somehow the game use a lot of net."
Good but VERY p2w
"Game is actually good, all gacha games are grindy - that's nothing new. Rates are so-so. The gameplay and storyline are constantly improving in terms of writing, especially on the new events and main story. You'll love some of your servants based from their interaction and interludes. The support system are also really responsive when you lose your account, I accidentally lost mine and got it restored under 3 days. I'm really thankful for that!"
This game's story one of the best or the best story ive seen in a mobile game.The gacha rates are pretty low but it is what it is.This game got me into the anime and i love it.The battle system is easy to learn and is addicting to make you play the game more.The Noble Phantasm animations are also top tier. One of the best gachas i have ever played 10/10.
Wow! unbelievable! this game won't give u anything for downloading and playing the game for the first time... other gacha games will give u free currency to summon on their banners but this game won't give u anything .. really bad for new players I really cant believe it... no gifts nothing... dont even bother until they fix it
Fun at first and as you progress in the game but later you soon realize that your never gonna summon a 4 star or higher SR .
Nice game and still need to fix some server connection problems
It was somewhat interesting. The amount of chances of getting a 5 star servant is slim. The fact that some of em are somewhat overpowering to other servants.
"The garbage rates fuel my gambling addiction and I've lost track of time, my soul has left my body and my body has become an unlimited gacha whale. And I've lost my family. Overall it's a fun game, perfect for the family, even more for a gambler 5 stars"
I got too many salts
"Best played on an emulator like BlueStacks, otherwise you'll lag out like no tommorow. On a standard phone, it's a 3-star due to the lag, but once it's on stronger hardware like BlueStacks it runs fine and is 4-star instead."
Good anime game for Fate fans
"gatcha game, kinda fun but the game is very slow. 10+ minutes to do a turn based game?"
"The best story out of any game I have ever played, can be played for free by using only low rarity servants. The gacha rates are horrendous though at 0.5% for a 5 star ssr. Takes around 1000 to 1500 saint quartz to get 1 5 star."
Gilgamesh x Ritsuka !!!!
grindy but good but still grindy
Not to far in but fun
"Free to play is good, waifus are the best."
Good game I enjoy it a lot
"You don't run into many gacha games with stories and characters you actually care about like this one. The gameplay is simple and straightforward, yet it's still fun. Even just grinding for embers can be fun. It's a very addictive game with lots of personality."
Picked up the game again. Good game.
Just wish the screen size can support bigger phones
"I love this game, however Im wondering if any other android users are having issues with the connection? It says cant connect to server???"
Updated I had to uninstall the game. Hope I don't lose all the work I have done. Because it wouldn't work.
"Great gameplay, easy to learn mechanics with some degree of tactics to be learned. Frequent seasonal events to spice up the otherwise stellar story (that also gets updated every so often), that also get repeated for those who miss them the first time. Good luck catching them all, the roll rate for the best servants is....low. I pray for your willpower and checking account."
Great game. Played it a few times. But now I'm having trouble. I've restarted it about 15 times now to get a new main character but all it gives me is a berserker. Thats fine for the beginning but not later on. Any tips help.
"They did some update recently and the game lags like crazy, takes 30 minutes for 1 animation to complete and repeatedly crashs, I reported this so many times but these guys haven't done anything about it, a shameless cash grab the only good thing is the story and the cast of characters"
"The story's not hooky, the characters are okay, but when I tell the game that I can read/speak English, the characters speak Japanese in battle, with no subtitles. Other than that, they don't speak at all, and you just read the words they say. Also, so far, there's lots of strong women. Are there any good men in the game? Geez! Also, it gets VERY laggy, and sometimes the game doesn't respond when I tap. I'm sorry, but I'm uninstalling."
Nice herc best servant
your Gacha EX luck will arrive! so just believe that their is HOPE!
"Easy, simple, and deppresing game in a positive way"
FGO get ur waifus
Best Waifu in the game and also best story for a gacha game but worst rate up ever
"Great gameplay, superb storyline, interesting events and lots of gacha waifus. There is no pvp on this game which makes it F2P friendly. Every characters/servants have their unique set of skills which makes even the low level servants very useful! However, this game has one of the worst gacha system, mixing of characters and non characters scouts into one gacha system while having super low scout rates of high level servants. This game is also super grindy; be it leveling or farming items."
I simply live with the pain.
Best rate ups ever
"I like the game, it's so fun!"
"Love it, all my favorite servants back for more as i grind through hell. definitely not for everyone, im already lost and hooked so i can't get out, but if you like fate you'll more than likely love this if you don't not so much."
"Great story but overall usability, value for money and game modes need improvement"
gameplay wise: epic gacha wise: still epic but its gonna give u a lot of salt
"Wonderful game overall. The animations are clean, especially considering the volume of characters (with more being added almost monthly), the strategy and story is all there. But unless you've got a bunch of time to kill grinding for leveling and ascension, I wouldn't recommend it. Plus, I'm legally required to mention that the gacha rate is horrendous. Don't bother going for the SSRs (5 stars) unless your wallet is feeling too full. Not worth it 99% of the time"
It cool
"The story is very meh, its not very free to play friendly, and it takes FOREVER to get enough of the premium currency to actually sommun for more units. Even when you do have enough you're more than likely not gonna get anything good because the chances of getting higher rarity characters are slim to none."
YOU ONLY CAME FOR WAIFUS DON'T LIE TO ME
"Good story, gacha is hell"
It's cool and nice it's like playing final fantasy
"Well, it's a good game my only problem is your gacha systme plus the freaking quartz. It's too expensive like the cheapest can't even let you roll 10x. Also, rate up is a lie. Japan server's rate up is actually ok than NA."
"Dont get too cocky just because i rate you five stars, Mongrel. Consider this acknowledgement from the King of Heroes"
Rates are trash that's why it makes so much money.
"All my friends play this game but I can't get into it. The animation is clunky and the combat is confusing. I'm gonna keep trying, but personally I don't see the appeal."
T·ªâ l·ªá quay ra 5 sao qu√° th·∫•p
I want new update connect account to google so it's much more easier to save account without remember the transfer id
doujinshi without context? bullcr*p
great game but need to make it easier to get servants above level 3
"with the amount of good content this game has, you cant believe that this is free"
"Probably the best in terms of depth, development and the amount of content gacha out there. Also, unlike many other games in a similar genre, 2, 3 and 4 star servants are actually playable and can carry you through any event or story stage. The only reason you NEED to roll for a 5 star servant is either them being game-breaking (only a couple of servants are like that) or waifu reasons. So yeah, gacha is not that bad and you get a ton of summoning currency from the story."
"This Game ia Top Notch for Fate Freaks out there, 5 star over all, but all i can ask Is that Make Noble Phantasm scenes more dramatic,, So is the Fight scene. thats all THANK YOU FOR THE BEST GAME, YOU all Created.."
I like it.
I LOVE IT SO SO MUCHH
still no auto even after these years
It is good
Great app and great anime. Would recommend playing this
"If you want a game that is entertaining with a great story that exists in the fate universe this is it. The game has a full thoughtout story and great game mechanics. The gatcha is rng, so anything can and will happen depending on your luck. some of my friends have ""EX' luck and get 5 stars like candy and others...not so much. It's totally free to play, you can beat the game without spending a dime and have fun while doing it. Save for what you want,the game gives plenty of quartz if you play."
DAJAKU DAJAKU !!
This is the first game where i gave 5 stars the story is so amazing ive been playing this for 3 months now even if im halfway the story i has the best story ever
Fun to see your fate heros and heroines and learn about new ones. Mildly irritating trying to get one of them you like without dumping exorbitant amounts of real cash into them.
"If you're a Fate series fan, then you'll really like this!"
Good to pass the time
u w u) im not upset now. I can play the game now
"Sometimes the text is too much, but otherwise the gameplay, graphics and sound are superb."
Nothing but grind and terrible drop rates on units and materials
Its a good time sink
SKADI?!
Amazingü§©
it's okay
"Umu umu~ Enjoy the salt, anyways."
Good game but I'm not willing to put much if any money into the game if 95 percent of the time I'm just getting CE for the 30 spin instead of at least 1 new servant I even had one were there was just the 1 guaranteed 4 star CE and the rest was 3 star CE and a single silver servant please fix this and yes it was during a banner when odds are supposed to be up on 4 star and above servants
My favotite most played game!
I've been playing this game since cualter originally dropped and I've loved the game ever since but a complaint I've always had was the summon rates and the excessive farming they need to add some type of way to farm faster like Bleach Brave souls or Grand Cross
I love danganronpa
"Good game, updates very often"
Rich story
"Incredibly unfun game, where gameplay revolves around repeatedly grinding materials forever. But, the story and characters are some of the most interesting you'll see in the platform. Played since launch and I hope to see the story to its completion."
"So far everything's pretty awesome, I haven't run into any problems and the gameplay and the art are just superb"
A very awesome and fun time passer. I love that I can have a team of my favorite Fate charaters.
Love the game splended work on it although I do wish drop rates were higher.
SUPER ADDICTIVE AND FUN
pretty fun and a great time killer though since it's a gacha based game bad luck can be quite rough and if you're a f2p even worse. And if both like your's truly it is actual hell if hell was fun. Update: It's not fun I have no idea why I still play it after all this time. Probably because of Antonio.
I can't update.....
Please take my money. I need more waifu.jpg
"I came because I was a fan of the series, i stayed for the story."
A bit grindy and the rate are pretty low but overall it's a beautiful game and wonderful experience.
Full marks for S A L T
Game play can be a little to a lot grindy at times but the story and characters more than make up for that. More male servants pls XD
"i lost hours of my life to this game, 10/10 would recommend"
Honestly its just a fun game the only thing ill say is try not to spend money
Love this game but plz available in my country Malaysia!
"The game is a bit slow due to the card system compared to other gacha rpg games, but it is good. The gacha rng isn't bad. You just have to be smart when you roll so that you do not waste the quartz."
"Gacha sucks, everything else is top tier"
"Good but character draws suck, you get the same person 12 times in a row."
"It has a great story and the gameplay is fun. The gacha rates are low, but you can do really well in the with just the low rarity servants. High rarity servants are really good but they are not necessarily for any part of the story, unlike for other gacha games that make it impossible to play without high rarity characters. The only bad thing is that the game is kind of a grindy mess, but the story makes up for it."
Fate grand order is great story with memorable characters! Only thing that everyone needs to be warned about is the gacha....
"Gameplay is easy to understand with subtle mechanics that you can learn to get better. The story is especially enjoyable, with tons of fun characters. The gacha is pretty unforgiving, but totally optional in terms of gameplay."
It's the greatest game that i play ever you should totally download it for real guys
"Fun, gatcha is addictive."
Perfect. I Love this game.
"Awesome, this is my favorite game."
"Fate/Grand Order is an excellent addition to the Fate series and welcomes newcomers. It's storyline is captivating, and it's battle system is simple yet unique. The game's story is absolutely beautiful, and the experience is unparalleled. F/GO's art is beautiful; whether it's the characters or the CGs. The servant system is extremely rewarding. When leveling up servants, the player has to work hard in order to make their servants stronger. Overall, Fate/Grand Order is an astonishing experience."
"Lovin it, even tho i succ at it Edit: i still succ at it"
Please help. It consumes me.
I really like this games. Dant√©s is my favorite character and I'll definitely be trying to get him
Been playing since 2017 still entertaining and fun
Good job on making the game better and better
"I absolutely love this game!! I've been playing it for about 4 years now and I haven't lost interest once, this is the game I always go to when I'm feeling sad."
"If you want a turn based RPG with fate characters, you've come to the right place. The joke is ""Fate/grind order"" and, having played this game for a while, I can say for certain that it does hold some truth. However, DW has been really good as of late to implement UI and quality of life updates from JP early into NA, as well as getting animation updates out in a expedited manner. I would recommend this game to any person who enjoys the fate series. Just be sure to save for people you like."
I absolutely love this game the only thing I wish was changed is the SSR servant drop rate so getting limited servants were easier but other than that I love it good stories and game play in my opinion
"Fate Grind Order Forever. If you want gacha hell then welcome. But fgo players are masochists, so we enjoy the salt"
I just love fate series
I am enjoying it so much ‚ù§
Best Gacha game out their all servants are useful best story hands down and it just keeps getting better with all the updates.
more 5 star pls :((
Too rng personally. However better than other turn base gameplay alternatives like star wars. But great to play.
"Fun game, lot of story"
"Its the best game! Made me understand fate series and also have alot of stuff to enjoy.. and you can also Feel the suffering damn! Its great!!! Like saving over half a year for a one servant and the day comes and you roll for it, you didnt get her/him damn its hurt!! Like hell my heart brooke"
Its quite good..the story is great and i like the characters
The app run super slow on.my phone
Will test your self control
The only bad thing is that rate up is a lie
Having a blast
The service is now top notch and even though I am F2P and suffers in gacha hell. I am glad
Its a great game i really like. And i like how i never get the characters i really want
"By far, one of the best in the genre."
waifus everywhere
gay
You will miss 4% of your life if you dont play this game
Great game 650 quartz no ssr
"While the rates are atrocious and the gameplay repititive, FGO has characters that make me feel invested and story that has actual effort, even after all these years playing I still love this game(even though I get salty at times) And they actualy strive to make the game better, with the recent engine update as proof"
Add event for april mop please like jpn server do
I don't enjoy this game but I'm too balls deep to quit 10/10 game
Best waifu sim out there
Fate series fans will love this game.. massive storyline and f2p friendly too
Best pay 2 waifu turn based rpg its f2p friendly bois
Make this game worldwide already
"So, I am ready to trade my soul for saber faces"
Go big or Go home
Beatiful and great game üòÄ
"Great game. Good story, music and voice acting. Can be grindy but it is enjoyable."
If you are fate anime fans. You can't miss this game.
Gacha membunuh uang ku
The game is Great and fun you should definitely give this game a try and the girls are sexy
nice story and worth it. Its just the gacha though but its fine
How do you make a farming fest with a gacha system with garbage rates fun? I don't know either but this is pretty good.
Waifuyyuuuuus
addicting gacha game that is loyal to the fate stay night universe
"I've only been playing for about a couple of months and I've invested about 300 hours of gameplay and I'm very satisfied. As a new player, yes, the gacha is a (b)itch and farming is incredibly hard, it takes a lot of AP and patience, however, the satisfaction and enjoyment I've taken out of it is worth a lot. The story is compelling, moving and witty. I'm in love with the characters. The staff support are accomodating as well. Overall, I really love this game. Kudos!"
Best mobile visual novel
Awesome üëç
The story is good
The games alright and there's alot of characters to get so Fate fans will get what they want. BUT after the recent update the game kept freezing and glitching up on my phone.
Love this game üíó
"I need skadi banner, Chat, and PvP system"
BEST GAME EVER.
"I very much enjoy this game but, I wish you could link your data because losing all you worked for sucks"
"Its a good game, enjoyed seeing my favourite characters from the fate series. But, by God, the gacha made me die inside everytime."
"A treat for Type-Moon fans. The gameplay isn't complicated, it's the story that draws people in. Also prepare to gamble a lot if you're planning to get into this game."
Great addicting game!
This game has rekindled my interests in fate franchise.
This is very popular
Lovely customer support great mechanics lovely character designs wonderful voice acting great compelling intriguing and entertaining story wish they had a way to save your profile than issuing a transfer number though
"It's a good game, but I don't recommend it to purely ""free-2-play"" players. The Gacha is a meme for being one storm to a giant salt wave. All in all, it's a fun game. [okay, I did the thing. NOW GIVE ME A BETTER GACHA RATE!]"
I played this game since it's release (It's changed my life while playing this game)(it's a part of my life now)
this went from fate grand order to fate lostbelt
Olive sent me
Okay game üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜ
"Great long story, it's confusing at 1st but very rewarding once you get the hang of it. It's hell but we all know what we're walking into."
"This Is the best anime turn based rpg on android that ever got released, the story is 4.8/5, the soundtrack is 4.9/5, the character animation is 4.5/5, the gacha rate is not so good. Once again i dare to say this is the best anime turn based rpg game on android. If i can imma give this a 10 star"
"Great story and learned some history from it in a fun interesting way, even if some of it was inaccurate, I could always look at it again. My only complaints is it takes a bit too long to load and I understand some people have trouble with the gacha, but my luck is pretty okay so I dont have a problem with that and try not to let it take away."
"Aniplex supports scamming people, do not support them or their games. Insentivising people into spending money when they plan to shut down the game regardless"
"I am pretty sure no other gacha does what FGO does for its daily/consecutive log ins, and it sucks"
"The game has good quality but my gosh is the drop rate bad, sometimes your swimming in 5 and 4 stars, other times your crying in a corner knowing you spent 400 bucks on nothing. Lower then 1% is pretty greedy so play at your own risk."
Give more free sq and i'll give it a 5star
The game is enjoyable just a grind if you don't use real money though it's fun to play the Summoning pull rates are Disappointing
Dark Souls
Very greedy Gacha system you could spend thousands of dollars and not get any SR compared to magia record you just need to summon 100times to get a sure 5*
Dawg its fate of course its good
After 3 days of playing I can't play anymore it just always say that I don't have internet connection even though I have and it cant connect itself to the network. I've already reinstalled this game numerous times and I'd still like to be able to play it someday but it seems as though it doesn't want me to.
"Great story from the 6th singularity onwards. Gameplay is just a side dish, play it like you would a vn"
Super free to play friendly!
Game sucks üòÖüò≠üòî would not recommend. Because graphics anime and complicated
"Aniplex doesn't respect its NA servers. As a Magia Record player, they are disrespectful and basically storybook villains, squeezing fans for every last dollar that they can. I will literally never consume anything Aniplex again."
"100 days in. Still enjoy it. Easy to learn gameplay. Summon rates are low but it works for the game. Edit: Eventually this game up after completing the first chapter. The last couple zones were brutally difficult and I was going days without even trying the story due to how difficult it was. It became a grind fest, either during events or just to farm up enhancement materials. I stopped having fun and ended up uninstalling."
"I've been having some issues eith the game. It says ""Failure to connect to game server"" but I have a good and stable internet connection. I tried restarting the app numerous times, but it's still not working. I can't exactly reinstall the app because I don't have an issue transfer number. Please help me with this."
300usd for 2jpeg
"I love this game so much. I love the animation and the story. The only problem... Is the rate up... But nevertheless, I love this game!"
"I'm happy with everything except the fact the data is Saved on the phone and not an account. I've lost like 4 accounts that way. Not that I'm complaining because 2 of those were my fault, but it would be nice to have saved data on the go in case my phone breaks."
The app is always getting stuck on a black loading screen and I'm having to uninstall and reinstall I have enough data and I constantly clear the cache it's kinda annoying but not the worst thing in the world the game is fun tho
Vasavi Shakti
Gacha rate is so low
"This is not PAY-TO-WIN GAME, its PAY-TO-WAIFU GAME!!.thats why i gave 5 stars."
Its good to play
Kek 22 SSR pulls still a f2p. Get on my level
Love the fate series. Love this game. The story gets alot better later. The characters are interesting and its nice seeing them move. I wish there was more info on the characters for how moves and skills would work or why they are a servant in that class. I guess that's just flavor text but I also feel like thats really important in a game about more than 100 characters coming to help you.
The game was nice but please give us a function to connect our FGO account to our email FFS! Writing the code and saving it is stressful!
I wish it is more convinient if we can bind it to e-mail address so it will be easy to log in ang log out with multiple account.
Repetitive
I lost my account
Hope and get SSRs from an f2p
Its bruhh
Cant load after latest update
Like the game and the story hate the terrible rates. I have summoned over 10 10x pulls and havent gotten a single 5*. In addition i have done 30+ pulls on the tickets to get my one and only 5*
"This is amazing game, love it!,The reason I started playing it cause Emiya was able to construct that beautiful Rho Ais Shield but I was wondering when you guys are gonna put Emiya in as a extra class since he said himself he not a Heroic spirit he's a Guardian. I'm hopeing he comes in an a Extra servant Class, something like a defender like mash so heil be Able to use The Rho Ais Shield we saw.It looks like tiamat sheild so that's why I said extra class. Ty an hope he has his white scarf n cape"
It hard for f2p but it a good gamr
This game has stolen everything from me
good game because this is trash game
Delicious waifus
Fgo
It is a very fun and addicting game.
"Always read the story, don't skip it ruins the experience, as an f2p player it's rly tough on getting the servants you like yet if feels rly good when u do, since it's hard work on saving sq's especially when there are rate up banners"
Getting more used to game. I still really do NOT like event limited stuff not looping around more and poor drop rates. I am updating review to full 5 stars because help from support staff and their timely response.
I love the game but right now I'm struggling since my main account wont open anymore on my tablet and I wanna transfer it to my phone till my tablets fixed. The issue is I cant access the transfer code since I never thought to make one.
Events and units are good but the grind is unbearable and kills the game for those who do not want to waste a lot of time on it.
It has a enjoyable gameplay but as a gacha game it has a incredibly low ssr drop rates that could make players quit you could stay for the story and gameplay but dont expect to get high rarity servants often its like a miracle
Very cool
The gacha rate is hell
Its good game if we were to talk about the graphics and the mechanics of the game... but the loading time is so slow it drives me nuts... please fix.... If you could fix it I might consider playing your game again.
The the first 8 (or more) hours are terrible. It's like the developers wanted people to stop playing. There is nothing to get you to keep playing. This last event shows the developers do not care about your time. You might like it if you have a lot of time and money but it's just terrible. This game feels about as good as shoving a fork under your nail.
Terrible
"For the amount of unneccessary grinding in this game, it lacks an Auto Battle System that would make its grinding ""plausible"". Dont reccomend it unless you want to spend whole days replaying the same stupid battle by hand. If they add Auto-battle then it ""might"" be worth it. But as it is, its terribly unfun."
Solid story and gameplay
If your a free player no way your get a five star character Because I watched this video about this gotcha and if you get A four star not character card you will not get a four star or Five star character card for a ten roll so there's vary little Chance to get anything unless you have a lot money Because if anything your a free to player like me you Can be vary lucky sometimes but that's like every a hundred times you roll a single roll so don't expect this game to show you any Mercy
Its a good game but it sometimes says not available in your country
"Amazing game , best mobile game ever"
I wish they make an offline version since I only play when there's no internet.
"I'm a fan of fate series and everything is good about the content of this game. However, the gacha literally sucks! Imagine saving too many sqs, like thousands of them and got nothing but trash ce's and too much bronze servants. I've been playing this game for 6 months and it is my third acc but I never got to have the taste of any 5 ssr servants. Having lower ranked servants is also useful but there's always been a huge gap between playing with 5 ssr's and 4 - 3 ssr's."
- Good story telling. - Good graphic overall quality. - Gacha rate is lower than avg gacha games but quit accurated (1 ssr per 100 role). - Balanced game which many 1~3‚òÜ have a good potential to use even you have ssr(5‚òÜ).
Black screen on my device.
I have not tried it but it is good I love this game lol :) :D
Need better rate ups
Terrifying drain on wallet if you lack self-control. I'm doomed. This is hell you're walking into. Getting a win in gacha feels better than winning cash. Game is pretty fun tho and the story is great. Proceed with caution. Liking Fate helps.
potato luck
Nero is hot
Loving it
It's a good game but I'M SO TEMPTED TO UNINSTALL IT
"This game although with alot of cashing and questionable rate-ups, the stories and the characters are from human history. It is very wonderful bit bit, at the start I was not very invested but slowly I started loving it."
Accidentally deleted and lost all of my data. It still a really good game though lol.
Rate up is a lie but still a good game!
Fun game to kill time to :)
"Hey, that's hell ur walking into"
Break Bars ruined the game.
best gacha ever
Gacha good pay for gacha bad help me my kids are starving
"They've improved a lot with 2.0 version, especially the speed. Finally deserved 5*."
My favorite here is the story but i dont know how to link account
"400 quarts no ssr, no rate up sr :)) Very good game"
Coolest Game Ever! So Many Events & Servants.I Recommend This Game
Nice game waiting for the new update and new servants.
"Grinding to get 1000000 points isnt as fun as you think. I tried to complete the story to get the new Jeane Alter and found out that I had to grind alot of points in order to get her. Its not worth it sadly and while the game is okay, it wears out its welcome after playing it a couple of times. Best go with Chain Chronicles or Sin of Alice instead. They are much funner."
Ditme gacha nh∆∞ dbrr
After a year playing this game. It's pretty good
Worked hard for saint quartz but in the end i get a useless lancer!!!. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
I PLAY FOR WAIFUUUUUS
This is hell
I have lost all of my stuff please make a save like Google play save or Facebook save I lost all my stuff because it what load up I unstall so I can fix it I came back it work. Google play to save your progress easy to use
MY KIIIIINNNGGG!!‚ô•Ô∏è
"Originally played it ironically, but the story got really interesting. Lots of Servants and personality, gof lucky in the gacha. But it is a pain sometimes getting the Servants you want."
Good gameplay and Story line
The best game for typemoon fans
Poo poo
I love playing this game
BEST GAME EVER!!!
Needs quality of life updates. Auto mode is basically guaranteed in every game except this one. I can only have so much fun grinding.
This is one of my favorite games.
BEST GAME EVEEERRRRRR...... YEAHHH. Now gimme more SSR
Very fun wifu collecter been playing for over a year now.
Only giving it a 4 star cuz thats the only thing gacha keeps giving me.
"The drop rates in this game are unforgivable kinda forces you to spend money, I really hate this part of the game which is the hellish gacha saving up and not actually getting your waifu or the servant that you saved up for really makes me want to kill myself cause of the salt, despite that, the game still has high quality written story so theres that, so I will give it a 4‚òÜ the gacha is trash, thanks, I hate it, but I love the game overall. :)"
It's good easy to get the hang of the only problem I have with it is that the event summons is the worst I have seen in any gacha based games I have done over 30 10x pulls and not once have I got a 5* on any of the special summon
Xtra thiccc
Its addictive
Low maintenance game.
U need InsaneLuck!!! Drop rate isn't a lie.üî•
No I don't like this I would give it no star if it let me
That's Hell you're walking into
"Nice game. Just shut up. Seriously 30 seconds of gameplay followed by 3 minutes of hard to follow storyline. 30 more seconds 4 minutes of storyline. Yes you can skip it, and get lost. Could have been fun, but just summarize it. Had to strip it off. Just not enjoyable enough for the time commitment it needs. GL guys."
5 stars for being awesome
Awesome! ü§©
A game where you will be hooked
its a good game but i have a bit of problems on undestanding slmethings it should have an auto move tp where it should be used and how things should be used exept for that its a good game
"The animations are superb, the game play is great, the game follows the anime quite abit, the gacha, man it's so relaxing to play. If u love fgo u love this game"
Best fate is finally here.
TOO SLOW LOADING TIME
"Anime babes aside, its a genuinely fun game. However... brutal grind, brutal gacha. Dont expect to get what you want."
"Fun,Beautiful artwork, Moneypit"
"Don't , just don't , you'll regret waking into this hell . The story , events , characters and everything will make up for the disappoinment the gacha will give you . You're doing yourself and your wallet a favor if you don't play this game ."
Wonderful graphics and gameplay
Thw game won't even start... how am I supposed to play if it doesn't start downloading necessary content and instead display a black screen?
Just add a re-roll button for beginner first 10√ó pull please. The animation takes a century and I have to delete and download again to resummons.
Game x·∫°o l√¨n üôÉ
Love this game so addicted man love te he characters and the story as well I hope this game doest lose its color
"This game would've died eons ago if it did not have the Fate franchise's name value. Absolutely horried gacha rates with no ceiling system (advertised as 5% SSR but actually 4% of that aren't characters), and more than 90% of the character roster is ""limited."" Gameplay gets extremely repetitive and boring, and grinding outside of event is inefficient and mostly unrewarding despite being a hassle due to absolutely zero automated systems. Lastly, it has an endless power creep history (continuing)."
Really Addictive please give me summer BB üò≠üò≠
Lov this game
"How the game goes isn't too bad, but the low rates on the gacha tends to be the main problem of why it doesn't get a higher rating from me. Other than the characters, the story is a good reason why the game is good as it is."
I give u 5 star now give me ssr
üòí
"It was fun for a time, played about a year actively. But epic seven is superior to fgo in every aspect, the story, the art, the combat, the option for pvp, the pve difficulty, and the f2p viability just completely demolishes fgo"
"Worst. Friend Support System. Ever. Only shows you a few at a time, when you have 50+ friends, randomly selected to be heavily biased against friends you've used recently, and there's a timer barring you from refreshing quickly. HELLISH TEDIUM INCARNATE. Especially bad during grindy events."
"A dense but fulfilling endeavor that rewards those who invest their time with an enriching story, wonderful characters, and a wealth of strategy and depth! Not for the faint of heart, but you'll be in good hands for AT LEAST the next two years most likely!"
One of these days can u guys add a data save so each time we uninstall we don't have to restart when we install again
Great game if you enjoy the Fate series anime. Just don't hope to have your favorite servants unless you're willing to spend some money or a lot of money.
I love this game you all should add some more character like USA history and move like that
I have expent countless hours playing this game and I love it.
Your game is super good thank you for fun
Please be gentle to us DW.
Very good!
"So i went to so 10x summon. After grinding for some time. As i go to do so, the game itself during this process freezes three times. During the third it kicked me off. I went back into it to find that i did not get anything i summoned and i wasted 30 saint quartz because it. I love the game i am very upset i spent all that time only to waste what i got and getting nothing. So one star until this feezing problem is fixed."
FOR CASTORIAAAAA!!!!
Hot waifus=10/10
Idk how the manage to make a game where they turned old men from history to anime girls but they somehow did it
Really fun game great graphics and gameplay only problem I had was just u need so many saint quartz to get the servants u want but that a side it's a really great game.
Can't recover my account due to my phone needing to be factory reset because you need a random ID number and password that no normal person would just up and remeber there needs to be a back up to Google play to recover data....i sunk money into this that is now lost forever
This is hell your walking into
Hard to update.... Fun to play otherwise.
It's a lovely game with no PvP and all waifus. I've now sunk like 2 years into this game and while the story has a slow start it gets extremely good. I sugfest watching chaldea guru on youtube if your interested.
e p i c
Best anime ever
"I'm only really just starting, but I've already seen the wealth of content included in the game, sure to keep me occupied for a long time to come. Great attention to detail in all the small tips, cosmetics, and information displays, and great transparency on how the game works. Best mobile game I've found in years to keep me occupied while on my phone. Much love to the developers and all involved."
It's is my favorite game i play.
It is one of mt favorite animes to be quote honest quite well rounded. A lil slow.
"Cool game , i wish it had english voices too"
i love this Game
A good way to get into turn based games.
"Great game and addicting if ur a fate fan, must collect waifus material servants"
5/5 1 thing tho gacha is straight up hellüòÇ
"Great game. I just don't recommend this to those people who has terrible luck just like me because it's a Gacha Game. It got good story, cool turn based fight, nice graphics, history lessons and funny scenes. Good job developers, but please raise my gacha luck. Hahaha"
Make the game more f2p friendly or increase drop rates of mats
No need to say it
"Game is great, just a painful gatcha sometimes lol"
3 SSR in one month and no more
Best Game!!. Others complaining no autoplay that is why other games sucks because of the auto play. . This is the only game that even low rarirty char still matters and not left out unlike other game where low rarity character are just meh.
As a Fate game it's good. As a mobile game you can very easily beat all the content without spending any money. When your spend money on this game is when it gets bad. This game has some of the worst drop rate in any gotcha I played. So if your someone who likes to collect your going to have a bad time.
"Great game. But still can't use Saber exp, so I just burn them for Mana prism"
"The only problem with the game that i have is the gacha. Honestly it sucks, you spent all your 300 sq on a servant and still get nothing."
This is hell you're walking into l
A must game for fans of the series~
This game could be used as an example of stockholm syndrome
game will not load at all even when I'm using wifi and not data. this is the second time this happened and im tired of it.
It's FGO. Play it.
F2p and rolled skadi
Really good gacha hell game. The rate of getting a ssr servant is really low but that's the base of any rng games. There are plenty of 1-3 star servant that are really good. Anyway don't bother taking the reactions of those who give low rating to this game cause most of the time there just salty from the gacha. This game is not a pay 2 win its more of a grind to win game.
Used to work fine with my home internet but lately I had to use my mobile data just to play this since it refuses to connect with my wifi
This game liquidates my finances and gave me crippling gacha addiction. But I get jpegs of hot animu waifus so there's that.
For people who want to try this game this is hell you're walking into and I love it.
"Don't worry for not getting 4 or 5 star servant, its not a short term game its a long term game and there free good servant on events :)"
I really do like this game.
Just Great‚ù§Ô∏è
"This is a mobile game with nearly 20 chapters of story - still ongoing, with each new chapter getting better and better. It is also getting these adaptations: a 21 episode Anime // a two part Movie // an ""Endgame"" Movie - all in the span of just 3 years, with possibly even more to come. Do I need to say more?"
WELCOME TO THE HELL GACHA!
I love it üòçüòç
"T he game was great, but every time there's a new update, I always have issue updating the game from here in the Play Store. I always make sure that I have high free space of storage and stable internet connection just for FGO, but this is the 5th time that I'm having this same problem and it was during an event too. I already sent a complaint email about the problem, but still no news about it. Now, need to deal with this issue again because of the latest update made in the game üòïüôÑ"
Paid for the crystals and didnt give it to me. Thanks
Nice game.. hoping for more contents and events
While the it lacks good gameplay the story and characters make up for it
Best game Ive ever played so far from fate franchise
Yes I am yes
"Gacha rate is trash, but waifu material is great. Lets not pretend that we came here for anything besides waifus."
"One of my favorite Gatcha's on the market, it's fun and you can play completely free to play. It takes alittle while to get going but a great time if you are interested in a fate mobile game."
"loved the game, and the series, huge fan. A must play for any fan of the fate series an interesting story, colorful cast of characters, summon your favorite servants to do battle in spectacular fights 3 on 3. Highly recommended"
"If you love it, you love it"
The Game is good it's been month since i play it i really enjoy its kinda sucks that u can't get the servant you want so far the story is good too
"I changed my rating from 1 star to 5, now give Gourmet a 5 star on his next summon, otherwise the stars won't last long."
Very fun to play
"The gameplay's enjoyable, and the controls are easy enough~ The story is intriguing, and I felt compelled to keep going~ I had put it down for a while, far too long... so I missed out on a lot, but I've been enjoying the game, regardless~ Wish is was a little easier at times, but a challenge makes it fun as well~ My only real issue... well more of a nitpick... is that for the updates, they don't tell us what bugs were fixed, just that several were..."
First game i spent money on
"Great game, Good Graphics, Good Stories for entertainment."
Only game on my phone.
"It requires a bit of grinding to play well and also having good servents to get through the story but otherwise its a fun, simple game to play anytime I wish there is later a faster way to grind for matierals or be able to buy them"
That's Hell you are walking into!
The game is great and the Gacha is hell.
"Terrible gacha rates (1% 5*). No pity mechanics when summoning for limited 5* units. Gameplay is decent but many stages soon become mandatory to get meta units (Jalter, Merlin, etc.). Material drop rates are abysmal. Events are fun/comedic most of the time. No autobattle. No beginner's rewards. No communication between devs and the playerbase. Decent story. Good characters. Great waifu art. F/GO is like Beats headsets. Only popular because of the brand name but content is pretty lackluster."
No pity pull pure grind if you like that..gameplay is cool i give it a 4
"Start playing before we run out of welfare servants. This also gives time to accumulate free Currency, because the gacha is murder and the purchase ratio is criminal. If you are a fate fan, stop procrastinating because this is far far more than a spin off."
It is extremely fun
"Great game details and art work, super grind though if u like WOW grind u will like this"
GACHA HELL

"All in all awesome game, very addictive. Very fun to get rare servants especially for free to play people I have 3 five stars and 12 four stars. EDIT: Over a year later and I broke my phone and had to start over. Still love the game and doing better than ever."
Awesome game love it
i love waifus
Just got third five star skadi hoping more come out..
"Do I love it? Yes, would I recommend it? No, unless you have hours to spend grinding."
I Like It!
STONKS ‚úì
"Extraordinary and amazing game, a detailed story and many fun quests, the game play is pretty decent and addictive overall you do have to grind a bit and farm but nothing too horrible. The gotcha on the other hand can be horrible or good depending on your luck. I have maybe B luck sadly if you have EX luck you'll have no trouble with your summons ;)"
Games good great events not play to win but for some reason my phone cant connect with the server even when im on wifi ill give it 5 if they can fix it
The game freezes and stutters a lot lately. After the summer 3 event update. The game lags so bad after a while of playing the game. My phone is xiaomi redmi note 7 and this phone can handle this game good enough.
"It's heavy based pay to play , there no rewards that are good for new play , it in need for a major reboot , basically if you don't have money to spend don't bother play"
Manipulative and just wants to squeeze your wallet dry. Do not play this game.
Very amazing i loved very nice game if you havent gotten it yet then you should
Improve drop rate
Absolutely love this game huge fan of the fate series and as always great story. Wish it was easier to get good servants though.
As long as you can handle the gacha this game would be an enjoyable one to play
A game that keeps disconnecting. Despite me having 2mbps internet speed
Great game but.... raise the drop rate of 5* servants plsssssss.
"Edit (8/8/20) - I decided to give this another try with a brand new account. After a couple of weeks, I decided to throw in the towel. Welfare Ishtar wasn't bad to get, but trying to get welfare Jalter is nigh impossible in the time alotted for event (w/o playing 24/7) as a new player. Unless they take into account new players, they might as well tell them to ""screw off"" and eventually just shut down the servers."
"Played since a long time ago. Lost old account, but willing to make a new one because this is so fun"
"Great story, but paywall on gacha, only whales or extremely lucky people will get something nice. You need to farm a lot and give your soul to fgo if you want to get to lostbelt."
"Fate/Grand Order is one of my favorite phone games. Huge fan of the Fate verse. Love all the events, different servants, and the stories. Just wish we could get more quartz."
Eresh best rinface.
"INCREASE THE RATES OF SERVANTS PLEASE. Otherwise the gameplay is really good. At first glance, I thought this was a horrible gacha game because of it's rates but overtime I realized that I can live without pulling out my waifus. Yeah, it might be sad, but in life you don't get what you want, and you adapt to what you get. This game surprisingly teaches me this even tho it's a game. This is a great game tbh, the only problem would be the gacha rates."
Im drowned in gacha's hell now
love this game been playing since the start take a few break but i always come back
"awesome, I literally experienced hell"
"It is a really fun game, but they need to give more drop rate successes on those 5 stars. Getting further in the game, you maybe have 2 or 3 five stars that are pretty worthless."
Great game! Love the fate series
Best gacha imo.
"Fun, well written, expansive game. Gameplay basic but never gets too stale. Absolutely horrific drop rate on the gacha though, so beware and be realistic"
"I love it, no other game arouses my fate boner than this game"
It takes almost 5 minutes to load every single tap üò´
It's a great fun time game with time travel^^
"Literally the best mobile game to date! Few lag issues here and there and the gatcha is ULTRA frustrating, but worth it in the end. 10/10"
This is my favorite game on the play store.
"Ridiculously slow. It takes almost 30 hours of continuous play before you can grind enough premium currently for a summon, the battle system is mediocre and needlessly tedious, there's no auto battle, so you have to devote all of your attention to picking actions each turn, and one round of battle often takes at least 3 or 4 turns, the gacha rates are heartbreakingly low for how little you get to roll, the story is interesting, but it's not worth sitting through 10 minutes of monotonous gameplay"
Make another fate game but make it like bleach brave souls or kof
"I love this game I'm a huge Fate fan. And although I don't play this as often as most games I love this. I love the characters, their combat styles, weapons, and their histories. And recently when some characters got a new combat style, like Kiyohime, I fell in love with this game all over again. So thank you. And I can't wait to play more events."
great job although I want saber Nero and i can't get her so maybe make it easier to get her for the prologue please and thank you
Enough to make me question my financial stability at the age of 18.
"I managed to roll arthur, which is all that matters, so I'll give the game a four."
Amazing game! The graphics and game play itself is amazing not to mention the amazing story
I'd play so much more if it had an auto battle feature :/
"The game is fine but there is an issue that the game can't connect to the server. How do I fix this? Please help, I can't lose my account!"
Having hard time to log in when it's updated even my internet is stabled other game apps works it can you fix the server always show cannot connect the internet
"Extremely fun and entertaining, it really expands the story and characters from the anime but they should make the summoning system a bit better because you get more craft essence then you do servants and it's kind of annoying"
Gacha is hell
The skadi salt is real
"Since the last update the game always crash the sprites and UI were black Could please fix this, i love the animation"
"This game has abducted my friend's soul and virginity, fok u guys."
A great game that follows the anime perfectly and has frequent events for free servants.(also in game currency is easily accessible)
"Awe yes this is a good game for those of culture, just understand even if you like a character and spent 1500k on a game and not get it or you can use a ticket and get it. If your prone to suicide I wouldn't play."
It's a really good and fantastic game but not being able to use Google play to save one's progress is a real hindrance and headache when ones running out of space
Amazing!!!
"The game will attempt to eat your soul, rate up is a lie!! Very dangerous!"
"It's a really fun game, I just wish that 4 and 5 star servants were added to the friend point summon even if it was just 0.0000000001% chance to get them."
I just updated it yesterday morning but when I opened it again it asked me to update
I love the fate series and this game is so damn good and addictive.
Illya a cute
"Definitely gets you hooked if you love yourself anything Fate related, which is perfect for me and for you people"
"Honestly love the game, have got to the 7th Singularity so far and despite the reputation the game's gacha system has, it's pretty forgiving with things like guaranteed gold summons and the sort! Not to mention how likeable the giant cast of characters is. Overall, if you like the Fate anime, I'm sure you'd like this game, as long as you're alright with playing turn-based games like this one."
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
This was a big mistake
"F/GO is actually a solid game. The art style is okay, the story, too, and the gameplay is mediocre. It has just about enough strategy to it, though, so it doesn‚Äôt get boring too fast. But the drop rates for 4* and 5* servants are extremely low‚Äî3% and 1%? Seriously? As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the in-game currency is ridiculously hard to get. Either increasing the drop rates or making SQ more accessible would tremendously improve the experience, but right now every Gacha roll feels like a defeat."
Play it!
"aside from localization issues, it is a great game"
i love the PLOT especially the PLOT i love fgo PLOT points
"Its a gacha hell of the fate franchise. It has all the basic things a gacha game you think should have. Its not perfect and its basically a budget game with a visual novel attatched to it. The gameplay could do improvements, untrue to popular belief this game wont suck your money but itll sure do suck a lot of your time. You can progress the game soley on what the game will give you even if its rng but higher rarity and high demand servants is a nice thing to have and will make farming easier."
It's great but buggy
Hands down the best phone game I've ever played.
Grindy but I want astolfo so good game overall...
Add more guns.
"game got hard to open, whenever i try opening it just goes black screen. The game sometimes work after 10-20 times of reopening. its getting really annoying. this all happened after i switched to a better phone, but can't find the exact cause."
Relies on grinding but its nicer than other similar apps
Best RPG
"If you like min-maxing, resource management, and building the perfect team, this is a great strategy game to pick up. Many of the best utility servants are low-rarity and the Support mechanic allows you to make use of others' high-tier servants. The story gets really good around Singularity 6, and the events are lucrative as well. The only big issues are the high amount of time-locked content and unforgiving gacha, so the game does need some more bonuses for newer masters to not miss events."
"Pure f2p player, and absolutely addicted. Excellent storytelling, if a tad predictable, seemingly simple but actually complex and cerebral combat, rewarding gatcha system, etc. Couldn't recommend more! After completing the story, I only wish I could give the game 6 stars! A truly heart-wrenching story with a satisfying end that succeeds in subverting my expectations without destroying the atmosphere or ruining the stakes. Truly excellent! A second story has been released. It's pretty great!"
"I've been playing this game for 3 years and I really love this game. There has been a problem recently, it keeps saying that the game could not connect to the server. There is no problem in internet connections so I was wondering on what the problem is."
Best game worst game
"Ignoring the pain of not getting what you want, this game gives a decent amount of funds so long as you remain active or at least login. While having an SSR is nice, you don't actual need them to progress in the game. Even a team of Rares and below can take down endgame content. Just takes time and dedication to get rewarded. But if you can't, enjoy the ride and story. Love the game, love the design, love the content. Really exceptional game here but the rest of the franchise is something else."
love the game (hate the gacha) but besides the gacha its great game even if you arnt into the fate franchise this a great game and im certain youl love it and the charaters with it
game that proves Luck all it mattersüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"This game is ruining my life. Sold my house, lost the wife and kids, and in debt because of this game. 10/10 would simp for jpeg again."
"it's a good game, but it's annoying theres no pity rewards, game is highly rng based"
Didn't get skadi with 150+ rolls
It's top
"i can't update my game, it just tall watting for update but nohing happening"
"Gameplay is uniquely boring, UI/UX is outdated and gacha is extra-brutal on both sanity and wallet (< 1%, no pity). If you have luxury of spending thousands on collecting famous pixels - this is your Grail."
"Good game, too bad the devs refuse to update the game so it will run on Android 10 after an entire month."
Beautiful Game.
"The game is great. Gameplay, Graphics and Story are simple but very good and done just right. The gacha isn't very forgiving tho but even as f2p you shouldn't have any problems progressing through the game with 3-4 star servants. Everything about the game is good except the gacha and grinding."
This is honestly the best game i have ever played...waited for it about 2years.....(my phone dont work onthis game)until i recently bought a new one 2 years after hahahahah
"Great time killer. Takes a while to finish so enjoy about 3 months. Edit: took longer than expected, currently not finished"
It's so good um so addicted in fat series even the series im watching it and the game i play it too it's so good super good!!‚ù§‚ù§
Fix drop rate lel
Best Mobile game ever
I regret many things. This is one of them.
Give guaranteed event CEs plz thanks
Very fun. Entertaining characters. Fun events. New players can enjoy this game even with common units.
The Gacha rates wants me to commit sudoku
This game to me is a blast to play!!
Boost your Summon PERCENTAGE PLS BUT I LOVE THE GAME AND THE STORYLINE
"Trash luck so 4 stars, great game though"
Welcome to grind hell.
Amazingly cool
I like this game Gilgamesh e√±uma elish!!!!!
"I adore this series and this game. I love the character designs, story, and the fact that it takes months to reach a point in the game where you might feel even a little bit pressured to spend any money to have a chance at continuing the game. There's always new content coming out, and it's just a good time. But recently I had to change devices and while I have the transfer code, I don't have the password for my account. There is no way to recover it? Kinda spoils game play when I can't playüò≠"
"The game is all around great, and I love the Fate series. One issue that seems to recently sprung up for me is when SummerFes was introduced, the game seems to freeze up randomly time to time. It would be nice for this to be fix, as it is rather annoying to have to restart the game whenever it does."
Awesome ^^
Listing the things I love about this game and trying to watch the series in chronological order fall into the same boat that being I don't even know where to start this game is a masterpiece thx
Very fun and addicting. You can also collect your favorite servants from Fate/Stay night and some new ones (if your lucky enough to roll them in the gacha)
The rates on this game are horrible to get characters 5‚òÜservant 1% 4‚òÜservant 3% and 3‚òÜservant 40%. I still enjoy the game and love the fate series.
This games is amazing
Its amazing!
Great Waifu
Love this game i hope they make more of this games tho im not a fan of 2d games i like this one.. I hope they make Fgo arcade mobile or fate extella links pvp i like those better on mobile
"5 stars before update. Ready to uninstall after update. Game crashes 100% of the time during the final battle. Have to reload every time, however it does resume, but very irritating."
Nice Game super great üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
The game is good but the constant worry of losing to much ap or losing to much ap is a annoying and a bit of a problem
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I love the app
I never got any 5 stars
"Great game, however when you do a 10x pull you're supposed to get a 4 star servant but I just pulled and got no 4 star and a bunch of craft essence."
"Simple mechanics, great graphics, very fun overall"
Best anime game ever. Love it! No need to buy good units.
very good game
The one big problem I have with it is if you accidentally uninstall it all your data is gone no matter how much money you put into it
You get way too many craft essences when doing summons and the servants all seem to be the same with a next to none chance of getting anything new
Its a fate game
Draw odds are bad but all in all a fun game
A really fun game but wouldn't recommend it if you hate grinding for materials in games
Give archer gil and i will change.
Gacha gacha gacha
Loading screen wont pop up sometimes and screen goes blank
My favorite game...would not recommend
"One of if not my favorite mobile game. You don't need to know anything about the other Fate/ series to enjoy the game though knowing of them adds to the experience. My only problem is that the gacha(draw) system has kind of a ridiculously bad draw chance for the five star characters, though lately I've had really great luck for the last three event gacha draws at this point in time so I don't know if that means anything or not."
why i can't update my Fgo and i didn't even get my transfer code please helpüò£
It's a good game Though I had found out I think I have c or d ranked luck because I get mostly 1 star or sometimes 2 or 3 stars on servants and mostly craftessences I'm still playing the game though. Update now I think I have b+ rank or a ranked luck most of the sr and ssr servants are divine or 5 star after one roll and ticket pull.
"The game is... Okay. Visually, it's beautiful. The gameplay is okay. The story is okay. The gacha rates are absolutely horrific and the premium currency is costly. The free currency is relatively hard to come by as well. Hesitant recommendation to Fate fans, everyone else should probably steer clear."
"A gacha game like any other. It has a good story and characters, but it also has terrible rates. Honestly, I love this game but they need to implement some sort of pity system."
Love this game. Cant wait for kama
It's fun but it glitch alot
I love my Proto King Arthur.
"Fairly good game, pretty average as far as jrpg's go. Got repetative after a while but still fun regardless"
"Very addicting, and a lot of fun"
The best hero collector I've ever played.
Time to update review. 3 years in and still a good game. Obviously still alot of grinding and Gacha rate up is a lie. Pseudo singularity are ok but Lost Belt story arc is really good . Still 4/5 for me.
"Nice, simple, entertaining. Use to have long wait, between screens... but that seems much better."
Hellhole they say and I jumped in it.
Excellent fun even if the gacha makes me salty...
Poor communication from developers and the rewards are gimped when compared with other regions. Edit: Really improved communication and they've been fast tracking QOL updates. They've fixed alot of the issues.
"Wow, yes. Very yes"
"It needs an automatic battle button, because is kind annoying only defeat minions also incrase banners rates even more."
"Its a fate gacha game, good luck getting your wifus and may the gotcha gods be ever in your favor."
"The game overall is fun and has a driving story. Team building is fun although difficult when you're new. You also do need to grind a bit for ascension mats and during events. Now the gacha is a matter of probability. You have a 3% chance to get a 4 star servant and a 1% chance to get a 5%. Now it can be utter hell, virtual rolling without success after a lot of summons, then rolling in the actual game can help as you're bound to hit the 1% chance eventually."
Gameplay is fun but rng for servant pulls is some of the worst ones out there.
Hey thats hell you're walking into
"I love it even its so hard in gacha. Saya sangat menyukai karakter dan animasinya. Jalan ceritanya pun bagus, jadi saya bisa mengikuti dengan mudah. Tapi level upnya cukup susah . But afteralll is the best game."
RPG THERAPY
"While FGO is a gacha game with ridiculously low drop rates, it's in no way pay to win. You can clear most all events and the stort with 1-3 star servants, so you don't really need to blow all that much money, just time for that grind. The art and music are pretty nice, and the Fate waifus are great. Story's surprisingly decent as well."
It was good and the controls were good the storyline made sense so it was a all around good game
Salt make life more sad
Great game. Started playing it just to watch the anime but ended up getting hooked.
The pinnacle of Fate experience. A must download for Fate fans.
This is the hell I walked into.
Get out when you have a chance
"Simple and fun, that's all I could say."
Id rate it a 5 if my RNG was better.
I love this game so much!!! I it's fun to play
"Removed 1 star due to one element, RNG. This game is good but, rolling is so salty... Tell me how 1% isnt 1/100. I shouldve gotten them withing 300+ sq, but nope, not even once I got them. As being f2p, the only way I get sq is through log ins, not if you whale. How the hell am I suppose to rack sq when I already cleared all free quests? Heres a suggestion, make a dungeon you can clear everyday, for only 1 sq, but it can only be done once per day, but what are the chances of them reading this."
Fun game with a solid story.
This is a good game and it has a grate story line I would recommend anyone who is in to this to play u will love it
pretty decent game.
I was a fan of the show so wen I seen this and started to play it fell in love I like it
Great gameplay and great story just wish getting a 5 star wasn't 1 percent
The best game
Wonderful
Dis game is really addicting collecting different servants and amazing events
"A great game ! It makes we want to surf for facts about historical and mythological figures! But still, rate up is a lie :D"
"Games mechanic and storyline are nice, but the client is very laggy and slow for some low end phones, which can make players get bored of the game (for loading too long) Also i hope you can add the bind system too."
I just spent equivalently 1500 quartz without a single 5 star summon.
FGO is undisputedly an amazing online mobile RPG and thr storytelling is truly top-notched
Salt
shoddy rushed translation. the game is good but you just should have taken more time for a polished product and worked on flow for writing and characters dialogue. will update rating if you ever fix it.
"That's hell you are walking into. The spiralling hell that is gacha gaming, really bad gacha rate practically rate up is a lie. Story is good, but too long and Grindy too. All the characters are voiced properly. Would be better if the graphic can be improved following better phone computing prowess."
Most 1-3 stars are usable and some are quite strong unlike most gacha games
"Been playing for more than 3 years now. I'd say those who rated this low are just unlucky :v lol I have 28 SSRs with NP2 Altera, Gil, Karna and Nero Caster and I'm F2P btw :D i have so much fun playing this game :3"
"4 and 5 star servants drop ATROCIOUSLY low, which is frustrating, graphics are like a flash game, only thing going for it is the Fate IP. All in all, usual gacha game. Play at your own risk"
"VERY NICE CAN PLAY F2P IF U HAVE PATIENCE PLS DONT WHALE NOT WORTH IT, I WISH TO THOUGHS WHO WHALE A LOT TO THIS GAME WILL NOT BE BLESSED BY RNjesus AND MAY RECIEVE A BUNCH OF MAPO TOFU INSTEAD GOODLUCK"
"I'm not really a fan of mobile games but after playing this (esp. this is from one of my fave anime), I began to love it! The only prob may be my C-rank Luck boohhoo Edited: yay! It seems like my luck became B rank! Thanks FGo! I'm gonna edit this to five star if I got HOLMES!"
Drop rate of ssr servants lower than jp server that stinks
"One of the best game ever, i got my Kiyo NP 5. The LB story is amazing, more event coming."
"Been a fan of the Fate series for years, knew about Grand Order but was super excited when I found out that it had been ported to the US. Excellent game, my only complaint is about the lottery-styled gacha that determines whether or not you can get your favorite servants. Edit, two years later Still playing, love the game and the story onle gets better. I understand the need for the Gacha, no Gacha, no funding, no game. Altogether- worth the investment, in my own opinion"
Cuz why not
"It really is terribly optimized, but everything else is either great or satisfactory. Fantastic story is just the top of the mountain. And it is a mountain. Edit: optimization is great now."
"I have minor problem. You know how on the top right corner of the screen where the game shows you the amount of mats and qp and embers and stuff you get? Well clicking that button only shows you the amount of materials you have, AND ONLY MATS. I WANNA KNOW HOW MANY EMBERS I HAVE! I know this is pretty nitpicky, and it is. So far the game is great, but they seem to add handy features later, like the cancel comand card button near the bottom right corner. So far, a great game i recomend to all."
One of the best mobile games
"So, I've been playing the game for almost a month now and can't get my consecutive 7 day reward. It keeps saying I missed the last day but that's a lie."
SALTY
that's hell you're walking to
Game doesn't load properly on oppo r17. Excessively long loading times on Android compared to ios
I love this gacha game. The rates are brutal but all of the units are usable. The game is more about story and characters than anything else. It's one of my favorite games ever.
"Its ruined my life, but the anime pussi game is insane."
It's a trash game and i love it so I'm gonna give it a 3 star like mappo tofu
Give in to the salt
Naisu
Plain awesome
The game has good OST and gameplay but it's a miserable excuse in the terms of gacha. The rates for a SSR is pitiful. A measly 1% and that's not counting the excessive number of Craft Essences that'll constantly leave you with dead multis. If you can't handle saving for months and getting thrashed then you should quit. If you wanna win pay a lot of money. Simply put. Gameplay? Good. Grinding? Neverending. Music? Good. Summoning For Units? A joke compared to other game like Dokkan.
Good gameplay and story but the gacha rates are next to abysmal
I get bored easily but I love the heroic spirits so I'm still gonna play hahaha even though my old account gave me all sabers
Just because they told me to
"Great Game, can complete it w/o SSRs"
great game overall
Great UwU app!!!
"A fun F2P game, no need for paid gatcha to get decent servants. Can be played casually to pass time, or you can go deep the rabbit hole if you want to. Fun events and best of all, the story is engaging."
Would spend my life savings again
Enjoyable
This is the best mobile game I have ever played hands down.
Save your money this game is more expensive than drugs
Waifus. That is all.
Best plot
LOVE THE GACHA EXPERIENCE I ALMOST DIED
Most hellish gatcha game ever that you'll get addicted into and bring you to despair üòà
"My wallet is empty but I am happy Edit: My wallet is literally empty now, I am financially bankrupt"
"Pros: Visual Novel style story telling. Great characters to enjoy and grow with. Fun fighting mechanics. Waifus. Memes. Waifus. More memes. More waifus. Con: Needs more waifus. Needs more memes. Update. Today is 8/3/20 I am still playing this game to this day. With its updates finally catching up with JP, it's only gotten better. The gancha still hurts. Even took $500 to get 1 of Ereshkigal. But I have my cinnamon bun home. The game IS F2P friendly if you do go that route."
"Gameplay is very repetitive and very grindy, UI is outdated compared to other games, but they hit you with non stop events and for some reason you seem to just cant stop playing after a while, the gacha rates can be turbo trash, but if you research a bit about all the low rarity units in the game, the game can be beaten with just 1~3* servants. Pretty fun"
"Yeah, I'm lucky"
"Story is mediocre at first and gradually gets better. Team building is crucial in the later stages of the game. Low rarity servants are useable late game. The gacha rate is low even with rate up as a factor. Grinding for leveling materials varies by servant, but is still grindy. Events are fun, but really grindy without certain in-game items that are obtained through the gacha. Needs a better variety of music."
"Great game, great story, great characters."
worst mobage !! fight me !!
Lee game
"Great game but man is that gacha rate up a real lie. You gotta whale to get the real high tier limited or event servants or sell your soul to satan. I mean, I'm still gonna play and I still love the game but you know."
"Game is good as an experience, but as an actual game it can be aggravating. Story and lore wise, I have yet to see any other game to even remotely challenge this game. But as said the gameplay is rather so and so. It requires large amounts of grinding, patience and luck. Even if you dont have a good team, the community will help out with their support. Unfortunately as you continue, you really need your own good team with the rates as they are? Good luck. Overall though good enough for me."
People die if they are killed
I been playing for 2 years this game is amazing when I play it I feel what my main character feels and likes to befriend and save all the world and all of time this game makes me happy to be a master being with the servants is like a big family this game contains bonds friendship and hardship this game a true experience he even teaches you myths I love playing it I wont ever turn my back on it
"I've been playing for about three months and it's been fun, other than the gacha (which has horrendous rates for a 5*) the game has great characters and an intriguing story"
"Yeah, the Gacha rates suck. But this is still the best and fairest Gacha game out there. Great story, year one 5* Servants are still viable, no gimmicky three star clear requirements on nodes, lower rarity Servants with proper TLC can clear most of the game...thumbs up for me 100%"
to boring crappy
I played for like 15 minutes. Spend more time loading into chapters to fight than the actual game play.
Story's absolutely wonderful and many Servants have great personalities
"meh, waifus"
Bless me RNG gods üôè
"Story: Kinda rough in the start but gets better once you reach the sixth chapter. The story gets good from there. Events: Usually worth giving a read your first go-around, as its usually pretty funny. Best time to get good materials for strengthening Gameplay: Simple to learn, intermediate to master. For mobile its okay, you select cards, characters have 3 skills, and you have 3, also. Gacha: Low chance for 5stars even on rate up, my advice is dont impulse roll for just anyone- save for the best"
I have been trying to recover my account for two weeks by emailing back and forth with customer support. I will change it to 5 stars once I get access back to my old account.
"It's okay, not very intricate( a standard of mobile games),its so heavy handed about microtransactions that the game overall sucks. Any good character is locked behind the gachapon system and they purposely make ""rolls"" as difficult to get as possible, so you will never really get the good characters without paying substantially. Furthermore, their posted odds are a straight lie. When they say 3% chance, they mean 3% of that tiers pool so a rare characters chances are less than .01% in actuality"
"Told me it was hell, confirmed it , no regrets."
No auto waste of time no good for new players
"pros: engaging story, little to no powercreep. cons: terrible gacha rates, high stamina costs, laggy even after game data has been downloaded. personal con: servants & events are clearly made to pander to a male audience. new variants of female servants come out nonstop, while male servants might get a new costume once in a blue moon. the devs will sexualize the hell out of females (even literal children), but god forbid they add a swimsuit version of a male character to the summoning pool."
Meh.. Loading is extremely slow. Drop rates are terrible!
Bae-toria .. enough said
It's a fun game no problems as far as graphics or gameplay and I like the variety of characters
Very bad gacha drop off very poor..
Great game. Shot gacha
I thought this game would be good and is except for the fact they mess you over. I new and went to do the race event great story was looking forward to getting Ishtar got to the final bridge seen was trying to hurry only had a day left and says I can't finish I'm not level 90. Pretty messed up guess only get good hero's if you have played awhile
Love the series
"Well the game can be interesting at times. Although in the long run, it can be pretty stale and lackluster. Decent graphics and story. Okay music. Maybe get l2d or different battle angle to spice up the game a little bit"
The best gacha game for me üíìüíì
I've been reading the reviews for the game it's really funny how some complain that the game doesn't have an auto battle system and how the rate up is trash XD The funniest one is that they get salty because they couldn't get any ssr hahahhahahah I guess kotomine backstabbed them while they were rolling. I've seen people who have utilized low tier servants and even beat Goetia with a f2p line up I guess some people aren't really that smart. Also I beat Goetia with Astolfo one of the worst rider
"I have a good luck in this game, so i need to thanks DW by giving 5 stars"
Over all the story is my most fav thing and the gameplay as well as characters are awsome.
soo good
"Terrible summon rates that can't even give me the supposed rate up 4 star (don't care about the 5 star) after many multi summons way in the double digits, no auto battle, outdated general UI, barely interesting story and only sells because of fans who like fate. It's a shame because I love the Fate franchise as a whole, too bad the gacha sucks. Fix your game."
Awsome game
"This game will be better if it accept payment method from sea region, i can't buy quartz because this game doesn't accept payment method in my country (Ind)"
Misleading came for the the hot waifu adds get here and get a bunch of topless dudes and game play kinda boring sorry being honest think ill go back to playing epic 7
my wife left me because of my addiction to this game
Really fun I play most days.
"Fgo is a great game for getting your fate Waifus and a great story. The pros: great story in events and just regular story mode, also top notch Waifus, and very nice animations overall. The cons: You have to manually grind everything, u need to farm exp cards, no pity system, and gameplay can get repetitive once u play a lot. I advise noone to play unless they want a job doing the same missions for 8hrs in an event to clear the shop. Overall good game and a solid 4 star."
Interesting
I am a new player. The game is easy to play and have very good story from the very beginning. It would be good if we could have guild or community. The energy system is just too slow and high lvl quests consume too much of it.
Luck
"It's amazing, although I've never watch the anime, the game experience makes me feel like I'm actually in the game, I love the combat, the story arc, the seasonal events, and everything else, I hope this game will continue for a long time to come!!!!"
Ishtar Feet.
"You watch anime? Great. You watch Fate series? Great, all of them? Fabulous! This game is a sinkhole and its hell down here, come on and join the clubüòÄ"
"I love this game, the stories are really good characters are also really good even of they are lower rarity. And the gameplay is simple and requires some strategies. But there are still flaws in this game the gacha in this game is pretty bad, and grinding is hell sometime."
Wonderful and we'll made game that has an interesting story and gameplay
Fun. No paywall. Grindy
Went to load game on new and same phone but really it was transfered over with Google and blue tooth. Lost 200 hours of playing time and great carracters and all my progress. Still can't get info or saved data back. Loved the game before I lost everything do to a phone change.
I got Ereshkigal
"Nice game if you like grinding, story and waifus"
"I really enjoyed this game for at least a month I had fun , and it had its moments but getting the servant that I want (A.K.A Astolfo) is just too hard and expensive I wish it was easier"
This game is a pay to win game. Leveling a servant up needs so much and at the start it's already really hard. Basically making yourself stronger takes such a long time even getting saint quarts takes a long time it usually takes 1+hours just to get 30 and to top it all of when you use that hard earned 30 saint quarts you get bad servants. To be honest I've heard so many people complain that this is a pay to win game. I've played so many gacha games and so far this one is the hardest like super.
Humongous game with engaging lore and characters for every taste. Farming is a bit tedious but story quests are great.
"Has potential the gameplay, story, and graphics are great. BUT THE DROP RATES FOR DECENT CHARACTERS ARE HORRIBLE & RANKING EACH CHARACTER UPIS EVEN MORE HORRIBLE!!! This game is to grindy for those who don't have that much time in the day bcus of family and work. Difficulty level is kind of high considering you can get decent characters or rank of characters fast enough to keep up with the game. Fix these few things and I'll give 5*s. Oh yeah login rewards are meh"
Addicting cause Wamen.
"Been pretty amused by this. I love all the characters, its an adorbale game and its fun."
Warnning: Gacha hell alert!
"Thank you so much for fixing the problem, now i can play the game thank you"
When ishtar is 12
The only game I am playing on mobile. Best casual fate game!
Gacha be hell but story be interesting.
How can I recover my lost account? It was deleted by accident and I need it back
"Overall, a great game."
"Gameplay is decent and the recent engine update helps massively on the loading time. However, graphics-wise, there are better ones out there. The biggest complain is the horrible gacha rates (1%) and even the pity system if it even counts. At least make the paid guaranteed summons more often? :p The game is pretty much bankrolling on the Fate IP."
This game's a f**king joke.
Yorokobe shounen! *intensely eat extra spicy mapo tofu*
Bruh.
Uninstallment speed run WR: 8 secs
Worse gacha rate up üò¢ rate up is a lie dont even think about saving sq
A good game. Gacha salt is real though.
Game is nice and all but it needs some autoplay function
"Great game, only problem i have is the slow time and drop in frames when i do gachas i can do over 100 friendship draws but it takes so long even when skipping that i haven't done it due to the slow gacha time"
"Very fun game with memorable characters and story. It is extremely f2p friendly, unless you want every single character. Some of the best character design, art, and storytelling in gacha gaming."
I'm keeping this at one star until I get Astolfo... Sorry not sorry
Great game. It's pay to win better. You can play it without paying but it will be easier if you did whale.
gacha hell is real
There's so much content. If you like fate then this game is obviously for you. Just hold on to your wallet because those rate ups will getcha.
"The game wouldn't let me get on and I had to delete the game. Forget this game I just over half way through when this happened, now I have to start from square one. I'm not playing this game anymore."
"Yeah whatever great game, horrible rates. still f2p with 19 SSrs. Umu ( Àò ¬≥Àò)‚ô•"
Rate up is a lie lol. Otherwise its a old but gold game i suppose nothing super wowing but nothing super terrible either. Its one of the grandpappys of gacha so I'll rate it well for surviving this long. Too bad EN is a literal 2 years behind JP and reruns are rare for events
This is hell but good
"It will take your money away. The rates don't feel real, but I cannot properly judge that. Otherwise it is full of waifus. :)"
"I really like this game, although it is very sad in parts, and I got really into the storyline."
Kinda sad it wont work :(
"To much loading time. Loading here, loading there.. so much unnecessary loading that it's to much it doesn't make any sense!? I mean no data been used while the game is loading. So why does it has to make alot of loads?? Like literally ALOT!!"
I don't know what is going on with the game. It having massive issues with loading. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it. Now it won't even load up. It just freezes up at the load-in screen.
i cant seem to connect to the game without the use of vpn in the past few days
Mocking hindu gods.

"I had heard about people spending crazy money on this game so i thought you needed to spend. However you don't really need to, good stories, simple game mechanics. If you're not adamant about playing with your favorite servant you don't need to spend at all."
I love the plot
"Game looks good, story is interesting, but gameplay is grindy and the gacha is not generous, making it really hard to enjoy it as a free mobile game"
"Great game that makes me feel like my time is well spent playing it. Gacha rates are some of the lowest around but high rarity characters aren't required to enjoy the game (unless you hard rollin for them waifus/meta). No pvp means you can enjoy at your own pace and not have to worry about matching up to the whales/heavy spenders. Story is extremely well written and engaging, though the visual novel format feels a little bland at times."
I Love This Game The Fate Grand Order is so Cool
"Got into fgo because of a dare from my friend (I challenged him to play Honkai Impact 3 while he challenged me to fgo). To be honest, after 42 levels in, I'm still not impressed. Probably because I'm looking from the point of view of hi3, a game with much better gameplay and graphics. Fgo is a classic 2d match three turn based character collection gacha rpg. The rates in the gacha is hell, and the gameplay is, in my opinion, kinda meh. Graphics wise, it's all right. Voice acting is superb."
Good story. Gotcha system kinda sucks Save a lot for your favorite character because you will need it and more. I just spent 600 quartz on the banner and no gold servant. Absolutely terrible.
It was fine. A fun time waste in a good way!
In all honesty cant really say anything bad about this game . i love it . free to play players have a solid chance to be great with patience . the summons can be merciless but other than that i love it
Great üëç
I loved Fate!
Listen. RATE UP IS A LIE
"If you're a fan of the FATE series then this is a great way of getting more of what you love. If you are a fan of gacha games, then this isn't the game for you. Rates are trash and the price for quartz (premium currency) is dummy high. Simply to learn gameplay, but difficult to master and there are so many strategies that can be created with different teams. Story starts off slow and would recommend skipping around if you aren't in the mood to read until the 6th chapter. Overall fun time :)"
This game has shown me what bad civilization is... and I love it.
Grindy and repetive as hell
"No idea this game so popular, gameplay so boring"
It's definitely not a bad game. I lowkey enjoy it quite a bit
The game is fun and salt rubbing against internet stranger/friend makes the game more enjoyable
meh
I really love this game!
Amazing and fun to play
Good civilization
"Collection game of waifus, The Great Bait of Fate"
It's just a gushy game Not worth people's time
"It's a pretty good time killer. The gameplay is also very lit and undoubtedly high quality. The only downside is the farming of materials. I suggest that you add an ""auto-clear"" option after you have cleared a certain level. Cause most of the time, grinding for materials is taking too long."
"The gacha is hell, but I knew that going in. The gameplay is not much to write home about, but it does it's job well. The story of Camelot onward is outright masterful. The graphics are slightly better than what I expected of a mobile game. The characters are what really make the game worth it, and I hope that the same love and attention to detail will continue with future servants."
Best game ever! But i have E luck
Well nothing much to say but: - Muramasa when - Avalon when(instinct sucks)
Super good. And amazing story
I love Mashu.
I bought saint quartz and the purchase was cancelled. But i was credited. Tried emailing customer support and no response.
"It is a great app, works beautifully. Amazing story with good gameplay."
Great game! A lot of variety. But the best part is its spectacular Support Team. Amazing stuff all around and cheers to future business with you guys.
Summons dont give me anything and its not fun or fair
The ruler class of gatcha games
Fun but I really hate that 80 dollars only give 90 saint quarts when the thing I want to do is 30 saint quarts and I want avenger of shinjuku but he's star five and summons dont give five stars
one of the better gacha games but a little too harsh with the rates of 5* and 4*. if there was a guaranteed 4* after a certain amount of rolls it would be more enjoyable I think.
Wassup my homies. Buster > Quick > Arts. Or. Interchangeable whenever new Servant comes out. People die if they're killed.
"Waifus are worth it. (& yes this is edited, loading is better.)"
"That's hell you're walking into. The story starts of strong and only continues to get better. Character have great art and are fun to play with. Backgrounds are constantly recycled but are not too annoying, music is phenomenal but can be just as overused. Gameplay is fun but grinding for mats is what you'll mostly be doing. Gacha is hell with a base SSR rate of 0.035%. Like a VN, dialogue can take anywhere from 5 to 35 mins. Tldr: Story is amazing but Rate-Up is a Lie."
Improve the game art environments and the background cutscenes
quite salty
"Fun game, but rate up is a lie MAN I JUST NEED A SKADI"
Was very into this game at one point but the story drags on and gets kida stupid after a certain point The events are fun but grinding for items to level up your servants is tedious
History simulator
"A fun story based game that rewards you for having friends by letting you use their heroes, but never veers from its single player gameplay. Love it. Excellent writing as well!"
"Weeb:download fgo Me:Hey kid that's ""Hell"" you walk into!"
Salt mine simulator
Looooove it.
Been playing for months now... About to reach a year playing this game on January. Yet still doesn't have a 5 star servant. (‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•) (Update) God has been kind enough to grant me 4 ssrs and a np2 musashi. All is well now.
It's good game only real downside is the summoning system but its gotta make money and overall I've had great luck with my summons. It's the only mobile game I have that I actually care about
Really great game!
"It's frustrating not to get 5 stars characters but it is well made that even 1 star characters if used correctly can defeat a high level boss. Excellent Story, Gameplay, and Graphics. This deserves 5 stars"
5 stars even i didn't get 5 star servant üôÉ
Gud civil
Rating 5 stars to please the SSR Gacha gods
Please implement a feature to save me hours of grinding. I already know the outcome of a battle and I have to waste hours of my life sitting through it? Please. I'll update my rating till then.
The gacha is just cruel and merciless.
"I love the characters, the historical and pop culture references, the plot and how each character are intertwined with each other. Regarding the gacha roll, please lower your expectations. You can still progress with 1-3 star servants."
G A C H A H E L L
It's a good game so addicting
Love the story and characters. Recent improvements have made game play better. The gacha is wacked compared to other gachas I have done; sometimes it drags you through whale hell and only 1 SSR servant to show and sometimes you that 1-2 free ticket luck. Expanding story keeps it going.
"One of the games i really enjoy a lot playing on mobile. Despite what people may say of rates, gameplay and such; this game is really fun. I really recommend it to anyone to give it a shot."
good game git gud
"There are some obvious improvements this game could get, some of which are shown in the JP verision, and some of which are not, like a higher SSR Servant Pull Rate. Still, the story is great and the game play is fairly good. If I had to recommend any Gacha, it would be this one."
The game and graphics are overall good. It is a great strategy game but can do a real number on the wallet if you are trying to go big.
Dev are very good at staying ontop of bugs and there are a lot of events
big ass tities and small ones too
It awesome it feels like im apart of the time
Good game for fate fans. Don't know for new comers though. Good side is: I love the gameplay the story and the characters especially in lostbelt story. Even the crypters' own story was pretty good. Grindy for mats but atleast they're free. Not much p2w imo. F2p btw. Downside: 2 years worth of delayed content from the JP server. When you try to pull for your desired servants and didnt get them you feel broken. Story dont have voice overs(but acceptable). Dated graphics compared to newer games
app opens then closes for me plz help dont wanna risk loosing my account
Best game I've ever played. The gacha isn't pleasant though ( ;-;)
Good stuff Graphics Engine update really made the game shine.
Excelente juego y mas aun si eren fan de la saga.
I have been a member of this beautiful journey into hell since the English release. 10/10 will go to gacha hell again.
Make my pp hard
"I played this game since singularity 5 or 6 around 2018, and i sank some good money into it. I got bored and stopped for awhile a couple months back. Ended up deleting it to make space for new apps. I bound my account back when i first started playing and i dont remember it asking to set a password! I wanted to play, but now i have no way to recover my accountüò°. Not cool Aniplex! Other than that great game, great story. Improve the gacha rates juat a smidge and it would knock out the competion"
"I really want to like fate as a fan of the anime and community. But those rare drops man are deadly with how little rewarding it is. I had 3, 5 stared servants and had to reset my progress due to transferring new phones. But christ man no new 5 stars after many 12 rolls. App is fine if you want something to distract"
Would be a LOT better if I could get my favorite characters but no. Every single one of these stupid games have to be random because people have no clue how to make a good game
Thanks for skadi
"This game is perfect ""-"""
Oof
"I forgot to review this game. Lol. Been playing for more than 2 years. Even with the horrible gacha rates you can still win the game using freebie and lower star units. The game is so great nd enjoyable! In story and characters, especially waifus. Also the new engine update makes the game play smooth. Hoping for the best in the future!"
"Fun good graphics, gachas kinda hell though but you'll know get pass it. (I'll suck all your luck including newbie, f2p, casual, long time, whale player) good luck on try not to quit the game if you don't have any quartz left to role for waifus."
5 star cause i got skadi

"Overall its not a bad game, however its pretty much agreed upon by many who play gacha games that this has one of the worst drop rates around (some games are worse but this is still pretty unbearable). Its not a bad game but due to low drop rates and infrequent summoning, you probably won't be getting anything of high rarity. Still playable otherwise but from a casual collector's perspective, I find it hard to recommend to people who aren't into the Fate series."
Excellent storyline. Good character development and amusing gameplay.
10/10 would spend over 100 dollars for a png again
Just got to London and it is amazing. Downloaded everything I get a new phone. Just wish it would automatically save my progress with my Google account so I don't have to start over every time.
Just Spam Reroll and ger Heracles and you'll have the most fun. üòÇ
"Fantastic game! I've loved the Fate series' for years, and this is like an ""All-Star"" game for the entire run. The play style is pretty straightforward, and the graphics (especially the Noble Phantasms) are great! The Event giveaways really help those, like myself, get a jump on the rest of the game, early on. Having to pay (sometimes INSANE amounts) to get the BEST characters is irritating; but you can EASILY play this game without paying a nickle! HAPPY 3RD ANNIVERSARY FGO!!!"
Great game but it's hard to get new five-star characters without spending real money
"I really enjoy this game but I'm not sure if I would if I didn't already love the fate series. But since I do, I have a lot of fun with it. The story is surprisingly good for a mobile game and I laughed out loud a couple times from the writing. The combat is very simple but well executed. Astolfo is best boi"
If you plan on whaling then this game is great otherwise I'd avoid this game
"Great game, nice graphics, welcome to gacha hell"
Need more content for f2p players
One Of The Best Games Ever So Worth It Blade Works Is One Of My Favorites Along With Mash Time Line
Good game I guess
it was great but can they put online pvp
For the truly cultured
"The game is very good overall, the story on 1st part is decent, but on 2nd part it get's better. The animation are great and the gameplay is easy to get into although it's pretty hard to build good team if you're new player. But this can be offset by the good 3-4 star choice that you can easily get. The bad side is only the gacha and the heavy grinding nature of the game.Overall it take a while to get into, but if you've already have a good team it will be enjoyable to play especially for F2P"
I CANNOT OPEN IT
"good game. To be able to know more our servants I suggest to enable us players to see the description of active skills of the unavailable ones which requires ascension to just be able to see it. It is a hassle, only showing us 1 active skill upon obtaining a servant? what if that 1st active skill is not that great but the 2nd and 3rd are, as i have said they're not available to be seen unless achieving ascension of that servant."
(Y)
Love the game but hate the grinding. Makes me sleepy. Can they make it easier on the grinding. Just sayingü§ó
Nc game its back to normal üòä
Came back to the game after a long break but i gave it another chance only to find myself reaching for my wallet for that skadi lol love the game but i wish i could play on multiple devices(same account) i do this on bbs and 7ds.
What is epic7?
Been playing this game for 2 years+ but one day out of no where my account got hacked and transferred to another device without my knowledge. Went to support to try to get it back. But they said they couldn't verify the circumstances or events that have transpired and they cannot provide further assistance. Also because since the account in question is active. They cannot verify my account ownership and take further actions despite sending them all my Google play store transactions id to them.
"Amazing art, story, characters, soundtrack, and gameplay. Most of them feel way too good for a free to play mobile game. Like others say the gacha is punishing and soul crushing but they give you a good number of free quartz. Not enough to get every servant you want but you'll be able to get a few good SSR ones. And it makes those few times you get them feel amazing. This game can also be beaten without a single SSR if you know how to play it so it's not P2W."
Salt salt and add more salt.
It's a lot more engaging then what people would normally expect.
Wow this game is soooo boring lol
"Highly recommend if you are a fan of fate series. Still recommend if you just want to try it out, ignoring all the rants about rate-ups this is a pretty good turn-based rpg at its core and it got waifus! 8/10 ""rate up is a lie."" Saving for (your fav servant)"
"Great for passing time while commuting to and from work. Story starts off with a pretty simple save-the-world premise but eventually ramps up into something more solid. Its great for returning fans of the franchise but also not bad for players entirely new to Fate. You can pretty much complete all content without paying too! (Waifus and Husbandos will cost you a pretty penny, but not content completion.)"
Anime :|
Typical battle style with some random story
My favorite gatcha game rn! Never thought it would pass Bleach Brave Souls but it did. Only problem is my money often goes to it but that's my fault XD
"It's been a year since I've started playing this and though I've tried playing other games, this one is still the best so far. Story, art and the characters are much better than other games I've played. I've never lasted more than a month in a game and that says a lot."
"Free to play player with over 20+SSRS. Watch out for salty reviews who hate the game just becuz they are down on thier luck in a game u can beat with 3 star units, hell even with my ex+ luck i still level up amazing 3 stars like arash,okada,ushiwakamaru,Von hoeinheim and even below like Hans and i have waver since his first banner and i still use those 2. Stop being salty babys and level up the Cu/herc that literally wont die."
Gacha Hell.
Its okie :3
"Good side: Fun. Game mechanics is very simple. Stories can be entertaining and pretty good if you have idle time. The best part is that even a low rarity servant can be very strong and useful when compared to other games. Bad side: Gacha is literal hell. If you get lucky, you're lucky. If not, you're not. Endure the salt. Events can be very grindy. Material farming is a nightmare too."
"Aside from hard to get Heroic Spirits and hard to get Ascension Materials, this game was great unlike the other games that filled with pay to win players, this game was friendly towards the Free to play players like me. I would like to increase the drop rates for Ascension Materials that's all"
600 days. Still playing.
"As a gacha games this could be considered ""evil"" however Fate GO has a lot to offer in its stories and (now) beautify animated characters and attacks. I've heard this isn't a really ""2016-2020"" looking game, but I think that its okay as Fate go has way more to offer than some of ther others gacha games on the market. After all it is a mobile game so it does still suffer from grinding and RNG but if you can get passed that this game will keep you up playing it all night!"
"No matter how salty I feel for not getting enough SSRs, I can't deny how this game grew so much on me. I got really attached to my servants, the story is awesome too! FGO makes me cry and smile at the same time. Happy 3rd anniversary."
Love the servants and how theyre are so many singularities.also graphics are goodüòä
Rate Up is a Lie
skadi üíú
Bad gacha good gameplay
"Good storyline but the gacha is bad civilization. I'll update this review to 5* if I manage to get Skadi-sama this July. Edit*, I didn't get her -.-"
Had to edit my review since I'm enjoying it right now have no problems whatsoever
"Best RPG i ever played, I don't know what to say, yes salt is real but that feeling when you get something paid it off. Pls DW put Muramasa as a servant."
Its got Waifus.
Pls give skadi XD
"Good game but tends to get really slow during loading and transition. It's also irritating you can't skip event transitions. Edit: since the last main update, the slow loading issue is fixed. Now 5/5."
"As unforgiving the gacha could be, FGO is still a standardbearer of quality gacha games. The daily pull is not from the standard pull (FP pool), but there are servants you could get from completing each singularity AND event stories. Its not P2W though, play smartly and you could finish the entire storyline using just 3 stars. My qualm is mat grinds though, the drop rate is just brutal at times unless ypu get to higher levels (looking at you Phoenix feathers). All in all, good waifu game."
I like the game it's so fun
"Very cool, Need hentai VN soon"
Awesome. Period.
Waifus ftw
"At first you might think it's another mobile game cash grab but, in fact dedicated players *can* get the same benefits as people who play. The story is involved and not a hackney'd hokey story. It makes you love the various servants that you meet and makes you question the concept of good and evil by the second story arc's first chapter. You can see how much the developers put into expanding upon the Fate Franchise."
5 because I finally have SSR
"I hope you can develop a google account Registration, because not all can remember their numbers. Pls.. üò£üò£"
Absolutely love. If you'r a fan of the Fate franchise you'll probably like this game.
One of the more veteran friendly games out there. The game can be beaten on low rarity f2p units. While 5* and 4* rates are terrible if you do manage to roll the one you want they are relevant no matter when you started. This is the only gacha game I know of that provides ways to strengthen f2p units.
"As the fan of fate series, this game is really great. Not just expanding my knowledge in Nasuverse, the story also is a masterpiece. Playing and discussing about the game with friends make it more fun to play. Overall, this is best gacha game I've ever play."
"actually good game i don't understand why people complain about not getting the units they want even though the low rarity units can basically carry you towards the game. Some of the events in game are not that great but some are exceptional. Story itself is the best out of all the gacha games i played in my opinion, there is no game that has made me so excited about the continuation of the story in Fate/Grand Order"
minus one star cuz i didn't get jeanne d arc '3' jk
Ok want to play but it will not open on my galaxy s8. What a disappointment.
every day until tsuki remake comes out
"Combat is simple, art is mediocre, gameplay as a whole is boring, writing is bad, story is decent, monetization is absurdly expensive. I would not recommend this game to anyone."
"gacha rate horribly low, if you want to play like event mode, gonna have to finish alot lf stages üëé"
Read up on the basic game mechanics before going in blind.
Welcome to gacha hell ;)
Love the game but the grind is some times a pain in the neck. The sign in bonus is my only hope some times. But as is life its still a good game the summon mechanic is luck and i have bad luck when it comes to like i really want saber alter but i just cant get her no mater if i have 90 Quartz or 30 i cant even get a 4 star some times. On a multi summon! And i have tried since i started the game.
SKADI-SAMA pls <3
"This may sound crazy to some of you but this game is not at all pay to win. There is an option to buy things, however there is no possible way to use money to skip the grind to level up your characters. The game is also balanced around the F2P characters, so ultimately when you roll it isn't because the character is the best. You roll because you like that character, and you're paying for your waifus or husbandos, NOT for the best characters."
"I've been playing Fate for over a year now and let me just say this is my favorite mobile game of all time the story is excellent and engaging, the character sprites look really good, the events are also fun,the characters are also all good in their own different ways, and the music is also great,while the Gacha system feels unfair sometimes this is still understandable since most Gacha/Gacha like games tend to have similar rate ups for example kof all star, dokkan battle, and arknights"
For new players be warned there will be a lot of catch up. Unfortunately the game is getting more and more to point of locking new players out of current event content if you do not have certain more recent chapters complete. You can still roll gatcha banners but thats it. The games item drop rates and event store item acquisitions are excruciatingly tedious for both (Best events in my opinion were first Halloween / Christmas). Sadly in many cases the game does not feel rewarding for the effort.
"Okay so since Android 10 I have not been able to start up the game, and yano im kind of annoyed that they haven't fixed it yet! WYYY?! üò¢ past/pressent thx for fixing it!"
"I spent $5000+ SGD on pixels, that should pretty much explain the game by far. Astolfo NP 5 REEEEEEEEEEE"
The Games was so time consuming because of slow loading at the same time data consuming.
Salty rolls
I love this game it is so much fun and I think it's the best fighting game on the market.
Absolutely wonderful story and easy to grasp gameplay.
"I love the game, the character, and the story asa nd overall I found myself playing this game for hours and hours but the one only thing I wish they'd do differently is the summoning system"
‚ù§ Jeanne
If you're a fan of Fate play this game.
I love fate but u twisted the story into something that isn't even viable to the show and u lost me when most of ur summons have to be with paid gems that u have to buy. It's ridiculous how games try to bankrupt u over nothing. (Paid) gems? Really I'm not spending $40 just to get 1 summon I want
"It's hell, but waifus are worth it"
Best game hands down
Gacha rate is hell. Lol
JAlter pls come home üò≠
"Excellent game overall. The SSR gatcha rate is low, but unlike other gatcha games, none of the units you get feel like filler, and often get upgrades to keep them relevant. Even the 1 star units can be built to be extremely powerful, and as much work is put into those Servants as SSR Servants. The main and event storylines are also well written, to the point where it feels at times more like a VN than a gatcha. Great music and voicework put it above all other games in the genre, in my opinion."
"Great game all around, especially for Fate fans. I just really wish that we can link our accounts instead of having to use transfer codes. It'll be a 5 otherwise."
"Its fate which is cool but the gameplay is sickeningly boring, and you can't even idle it since there's no auto battle. Like if you aren't gonna let people full idle like Azur Lane try and make gameplay kinda interesting like FeH. FGO just boils down to pushing the red button with Mr. Merlin. Its completely devoid of thought in the gameplay. I will never understand people that say it takes strategy. Its literally pick merlin and red button with a defensive character even on the hardest events."
Good game. Interesting lore. I'm a fan of shisou got both shisou and skadi at np5 and shisou assassin welfare too . Thank you for the good rates
Love the game love the updates just wish they'd stop playing with the American version and give us all the updates the Japanese version gets overall love it tho
They not gave me ather thats a bug!
"Just because you gave me a Skadi, you think you deserve 1 more star in this review? No. I still want Tamamo no Caster. Rate up. Is still a lie."
"FGO has consumed my life... Pretty good game, 4/5."
"One of the best mobile games on the market characters are amazing and graphics are good and the gacha rates are good better that most games . This is a Tier 1 gacha game if you dont have this game downloaded, why ? Download it Now !"
Stupid game I bought 1048582 sq and it didn't give it to me I also had like 5953 summoner tickets and it got removed from my account i also had a bunch of characters and they got removed üò§üò§üò§ 0/10
Fun and a great way to introduce people to the nasuverse. The 5 stars are for the skadi
GOT SKADI 3 SQ BEST GAME EVER
"I lost my entire account because of a transfer issue, several times I have had to restart, please add a secure way to link our profiles, its disrespectful to the players who have lost their accounts and no longer have any chance of getting them back. Though I doubt its possible, I would really like my account back some day, it was very highly developed."
Perfect!
"It's a great game, keep trying to collect the servants class and finishing the story."
900 sq NO SKADI
I only keep it around for the characters and fate series lore
I love it with the whole events and stuff but everytime I try to summon a servant they don't show the servants that is summon and when enhancement of the servant it won't load please fix that bug.
Took so long to load.
"The story is amazing for a gacha game and really immerses you with its visual novel style. You even grow to love characters whose designs maybe deterred you from developing them in your roster in the first place. While the gacha rates are pretty intimidating, there's still enough love in the game to warrant a F2P casual playthrough. This is a polished gacha title that has some quality of life issues (no AFK-friendly grind mechanics) but a lot of heart."
This game is amazing!
one of the best mobile games ever
Good Civ
Gacha rate up for despair player
"Gacha rates? One of the worst admittedly but that just makes getting a SSR all that more satisfying. One of the redeeming features of this game is how f2p it is and how generous it is to new players. You don't have to spend a cent in this game to tackle any content they throw at you. Another plus is that after a the first few chapters the game is basically a high quality VN. All in all, a very fun and enjoyable game when you're not salty or in material hell. Which is.. 95% of the time."
Y is this game not available in other countries?
This game is free to play. And it is fun for the first few missions until it gets progressively more difficult. Some missions are impossible for me despite being higher than the recommended level. Not to say this game is garbage but the gacha pull rate is....I dunno rigged? I've played for a few months now & haven't pulled a Saber class until today because I paid for some quartz. And even then it was not a very good Saber servant. Refund me!! Rating this 1/5 is generous. Should have been 0/5.
"Ok well I found out I have nearly 400 hours on this game which is a bit embarrassing considering I've always considered myself a casual. After playing many other gacha styles games, FGO is more generous and playable than most out there. You can get plenty free content and the gameplay stays interesting. I do play to get my favorite characters (i was a fate fan even before) and have spent money on this game. Also some of the singularities are VERY BORING, very anime writing and fanservice"
My luck with summons is next to none but the best part is you don't have to spend money to obtain more SQ (in game currency) just a lil grind and you can save a ton!
It's pretty good.
‚ù§
"Great storyline, funny if repetitive events, and lots of prayer for gacha. Have been playing this game for 3 years and honestly, it's well worth the time (and tears). Probably the best storytelling mobile RPG I've played outside Chrono series and Another Eden"
i like the it
"Its all about the waifus... But there are still bugs that needs to be fixed like when the match started, all servants when casting their noble phantasms are not doing very well. They are not talking at ALL. But when they are hit, they talk even when selecting their skill they also talk. The only thing is that when using their noble phantasm they are not talking at all even the enemy. No subs too. HELP"
"When i was busy playing the game, at first it is playing very smoothly like my phone has 8 gb of ram so theres should be no problem playing this.. But a few hours later when my servants are using their noble phantasms, they are not saying or talking a single word at all even their subtitles are not there but when they are hit, they talk even when the game started or the match started they are all talking. Even the opponent or the enemy is not talking at all when doing their noble phantasms. Help"
It's alright I guess Edit 1 : 8/7/2020 well I certainly didnt think I'd stick around playing this game for so long. The gacha is a real pain in the ass because the game hands out quartz so few and far between so I'm stuck saving for months on end to roll a specific servant I want. There's a 2 year gap between the jp version and na version but that lets me plan out better on what servants i really want so thats good I guess. The salt from gacha aside I love everything else about this game.
"Great story marred by extremely predatory design, gacha rates are terrible. Limited time events with short deadlines and ""never miss a day"" login bonuses make making mistakes both easy and costly."
POG
"Been playing this since last year, everything is good. You don't have to have 4* or 5* Servants in order to clear the game. And the storyline is just so amazing as a whole."
Good game the gem and summoning is kinda scummy the only way to summon on the anniversary banners is to buy gems gems earned by free to play won't let you summon with that
I will say it is a very fun game with an amazing story line. Also the graphics and events are really fun. Though I do feel like there isn't enough events for newer players.
The best game ever.im looking forward to more updates on this game
10/10 would sell my house for a .jpeg again
"Game is very pretty, has many likeable characters, and cool strategic options. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that many events are completely un-fun, and the gacha rates are terrible."
If your a fate fan this game is awesome!
I've played this game for almost 2 years and just lost everything. Somehow my game got reset and lost all my progress. No way to recover it üò´. Will no longer be playing this game.
"Hmmmm, loading times aren't sluggish anymore, the game is impressing me more than usual üëåüèª"
I hate this game. 5 stars!
It's fun but it gets boring once you play for a little longer.
The worst mobile game surviving by piggybacking on franchise
"As of updating to android 10, the game crashes opon opening, but before then, it was a quite enjoyable game"
"Edit: Turns out that the game doesn't like USB Debugging being on. Once I turned that off. It launched fine. It's pretty fun, however, it's very much a gacha in the sense that it encourages you to buy summons... I keep trying to download and play this game but the game won't open. First it was asking me to open it using PayPal or other unrelated apps. Now it is trying to launch but then crashing immediately. Someone fix this please."
Love the game wish there were did more co-op function
"I have enjoyed the game since the Japanese release fun game good graphics 
good story. Only gripes are translation based which can be summed up in the 
below statement. Had to actually burn my saber because I hated seeing the 
horrible translated name altria instead of the nearly universally accepted 
Artoria or arturia that has been more or less used for about 10 years now 
heck fate Extella had an official translation of the name and this game was 
like nah it's Altria. Altria isn't even a name i mean really it just sounds 
like a Pok√©mon. Other than the translation complaint though nice work 
bringing the game over. Take the previous comment as a partial joke it's 
just in my opinion a bad translation the game itself is great. Update:. The 
game is rolling out slower than many other countries versions and giving 
less compensation."
The drop rate is a lie don't trust it
Interesting combat system. Wish certin materials were a little more acsesable.
Too many currencies and it just looks like a hyped up flash game. To create an event and divide the games main currency between paid and free is scummy you want people to invest time and money but then invalidate the time invested by doing that. if this game really makes billions you earn nothing favorable by doing this.
"Definitely for Fate-fans though i don't think people new in the series will understand the whole story without having a knowledge to the series, the game is fun! (and definitely gacha) fun..."
The best because been a Fate fan for a long time and love the story and events
I love the game but the RNG man. 960 SQ and 50 tickets. Not a single 5 star servant.
Perfect üòå
"Have been playing for almost 3 years,I can say that the game is really worth the time, with a fantastic story, loveable characters and pretty amazing fan services atleast for a mobile game .The gacha salt can be straight up cruel as hell sometimes but it's really satisfy when you got the servant you really want . Furthermore, the developers are really doing their best to keep the game going . In the end it's totally worth your time if you really love spend your money on gambling :>"
Thank you for the upgrade! So much faster now ‚ù§Ô∏è I love this world & game !
"It's a sure five star for me but dear developers, there is a bug in the new event that was released about the giant girl(Buyuan I think? No that's wrong but that event) upon reaching a certain section 3 of the last quest line. My game just freezes and I waited for a while but it didn't work. Can you do anything about it?"
"Dear developers of fate:go, Despite the story being FANTASTIC and the gameplay better than your autobattle farming, the big elephant is summon rates on banners. For example i pulled using 300 saint quarts and had only recieved 4* and 5* craft essences. I bring this up as the summon rate for servant to craft essence ratio is thrown off. 5* and 4* servants have a 1/4 ratio with 1* having a 1% total and 4* being 3%. An easy fix to the imbalance is guarantee a 4*+ servant for 10 pull plz fix this!!!"
This game is amazing by far one of the best mobile games I have rating 5 stars because it deserves it but my one complaint is the summon rates I wish they were higher but other than that I am quite satisfied with this game.
"I am a returning player, and the gacha system is A TOTAL SCAM 400 quartz all CE and get servant that not even in a banner? Not gonna bother anymore"
"The devs helped me recover the data I lost within a few days... Awesome support... Fun game, even if you've never seen the anime like me."
Good game but if I do go in expecting to get the hero you want this game is completely rng on characters even if you pay
"Great characters, good combat, not pay to win. Game has recently got a new engine which has improved the load times and overall performance"
The grind is real.
Too many lolis. Gacha system is garbage compared to other games. If you're unlucky you could spend $1000 and never get a rare character. Other games at least have better odds or will give you a pity character after a number of pulls.
Best game. Ever.
"rate up is a lie, you're only going to play this game to get your waifus , it has an okay storyline, and you'll never get what you want unless you pay for it, the mechanics are pretty solid though"
Addicted to incridible story that is on par with visual novel and all chracter from 1 to 5 star is viable. There is no useless character on this game.
keep the good job
It's a nice game to play.
aside from the nasty gacha rate its a good game (probably)
Petition for a 5* give away pls
"Love this game, I love how persistent the updates are as well as the graphics... no joke this is my number one favorite game on Android and the only game that I would ever play üëäüòÉüíï"
The salt...
this game put me in to a crippling drepression and i lost every thing 1 star
"Amazing story, have lots of fun with this game"
This game has the best story out of all gacha games I've played!
Idk good
"I did not spend a thing in the game but I was still able to get through all of those challenge quests. This game definitely deserves a 5 star! Though I admit that the gacha may be cruel for others, you can more or less win every quests with any Servants that you like. The meta Servants may be much better than others but keep in mind that the meta is not really the important factor in going through the game. Play with the Servants that you like and you are good to go."
Loving this game just wish it was easier to get certain heroes
"one of the best mobile games ive played story wise. mechanically wise, it brings new kind of rpg system for me and its just nice. The gacha is plainly hell, however each servants have their own uses, which makes it great for poor players like me."
I hope the game will catch up to the Japanese version. The events are nice because of the welfare servants and materials. The story is nice too.
"It's going to be fun for any fans of the Fate series. The characters are larger than life and the storylines are both humorous and intense equally. The only complaint from me is very common for these games. The good rewards and best gatchas are hard to get. It can be frustrating to save up the necessary currency to attempt a good draw but too often the result is less than hoped for. Usually, unless you spend real money, you might only get one or two full ten item draws in each story."
"Difficult for those who want to rush through the game. Very good game for playing over the course of a year, for free. Prepare for the grind!"
"Most awesome,wonderful and amazing, but I ended up with no servant support for defense and buff to progress."
I've wasted more than $5000 on this game. Probably would do it again tbh..
Been able to play it now and am enjoying the life along with it's story.
"I was really enjoying this game. The story is awesome and I enjoy all of the Fate series in general, but when I installed the most recent update, the app kept crashing. I sent an error report, but there was no response. I completely uninstalled the app and reinstalled it with no results. I hope eventually I will be able to continue playing this game. It is a great mobile game as long as it works on your phone. Update: I fixed it! Had to turn off usb defrag. Apparently it's an android thing."
The amount of salt I've gathered while playing this game can give Don Juan Pond a run for it's money.
nice.
"Addictive, involvef content, don't need to spend a fortune"
The rates are a scam!!!
It's fine I guess if you like the fate story and stuff but if you're looking to get ANYTHING good from the gacha then I advise those without a lot of disposable income to search elsewhere. The chance of getting anything 5 star is so incredibly low and made worse by craft essence bull.
Great game and the matnence is worth it
Great game the story gets good at chapter 6
That's (gacha) Hell you're walking into.
"It's a fun game, I just wish there weren't so many updates... like every day. Can't they just do that weekly instead?"
Best mobile game ever
Grailed Astolfo 10/10
Ballz Deep!!!!
SKADI-SAMA!!!!!!!!!!!
best
Game is great! As long as you dont buy saint quartz it doest cost a thing. The strategy and graphics are wonderfully rendered. Nothing beats the feeling when you get a five star servant. Fully reccomend.
One of thr best gacha games <3
"Needs more engaging, in combat mechanics. The grind doesn't have to be painful."
"After three years, I have enjoyed playing the game. The events have been fun, along with a lot of content and updates to mirror the Japanese version. The only takeaway is that the free to play rolls are hard to net SSR characters as the chances are slim, even by Gatcha games standards."
Extremely hard to get 5 stars without the usage of money.
If you're a fan of fate it's pretty nice. It would have been 5 stars if not for the hell that is the gacha.
If only the drop rate of 5 stars were higher üò©
"Fun and while annoying it is possible to play/progress as a free player. The story is very good (despite some very stupid plot holes and moments, discounting genuine comedic stories). I like the Visual Novel aspect of this story the most but gameplay isn't bad either."
Good game it's f2p friendly
Get me outta this gacha Hell
It's decent at best. Drop rates are piss poor but for a gacha game I suppose it is to be expected. Don't waste your money buying saint quartz it is just a waste
This game is addictive
I love this game so much.
It'll suck the soul out of you but that's what you weebs want.
Literally the best way to throw away spare money and time
The only Gacha Story game I have time for. Mmmm gacha
"The only thing I have a problem with is the difficulty in finding the support that I want to use. I understand thay they can't all be displayed at once but I hope it was easier to cycle through your friends list. Otherwise, I enjoy the game very much."
I enjoy tje game very much abd the story is very good. Please release Muramasa soon.
One of the best game out there.
Nothing else to say... But amazing!
"Very fun app. I've been enjoying the story, art, and gameplay for over 2 years."
"Really funny, story is great and before you know it you're shelling out money for a PNG of your favorite character. Rolled Gilgamesh so 5/5."
Waifu/Husbandu Simulator. Low summon percentage. Decent story. Watch the anime. Consumed by the gacha.
"giving this game 5 star so that i can get a 5 star back :,)"
I had to mortgage my house for Jeanne Alter and I do not regret it
"I really like salem, babylonia and shimosa story. Its a nice game. You must play it if you like fate. One more thing, DW please do collaboration with something out of typemoon franchise. Like nier automata or touken ranbu maybe? Sorry if my english is bad. But overall this is a good game"
Love the mythology behind every character and interactions between each of them also doesn't really Express pay to win so that's another plus I wished I got on sooner but I hope I get gilgamesh soon keep up the good work
Get me out of here
Its fgo. The grand daddy of gachas. Leave your salt about not getting your waifu aside for a sec and appreciate the great storytelling which is such a rarity in gachas nowadays
It finally worked for me
Great game for casual players like me. Doesn't require much time when you get the hang of it. The gacha is salty but you can still complete quests without the optimal/meta servants.
Best game ever totaly love the game
Gacha hell but it's so good
"Needs to catch up with JP much more quickly Otherwise, 4 stars for gameplay and story"
"During the past 2 years, I've been playing FGO daily. As a f2p, gacha is not evil to me. Just save up for the waifu/husbando you want or if it's gameplay you want, then go ahead. No one's stopping you from getting that png character. Unless you run out of quartz Edit: Thanks for the QOL updates"
Such an amazing story and characters are so amazing
It ruined my life
"It is unacceptable to have an app be able to be downloaded on a device that apparently cannot run it. Instead, it opens with an email to send to support. Nope."
"It's a ridiculous fate franchise conglomerate of everything that fate is involved in. If you like fate play it. If you like to play free to play in gatcha games you can do it, with trouble but can do it with lots of how to's online to help."
"Great gacha game with good storyline. I played for the gameplay, stayed for the waifus."
"The game is wonderful, probably the most addicting game I played for me. The history and literature references are also educative, altho not the most accurate but it introduces me to new historical figures I never knew before. The graphics is so good. And the gameplay is just the best."
"Amazing game with top tier waifus and solid classic turn based RPG gameplay. The story is very engaging, and the characters as compelling as they are coolly designed."
They finally updated it and im satisfied.
"It's a fun game if you like the fate series, excellent time killer ."
Best gacha ever (if ssr chanves are up :<)
"Don't let bad reviews that mainly just complain about the gacha rates dissuade you, the game is well worth anyone's investment, who loves a good story. Gacha in this game may be cruel at times, but you can beat any part of this game with almost any servants if you really want to. If you still really want to try the rarest servants, the many players (whales) like me are always willing to share them on our friends lists."
"Started this game since I'm a big fan of the Fate franchise. Did not expect the storyline to be this good... Came for the waifus, stayed for the story!"
Looking forward to Skadi
Looking forward for Skadi
This game is good but the art and animations did not age well.
"This game has the best storyline over any other mobile games. I play it mainly for the plot and the characters. The gameplay requires you to plan ahead and think strategically in most challenge quests. The grind is not really hard and time-consuming compared to some other gacha games. However, the gacha RNG is abysmal and you will never have enough quartz to roll for your waifu. The silver lining is that you could learn to enjoy the little things and have fun getting unexpected SSR spooking you"
Sorry if I give only 1 star its because before you play this game you need to download the data on this game and require 700+ MB to download it plss fix it
ive spent over 25 hours in this so far and i have no complaints the graphics are great it runs smooth and it plays fair
One of the best gacha because it doesnt feel like you're pressured into spending or grinding and has great character development for servants of all rarities
I Use To Love This Game But Sometimes There's a Problem with connection The Gacha Rate Up Is A Bit Dissapointing yet very exciting
Lol. Incredible ga cha game
I'm here forever now
Eh it's ok yish
"You honestly don't have to pay a single thing to play this game, and I may not be the most seasoned ""Master"" but I am happy with the number of Servants that I do have, and I have never paid a single thing. There is so much a F2P player can take advantage of like the daily ticket exchange, which gives an option of 1 out of 3 mats that would help anyone. Then there's the monthly Summoning tickets and the XP cards that you can get from the shop... So try to have fun I guess, it's not hard."
I love it It has many of my favorite servants and good story to
"love this game, thanks for the FATE inside experience"
A very fun game to play!
Favorite game on my phone so far
"Great game, I think it is the only free gacha game that actually cares about its players, you don't even need the best servants in the game to beat it!"
I'm Back Cause I Support Plushie
"Fgo is one of the best gacha on the ""market"" they give out their gacha currency like oprah gives out cars. The animations are some of the best mobile games have to offer and the story and characters are really original and they are fantastic. Its pulling system is either hit or miss sometimes you waste 120 sq other times you get an SSR from a single pull. One last thing be prepared to grind all day and night in this game but trust me its worth it."
Perfection
Hope you guys fix the loading Issues cause it takes to much time to start the battle abd to open other commands
"This company has done NOTHING to update this game into 2020. The loading screens will drive you MAD, the same mundane progression AND event grind from when the game was first released is STILL here, the gacha is still the worst I've EVER seen (hundreds of heroes that can ONLY be summoned on their specific banners on top of garbage rates), basic quality of life features are still missing, and the company didn't give players even ONE free multi for their ANNIVERSARY. So sad."
Its very F2P Friendly the 3 stars though hard to get in the F2P gacha can easily beat the final boss people even make videos with low rairity servants beating hard bosses and yes these droprates can be a little cancerous lookin at you hearts of the forein god but that just means your patience will be more rewarding even the premium currency saint quarts can only get more shiny units that you will need to grind for more rare and exotic items that cannot be bought from some sort of shop
Super fun and addicting game.
I love it 10/10
"Anyone who says that the game is pay to win is absolutely wrong. I never had trouble as a f2p player during both the campaign, farming and CQ's and if I did it was probably because I wasn't using the right team comp for the battle. The 1 to 3 stars are just as good and sometimes are alot better and are clear cut top tier in their respective roles. You won't always need a Waver or a Merlin to enjoy and play the game. All you need is brainpower and skill to utilize each servant to the fullest."
It is vey fun to paly the game.
Even though i am salty af about the character rates this game is Awesome. Keep doing wat u are doing üëçüëç
Best story for a mobile game
Great game. Really deep story when you get past the slow beginning. Rate ups are a lie though
Gimme okita alter
"For people starting with FGO as their introduction for the Fate series,it can be confusing to them when compared to starting with the Fate/Stay Night LN.It is F2P with its lower rarity characters being better farmers/main DPS/Support compared to some of the higher rarity characters like Cu Chulainn and Mozart.The story can be deep and fascinating later on at the London singularity,but the first few singularities don't have that deep of a storyline.It gets difficult at camelot,but it can be beat."
The most addictive game I've ever played in my entire life.
The best mobile game of all time.
"Since the QOL update, this game is flawless. Runs perfectly now with no hangups. Totally smooth. One of the most popular gachas for a reason."
"- Story is great. - Characters feel close thanks to their individual stories backing them up. - Gacha is cruel indeed, but I also feel immense enjoyment after pulling someone i want. - gameplay is soso(i personally enjoy it, especially like to see those big daddy crit numbers and doing those np loops). Overall I'll give it a solid 9/10 since i enjoy playing it so very much."
"Awful game: no auto play, no new players reward, fighting animation is outdated, and main characters are weird/cheesy as hell (senpai). Don't bother with this game, there are so many better games out there."
"The in-game mechanics and the combat system are phenomenal, my only dislike is that I cannot link my FGO game data to my account which means I have to resort to issuing transfer codes every single time I want to login on a different device. Beware of this because if you forgot to issue a newer transfer code and your phone breaks then you're basically screwed, you'll have to contact them with details about your account and it's not guaranteed that you will even get your account back."
Great game if you can manage your resources
V e r y n i c e.
"This by far is the only Gacha game that you will actually enjoy by the story and gameplay, however it gets a better context if you know your Nasuverse basics, and the gacha certainly could be a bit more forgiving, since High value servants are by far the hardest ones to obtain In all of Gacha Hells. Gameplay wise, is as basic as an RPG game can be, but certainly has a lot of mechanics that you learn along the way that makes the game more fun when you try more combinations."
I'm a masochist.
I just waisted a lot of money for a jpeg
Its a fun game and fun to play
"BEST STORIES,SIMPLE GAMEPLAY,NO RAIDS OR GUILD THING AND RANKED THING, the only down side is the horrible rate and repetitive gameplay. For new player just think that this game is visual novel with a spice that is simple rpg battle and you will enjoy it."
"Game is awesome from the art to the story to the game play. Now the gatcha rates are terrible no help in increasing odds on getting the unit you want or any decent 5 star unit. Spent 100 to test the rates and not one single 5 star servant in any of the pulls. With the support system there is no need to have your own good units, fun free to play game just don't expect to get the character you want."
Recently returned to the game. The game is great now. So many Qol updates. Recently they updated the platform to make the game go fast and smoothe without any lag. Fun casual game to play.
"The game is much faster now due to the update. I've been playing for around 2 years now and I've enjoyed my experience a lot. Just finished Lostbelt 2 myself. However, I wish they'd increase the chance of getting an SSR."
"Bad rates, annoying tutuorial, and bad start for new players. Also pay to win."
This Game Is Fun ü§©
Best game I've ever played
Please fix the loading time it's so long
"You save up your gacha pull currency(the one worth anything anyway) all day. You wait weeks for a decent gacha that actually has some units you want. Guess what you get, some dirt five star craft essence you don't need nor want, And will probably never use as long as you play the game. Lord forbid the craft essence be something other than a duplicate."
Drop rates for 4 or 5-star characters suck don't waste your money or time
"As a 'totally' unbiased fate fan, I think this is one of the best gacha games out there. The story is pretty decent if you don't mind the first few singularities, which honestly are pretty bad. Fgo is also quite f2p friendly and you can clear everything with relative ease even with free units along with the friend support system. Been playing for a couple months now and I've been enjoying the game quite a lot and with the recent engine update the game got a whole lot better. 8/10"
Even when this game always gives me heartbreaking results. I still can't let you go. You're like a drug man.
Get rid of that p.o.s. selection support option(s.s.o.) b.s. just scrap the it all I hate it and always will even if it small portion just scrap it and to those who think oh that s.s.o idea is a good news flash it is not and it never well be to me it's like treating a fully capable of taking care of themselves 40 year old as 4 year old who know Jack squat and consently need supervising. My point is just give the new player the tutorial and then end it none this s.s.o. b.s.
Too grindy.
"4th time reviewing this game. Summon rates are terrible. Having to constantly skip dozens of banners to save up enough sq to have a chance at getting a character I like is a living hell, it's not even remotely fun. Even as a daily player, you never get enough sq. All this game wants is your money. If you plan to be a f2p, STAY AWAY; this game doesn't care about the f2p fanbase and only wants money. I actually want to kill myself over this game sometimes. How pathetic is that?"
"It's Amazing, that's it, that's the review."
"playing this game for 3 years now and I still dont get bored with it, only saltiness haha very good story as expected from nasuverse"
"My favorite game, Not Reccomended"
"Broken update only caused more isues than it ""fixed"". Constantly freezes up with sounds still playing as normal. My phone I'm using came out this year."
"Story: great / Gameplay: nice (pls enable np animation skip, I'm begging) / UI: great / Art: amazing / Gacha: this is hell, don't do it"
The updates really improved the app! No more lags while playing.
"Will change to 5* once engine update comes. As of now, more time is spent in loading screens than 3-turning a quest"
"I love the game, it was recommended to me by a friend, and in all honesty I really enjoyed it, all the really iconic characters and the gameplay, I hope it keeps up. I also have one suggestion that I wish is added to the game, it is that you'd be able to give/send Saint Quartz to your friends, the limit would be 30 quartz each day, I'd like to add this feature so I can thank my friend and send him some quartz as my gratitude."
"Been playing since launch and this game has improved so much over the years. From menu navigation to the battle system this game has made huge strides for a better experience. The story is accessable enough for new entrants into Fate, but has enough references for long time fans. Only thing preventing this game from being 5 stars is the abysmal gacha."
"Even though its a heavy grind gacha game, its story and anime is intriguing and its animations are cool too."
"I think the cutscenes are too long, the tutorial doesn't tell you too much, liked the anime a bit but the game I just dont."
"Cursed Gacha game, staring at the banners give me ptsd of farming just to roll only to get no 4 stars"
The game lags too much!
"This game is a breath of fresh air compared to most complex rpg games, really enjoyed the simplicity of gameplay and also the character design. Also, being strictly free to play in this game isn't really bad as the game keeps on giving free stuffs."
"Story gets better, the lostbelt is a beast when it comes to storytelling. Im right now mostly playing it for the story its like a visual novel ffs. It gets hard too, dont underestimate low star servants."
My 2nd yr Anniversary of F/GO. Still loving it story wise and advance updates like 2.0 but.. The Legend of Heroes preoccupied my time playing because how Legendary of an JRPG the game is.
"takes too long to mute the music and sfx sounds. CANT get through the tutorial because the sounds are annoying and i try to watch youtube videos while playing these so i cant turn the media volume down. forced tutorials are annoying, but mix that with innability to access the settings until you complete them and it is completely abhorrent"
"No other mobile game has ever had me so gripped in its story. There's just something unbelievably epic about saving humanity with famous figures of our history beside us. The gacha is cruel, yes. And the grind is brutal. But for the past two years I've been playing, I can easily say that the highs and lows of the F/GO's story continues to take my breath away. I'll be playing this for a while yet."
"Elias is a bully for pulling the newest 5 star, >:("
Pretty gay ngl
All in all I really like this game. You run out of AP points extremely fast at higher levels and if you're not careful it can cost you a small fortune to recharge your AP points. I must add that the Auto recharging of AP points is nice but I can't sit around all day waiting for that to happen to continue playing the game. I need to add their are alot of technical issues. The current statesman quest can't even be completed. These guys either deleted or sold my account.
"Decent, the amount of depth in team builds is good-ish other than about 85% of the servants are either useless or outdone by the current meta. Every chapter aside from the intro and last chapter are useless/negligible in regards to story. Some missions are long and tiring. Grind is boring, needs more things to make mundane things like EXP or material grind short. Skip tickets would be phenomenal. If it weren't for the horny people whaling for this game, probably would've died a long time ago."
Need actual engine update.
This is a rabbit hole I cant help but fall into. I couldn't stop even if I wanted to. And I'm okay with that.
"I've been playing this game for a few years now. I like how I can still enjoy the content with free event and 3* characters. You can always borrow friends' servants if you dont. What keeps me playing is the engaging storyline, one of the best I've seen from a mobile game, and even some AAA games. Borderlands 3, looking at you!"
Very fun game and no need to 'pay to win'
Janky dialogue interface and fighting mechanics bland
Bad gacha rate is bad civilization
10/10 guaranteed to make you go broke.
Awsome game but can you add the ability to trade servants with other people is that possible
Great but wish it had a function to trade servants between friends
I just watched Gigguk rate this game so I downloaded it..
one word: G A C H A
"It's a great story, but dont hope to get your favorite characters ever unless you save for months or spend money on .jpeg women to complete content"
Thank you for the help! Play again!
God bless the engine update üôè
Paid up too much damn money for a photo of a girl
Thanks for optimizingg
"I honestly don't know what the game is like, whenever I go on, the servers are either down for maintenance or I need to update my game"
The game is cool but if don't spend money on it you will get no were in the game an less you want 3 star character which in every summon and that not the worse part with every summon you will always get a craft essence 4 or 5 so getting a character is like 1 in a trillion chances to get the character you want or even just to get a good character. The game need to lower the craft essence by alot and raise the chance to get a character or make it easier for player which as been playing for year
Try adding auto battle for farming. I won't even talk about the rate up...
"Gib meh free SQs UwU Ok seriously, The game has a very low chance to get a 5*, but it compensates it by being a FTP Friendly, Even a Free to Play Player can sometimes get a 5 star."
I love this game but drop rates are crazy low
"Is definitely a fun game and as much as gacha rates are complained about, dont really see an issue as its hard not to roll servants every now and then. Even without rolling said servants, you can roll for 1-3*s daily which aren't really worse than 4-5*s outside of base stats due to lower levels. The gameplay itself is pretty unique vs other mobile games you see around and am kind of disappointed we don't see more games using it. Still waiting for tsukihime collab"
"Very good, alot of improvement. Now i can play it."
Best game but fix the gacha rate please
Thanks for early engine update DW
"Story and characters are great, but don't come into this game expecting to summon the better units easily. The gacha rate is brutally low and rate up is a lie."
"It's a fun game just don't spend money often, maybe once here and there but be careful. Story is good üëå"
I've been playing the game for over 2 years now. If you're a fan of the fate series it's definitely a game worth checking out. The story is fun and the gameplay is engaging. The only reason I'm giving a four star review is that the loading times take forever.
Rate-up is a lie
"The gameplay is very good and is balaced fantastically (For the most part), focusing more on strategy than brute strength. Even though the gacha rates are really bad, the game itself gives you a decent amount of gacha currency and is balanced around roles instead of specific characters."
"Let me start by saying, I'm very biased with my rating. I love FGO as a whole. If low rates and grinding for mats aren't your thing, it's best to avoid this game. If you can get past that, the story and characters are wonderful."
It's what it seems
love this game so much
"One of the WORST Gacha rates I have ever experienced in ANY game. But it's got a great story, the art is fantastic, and all in all it's a pretty good game."
Amazing game with all my favorite servants.
"I am a fan of Fate series, and I like to collect servants haha, the Gacha system is hurtful as always(makes me see the reality of whaling system) however the game is pretty good, with the original seiyuus on the characters--I'm fangirling over them. I even watch the FGO radio where they have seiyuus as guests."
"Good game, runs too slow to really play all the time but when you do you really enjoy it"
Love this game.. just remember slow and steady wins you stuff..
"It alright. It got waifus, that's it. It's rates for Five Stars are hot garbage though."
Fun gameplay that hasn't pressured me into feeling like I need to spend money to get a good experience.
Hell is fun
"Playing for about a week, its a great gacha game as long as you remember you have limited resources as a fp2 (unless you're not). But what got me hooked was the story, and i hope they continue to develop games with stories like fgo"
"probably one of the best games I've played on my phone. The fact I can play and beat everything with just the basic servants really makes me feel like I can beat any encounter with proper planning. I also quite enjoy that there is no pay to win, and it doesn't constantly try to get into your wallet with constant ""deals"" either. My only complaint is that the grind for materials can be a bit much. Overall I am really happy with this game."
My game crashes always
"Best mobile game ever played, the story quality is above other mobile games by leaps and bounds, there's a reason this game is the most popular game in Japan."
This is a great game. The only real issue is the abysmal drop rates for servants for the gacha
Good game very nice JPEGs
I LOVE FATE SERIES
Love the game but almost impossible to get 5 star heroes if you dont spend money.
One of the best I've ever played
Great game for sure
"The recent update won't let me get into the game. Whenever I tap the title screen to continue, it just loads and turn entirely into a white screen. Fix this and I will change back to 5 stars."
RIP your wallet.
10/10 would eat Udon noodles out of Holy objects again.
Good sheet... Hope you can increase the drop rate tho...
"Great Gacha game, but 4 star for haven't buff Artoria Saber!!! All Hail the Penguin King Almighty!!!"
I have been playing this for nearly 2 years now. It sucks that I'm not a day 1 player and that I lost my account twice (completely my fault). I stayed and came back for the awesome story and the probability of meeting great characters. I enjoyed all the events so far and I think I'm gonna continue playing for years to come.
"I started this game as a test of will, to see how long it would take me to crack and spend money on a gacha game. What I got was an enjoyable game, and a step into a great series (though I recommend experiencing the other media first). The developers have lovingly improved this game as the story continues, and I have never seen a patch note I didn't like. Though the usual rates still dissuade me from spending, I'm no longer bothered by the idea of dropping money on this. Cheers."
I like the story but the summon rates need some work on. It's so worth it when you get a 5 star.
Great game every thing works well and balanced it's just the 5star gatch rate iv got none so far and it sucks after spending about 350 quarts just take the 5 star rate and atlest make it a bit higher and I do understand why it's like this because you well wouldn't be worth 4billion bucks and dangling our extremely feminized versions of historical figures in front our faces is how you've done it
The summoning rate this game has enrages me. I just want at least one 4-5 servant per 30 saint roll. When i spend two weeks farming for 30 saint crystals and all of it being craft essence which no one want and 3-2 servents which i got multiple it makes me sad. Either seperate the crafting essence into another roll or change the summoning rates pls and the gameplay is a little stale. Well at least they have lots of events that give saint crystals and sometimes give free servant events.
Just finished solomon after a long while Here is my take on it So damn addicting with intresting gameplay Being can be played in both F2P and whaling And the character design itself has proven to me that it is worth my time sinking hundreds of hours in this
"The game is good but its to hard to get any good servants or get their ascension materials, sad"
"Once you download this, theres no going back #willpay$1000forapng"
Its good but the 1% of getting a 5 star servant really hurts when you dont even use money on games
Great game gacha needs work .
I love pouring hours and money into something that's destroying my social life. Sarcasm aside I do love the game.
Learn History thru FGO
Thanks for the freebies and updates
Dead summons rate üò¢
"This game draws you in through having a captivating storyline, and brilliant development of historical as well as well known fictional characters. It's possible to get everything you want in the game as long as you're willing to invest your time into the game and having great amounts of luck. It's not a typical play to win game as paying does not guarantee you have an advantage. My one complaint is the excess amount of farming needed to get materials to strengthen your characters."
"Gigguk inspired me to play this Unlike what I kept hearing about this game, it's not pay to win. I've been playing for 3 months and I have decent Servants. The Gacha Gods has been kind to me"
Im poor
"Edited from 1st review: So from my experience, the game is enjoyable though prone to mental exhaustness. There is a variety of characters to love, waifus and husbandos alike. The story for each singularity gets better, one of the game's charms. My main gripe to the game is probably its grindiness and cruel gacha rates. But, if you're a regular gacha player, these aspects of gacha games are their norms. All in all, fan of Nasuverse or not, you can immerse yourself in FGO"
"Has a best story, more grinding for materials & free saint quartz, unforgiving gatcha. Overall its a good game"
Git Gud Scrubs
The is a very good game.I wish there is more content and servants like the JP fgo.
It sucks.. Convert to Arknights instead..
"Welcome to gacha hell...Welp, still loving the game tho."
God Bless TWO
Do the engine update like on JP.xD Then we'll talk about the addittional 4 stars. Hahaha 10-29-2019 Lostbelt is here. Still no engine update. 4-10-2020 -yeah finally take the additional 4 stars! (6-23-2029)
I'm in too deep. Send help.
Thanks for the engine update. I hope the gameplay becomes smoother now.
Very F2P friendly (since you can do well without the SSR you won't be getting) :P
"FGO went from being handled at a mediocre level, to being truly exceptional right now. QoL updates are being pumped out to NA so fast that we are almost up to date with JP in terms of QoL. I love this game"
Amazing update for today!
"Amazing game with such good stories in the campaign that one has been made into an anime series (fate grand order Babylonia) and another into a movie (fate grand order Camelot). Not only that but the game has one of the most beautiful animations from Noble phantasms to the plethora of Waifus and husbandos. All around great game, but beware your credit card ü§£"
"Took my life away, wallet chan is crying"
Won't even launch.
Amazing game play and love the story as well
okita best waifu
The load times are ridiculously long. You spend more time waiting on any aspect of the game to load than play time
Good game...but the fact that you're limited in what you can do because of QP is...ridiculous. Wanna level up a servant? Fork it over. Wanna level up a Servants skills? More QP. I find it ridiculous that QP has to be used for something that's a basic part of an RPG.
My experience is based on what I played on JP version. Kind of abandoned this version after I started playing the JP version. WAY MORE FUN despite the language barrier.
Have been playing since launch
Wwe WWE
just give 1 star because why not. ;)
Is fun
"Rolling system in NA and JP is different, I easily get 6 SSR for 3 days in JP, a little bit of frustrating because even newbies can't get the SSR they wanted on event banners. A friend of mine wasted about 900+SQ, still can't get the SSR. You should be fair in the rolling system."
"Aside from the typical unforgiving and lying gacha rate-up system, the game itself is pretty good. Pretty much turn based card game. You will get free currency to roll for servants you want to help you build your team to beat story mode and bosses. It is F2P. You don't personally need 4/5* servants to beat bosses, game forces you to select a support so you can definitely get through. Also as long as you're leveling the right servants and their skills, you'll be good."
Running Android v10 and this won't fully install or run. Crashes instantly every time.
waifu simulator with epic story
It's fun and you get to have characters that voiced your favorite anime characters
Money go bye bye
"I dont know if it because of RAM issues, but currently the game runs incredibly slow since yesterday, i tried clearing cache and clearing space but no real changes. So next update could you guys perhaps fix that cause there are a couple others who have this issue currently."
Great Fate Game! There should also be a way to bind an account for reliable save progress. Energy regeneration should be 1 energy per 3min not 5min. It also has a problem when opening the app. It get stucks at loading screen so you have to click home then press the fgo app again for it to work.
"Absolutely loved it, Currently finished till prologue and there was never a time I didn't enjoy the battles of the Main Campaign. The game regularly adds events and keeps the thrill. Even tho the gacha rates are low, If you properly upgrade even the R characters, you can expect easy victories. My favorite Singularity is 6th, the battles felt challenging even though I had been playing for around 400 days and enjoying the events in the background. 100% recommended app, great story and gameplay."
"Forgot transfer info, is there another way to get my data back?"
It has a good interface
"As a 4 year veteran, the game play and the amount of synergy goes beyond what hou can imagine. Sure there will be ups and downs with the gacha system. I will admit it can be downright cruel... HOWEVER higher rarity isnt essentially better. You can achieve the same achievements like the Dolphins and whales, but at a slower pace. The game make you think like a game of chess and a bit of RNG is played into. Nonetheless, the most diverse game I've encounter and I do not regret playing after 4 yrs."
Can't update Holly Molly help me I love this game
"Love Gudako, Rate up is a lie and thank you support for carrying me. Would recommend, but remember everything in moderation especially gacha."
Interesting storyline and wide variety of characters to battle with make this a really enjoyable strategy game. The frequent events and content keep it interesting too. Plus it links together with other Fate lore in other shows and games.
Lostbelts are amazing!
Doesn't even open it crashes on start up for me
Best game ever i'm looking forward to updates!!
"Is rate up a lie or not a lie? That is the question: Wether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer, The slings and arrows of outrageous Saint quartz, Or to take arms against a sea of salt, And by opposing end them: to pay or remain free to play; No more; and by a payment, to say we end the heartache and thousand supernatural spooks, That wallet is heir to? 'Tis but a consummation Devoutly to be rolled. To roll, to save, To save, perchance to dream; aye, there's the waifu, For in that sleep of salt.."
"This game is pretty fun, the gameplay isn't complicated, and the character sprites and the card art are pretty nice too."
"ONE of the WORST gacha game I've ever played!!! The gacha rate 5 stars heroes are so LOW!!! And also even at FIRST 10X pull you cant even Get a guarantee 5-star Heroes only 4-star Heroes will get the most gacha pull You have!! F2P players like me Can't even win this kind of thing if you don't spend money in it!! Yes, the game is kinda Cool and awesome BUT the other System Sucks!! Even the Rewards are sucks... I will never Rate this game to 5 star cuz this game only needs MONEY not Game Experienc"
Keeps crashing on launch for sony xperia 1.
Fun time sink what more can you ask for . Stories are also cute
Keeps crashing. I can't even open it. Using Samsung S10+
An amazing game i just wish it could be more like the arcade version but otherwise a perfect game for people who like the fate series
how do i recover from an old profile if the game is deleted?
U gotta make the transfer easier to understand i lost my account again.
It doesn't give you the option to link your Google account in the game
"I love fate, but this gacha is killing me. I feel like I've woken up in a meat locker with saber punching money out of me."
After 1000+ days this game is S+ Tier I am loving this game. Please sponsor me playing this game Aniplex.
Fun enough to keep me playing for a couple hours. That gacha can be strait savage sometimes.
"The game is good, just put your time into it and it'll be great."
"Overall really great game, no bugs or stuff like that, great story, perfect balance in battles, grinding is kinda hard for lower levels but you can get there, the events that are going on really do add to the game, and voice acting is on point."
Best game to put me financially behind and is almost worth it if it means more fate!
Hello i recently got a huge problem i woke up and open the app and now im stuck at loading screen for like30 minutes now i restarted the app and my phone but still the same and it always say your connection problems but my wifi is strong and stable fix it plzz i will lose a account that i grind and farmed for like 2years if this is not fixed
I love the game long story alot of characters back story side quest and fast
Really great Visual Noval and Game. The Gotcha is not in my favor though.
"Idk where the global server is located but the game says that my connection is slow. But for me, my connection is fast and I don't even remember the last time it was really slow. So if you can make server for each region that would be great. Also I'm Indonesian."
Thank for creating this game i am blessed thnx.üôÇ..i hope i had more times....and pls how can i connect to gmail and save my progress?
Horrible
"I love being able to collect all my favorite servants and new ones as well and fight through the story and events that happen! The only problem is you should never spend money, you won't get the servant you want anyways. Atleast I never did. Spent much more than I should've cause I really wanted Gilgamesh cause he is my favorite servant. Couldn't get him thigh even though his drop rate was up."
It's a great game not really much to complain about except the way of data restoration instead of linking to your Google account in the corner of the start screen it has a spot where you can transfer your data at which point I was never told about even when the game connects to your Google account they can't restore your data if you want to restore your data one thing they want you to tell that's optional but seems more like a needed sense names don't seem to work as a way to restore
I love it I play for almost 3 years I love it
It's honestly a great game but you do need to check your wallet

"Gud game rlly gud, F2p friendly the only problem I see is the loading screens"
I need help trying to retrieve my account my phone broke and I got a new one but Google play didn't save my account and I played for a year please help me
Run out of things to do
"I love the Fate Series and Placing The whole Nasuverse In a Game. Although the Download Server Being Down in GudaGuda3 killed my hype ""- 2 *"""
It is a great game with great characters.
Great story and fun to play. The biggest issue is the gacha rates but that is pretty minor.
"Fun to play with an interesting story, but manual leveling through items (think upgrading weapons in other games), and pathetic gacha odds are clearly designed to frustrate players into spending as much money as possible. This game is accessible to free players, but expect massive amounts of grinding after the 3rd or 4th chapter. Enemy stats also make no sense according to the level scheme, and bosses' HP is padded to absurd levels to force players to purchase revives. Fun but less so if F2P."
"Been playing for roughly a year now. Here's a quick rundown: a great story that starts off slow, but builds up considerably by the time you reach singularity six. Gameplay may seem lackluster, but (for me) strategy for my party comps was crucial by the time you end singularity 5. The grind for mats is long yes, however there are events roughly every month that always increases rate of finding items. Gacha rates are low, however the (first half of) the game is beateable with 1-3 star servants."
Send sq
"Welcoming addition to any fan who are into Type-Moon you gonna enjoy visual wonders, massive story, vast amount of characters, very nice animations, and the gacha...... It is both the worst and best thing about this game. Absolute pain and suffering by not getting the SR or SSR units. But when you do get the things you desire the magnitude of sheer joy will overshadow the salt replace it with happiness."
Fix the loading screen it keeps saying can't connect to download let server idk
"not a fan of phone games, but this one is pretty good, specially if you like the series."
"F/GO Is a great game and has a nice gameplay, but can you add something like offline mode?"
AmazingüôÇ
The best anime gacha game but the updates are 2 years late from the JP server
Lost account and recently started again and it is not new player friendly. Highly not recommend
I wont give it a 5 star due to the salt inducing gacha pulls and stupid spooks i've been getting. Aside from that this game deserves a 4* for just the thrilling plot once you reach camelot and its succeeding story. I for one have been a f2p and been enjoying this game to months end. Dont get discouraged by the lower star reviews of the game and rather judge it yourself if its a game for you or not and note that even 2 or 3* servants are still as effective as 4-5* servant with the correct setup
This game is aMaZiNg! Lol
i love the game i started playing for the story but i ended up loving the game but it is hard to get the sant quartz in the game i love collecting srvent's so please give more SQ and thank youüòä
wow
"It's a fun game, but it can be very annoying to not get the servant you want after spending 200 saints quartz and 50 tickets to get absolutely nothing of value. But other than that it's a fun game"
"I have been stuck on the current special event dialog box for three days. It will not let me close it. I can scroll through everything, so it is not frozen, but clicking on the ""X"" does nothing."
Saint Quartz is wayyyyy too expensive a dollar for 1 saint quarts is highway robbery

So I love the game but since yesterday morning it keeps giving me the two load up errors (either restart the app or clear cache) and I have done both. But for some reason neither of those options seem to be working whenever I attempt to play the game.
waifuable characters in game
Can you add sword art online either then that i love this game
Keeps crashing
Gacha sucks
Its a fun game with a good story
"I really dislike the design of characters in this game no matter how hard I wanted to give it a chance. An overwhelming majority of female servants are drawn to be objectified and sexualized, even the underage looking ones in addition to the ones with huge breasts. Not a fan, but perhaps men would gravitate to this game more. ""Ascensions"" only mean to strip female characters down further and put them in provocative positions. I would have liked to see variety in representation."
"This is quite decent gameplay-wise and story-wise. However, the god forsaken loading probably took up 3/4 of my time spent in this game."
Its a gud game I got one 5-star and three 4-stars and im still lvl 40
"It's a very exciting and a really plot focused game, although the rates are outrageous, it means you can utilize lower rate servants, but 0.0144% rate ups of ssr servants is outrageous, it could use some fixing but that's what makes you unique, hellish rate ups and unguarranted 4 or 5 servants and the sr and ssr spooks really make it worth it for farming SQs"
It does not open
"just ran into a problem, the game wanted me to delete the cache and download, i pressed yes and its just a black screen with a running fou saying that im connecting. moments later i cang connect to the game server and i have a good internet connect this has been going on for a few times now and i cant enter the game :/"
rate up is a lie...
Drop rates for gacha pulls are abysmal. Conversion rate for real money to in game currency is inexcusably expensive. Spending $90 worth of in-game currency only to get nothing but equipment cards I'll never use. :) Don't even bother installing this cash grab made to feed off lovers of the Fate series. <3
"I'm sure most people that stumble into this page has heard a lot rumors about this game: 1) Is this game stingy? Yes, with rate of 1% for 5*, don't expect to pull a 5* every month. If you willing to spend, there are guaranteed 5* banner twice a year. 2) Is this game grindy? Yes. No auto, no animation skip button and core part of team building is getting team that allow you to breeze stage asap. 3) Why is this game popular? World building and characterization, plot can be hit or miss."
A pretty good strategy game with a bunch of interesting characters.
It be great game but they want you to pay to win to much.
"Pull set up is trash, spent over $500 and still didnt pull any 5 star servent. THAT'S the price of a next gen console ü§¨, they need to fix that now. There should never be a case like that with any game ever. And terrible profile save system. Thinking of switching to 7ds, not spending another cent on this money grubbing game. Horribly disgusted with this franchise now."
"Story is good, that's it... battle is easy, you just have to think, but everything else is not worthy of your time. Unfair gacha rates"
Fate waifus and good gameplay too bad I have to use a Vpn just to update it üòê please add Fgo English to European play store
The game's story get's really good once u get to camelot. All the characters have nice voice acting even the 1‚òÜ servants. Events sometimes have hilarious dialogue. No pvp which makes the game very casual non-p2w. Gameplay gets enjoyable too once u get more chars and more difficult enemies with cheesy skills and you don't really need ssr or sr characters to progress(but u have to grail those low tier servants to increase their max lv).
The game is not leting me login and i have asked the dev for help but they have not contacted me back
Yeh best rpg game
Can't even call this a gacha game cause you can't even get a single decent servant challenges are impossible most of the times this game is only baiting you to spend your money not beginner friendly game play other games don't waste your time playing this one
Best game ever it's easier to pull 5 stars with single summons
"I nearly lost my mind trying to get a sleepy, bat NEET with a large bust. 10/10 would delve into the gacha again. Oh and the gameplay is pretty fun too, for what it is. Shows a little age but is fun af"
"This is the most money hungry game I have ever played! I just spent $150 and didn't even get a single 5 star servant. I HATE this game with a burning passion, and I hope more users express the same opinions so that it finally changes. I also hate that this game has a weekly maintenance. It really ruins the experience for me when I have some time to play at night."
Gacha drop rates are abyssmal.
"Good, but the loading is so long"
Waifus everywhere.
"Played for months, took a few months away from the game. Lost access to my account and was told that the info I provided was not enough to get my account back. :( wish I had taken screenshots, only having a transfer code and not linking the account to an email scuffed me since thats how I usually recover my accounts."
"I love this franchise, but honestly it feels 10 years old. Worst rates of any gacha game plus no pity system and stingy as hell with the gacha currency. Daily login rewards are mostly trash(blaze of wisdom). Events lock you out unless you're far enough in the story (still salty about BB.) Ap system means you can't play for more than 10 min. at a time. It doesn't get any better in the future either, after every ten pull you get 1 free pull....Amazing. 1.0 game now. In future...2.0"
i don't why the loading is so long
"This game is so much fun! Worth your time. Story mode is very interesting, though I haven't finished it yet, but overall this game is very great! It's all I can say. 5üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü for this game."
Fgo bad gaem
I hate this game. Will probably play it the rest of my life.
its awsome
"The story and gameplay is good but the gatcha is bad, but overall its good."
My heart is full but my wallet is also full. Stay free to play and spend your quartz wisely!
A very well made game however if you are not a fan of the series or to strategy games then this is not for you especially if you are a free to play player since this game requires heavy dedication in earning the money required to summon things to make your gameplay easier or make your units stronger so if you are a casual gamer who only want to enjoy games and all then prepare to be tested to your limits in both patience and persistence in playing this game.
you can say the gacha is a lie but the game itself is totally awesome
Fun game to play.
I love it entirely Gacha can be a bs with its rates or just the desire censor
I love this game forever üíñ
1 ticket no scathach
Good game and Developers
Great Game. Has all of my favorite servants. My gacha luck sucks but what can you do?
"I like the game and the story especially the Lostbelt arc, got some servants I like but still the rate up is a lie. üòÜ"
The stories are great in my opinion and I love going through them all. Plenty of characters to like and admire. The gacha is the only thing I wish they had a better pity system especially for those who are f2p. But it is still reasonable for them also if they don't get tempted on everything that gets released.
"I have really enjoyed this game and have strongly recommended it to my friends, though there are some really minor issues that pop up and make player mistakes feel worse then they need to"
High quality salt in digital form
The combat on this game alone was enough to merit an uninstall. Terrible.
I won't even let me play
"App won't load at all on my Pixel 3, even after restarting my device and reinstalling the game. It crashes immediately on load, and has every time I've ever tried to load the game - which has been a few times over the last week or two. I reported the problem a few times, but I hope they fix it, because I really liked the anime and would like to play the game it's based on."
"Game is good, graphics are great, sound and voices are good. Gacha is hell though"
It's a amazing game
"Too slow, too complex. Gets in the way of its own enjoyment. Game expects you to read up on the subpar story before learning what you're doing & introduces plenty of mechanics without explaining them. It's a shame - I might actually like the game, but clicking through story event after story event & forcing me to click things I don't understand? Not a good experience & not worth sticking around to figure what's what."
"Got it cause my sister, come to love it"
For how philosophical the entirety of the Fate series is it's a shame that this has degenerated into such unscrupulous insensibility.
I love fate series and this game! :3
Best phone game in existance
Its very interesting
So cool
"I have played this game since launch. I love this game and I still do, but I hate the account recovery system. It is ""primitive"" when compared to other mobile gatcha games. I just wish that they update this part of the game. Me and a couple of my friends dropped this game not because we were bored of it, but because we couldn't recover our accounts when we got new phones; even customer support couldn't help us out."

"I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now since the release and all I can say is that this is one of the best games that fate franchise has come up with. I like how the story progresses but in terms of gameplay, you'll need all the luck you can get since this is a gacha game and without good or decent servants, it really is difficult to progress in the game but that's what this game is, you need to grind and farm your way out of hell."
"A truly beautiful best game ever! A many unique Servants and best voice actor. And with great stories, epic battle and having fun events."
Bro i dont recieve 4 star servant anymore!!!!
Love this game and it has my favourite Heroes.
"This game is my life, even if I don't spend too much money on it, still I believe this deserve it, I have play every day since the first week and haven't stopped even for a day even when I was hospitalized, true story"
God I love this so much i play every damn day and like almost whole day and this is only game i play
"I love Fate, but when I see the gacha rates in this, I already know I'm in for a predatory cash trap. It makes me sad to see this. There are more 5-star servants than 3 and 4-stars in the game, yet the drop pool for a single 5-star servant is 1%, and the odds of you getting a specific 5-star servant is 0.015%. That's a one in a ten-thousand chance. You would have better chances to win the lottery than this. It sucks to see this because this game's story, graphics, and gameplay is solid."
It was a fun game..
The gameplay and grapics are simple yet they get ypu fully engaged in the game the only downside is the slow load times loading up the game and in between missions
Lost all my servants
Best gacha ever. Only the loading issue is keeping me from fully playing this game. 2 mins loading screens breaks immersion
"I cannot recommend this game enough. Fate is the most generous gacha game in existence premium currency is easy to earn, and often gifted. If you don't know this is based off an already popular anime/game/book series so all of the art, voice, and story work is top notch professional. Don't get me started on the characters and main story, which make up enough content to keep you engaged for months. Plus events are held often, and all have their own detailed plot on top of new and unique gameplay."
"Goods: Story/Events are every captivating. You can never get bored with the story, even if it's light-novel style. Servants are well-designed and DW continue updating animations for players' needs. Simple game control but great strategy involvements.The ONLY bad thing: Gacha system is broken. If you're F2P, this game isn't for you unless you don't care much about getting good Servants. Continuous limited and non-limited 5* Servants are very hard to get unless you're willing to spend real money."
"I've tried with three different phones, and several emulators, none of them have been able to run this game..."
Waifu. Enough said.
"While base on series it's good. However, there needs to be a way to skip the lengthy tutorial if you have already played the game before."
It will make you want fictional gems. 10/10
Bad gacha.
Quit playing for a few months and it somehow got worse than it was before
"So I need to update to the newest version wich was updated on may 17th 2020, but as soon as I hit update, it stays updating. I've turned off my phone, closed the app, and still nothing."
always good and really fun game
FCKNG GACHAAAAAAA
A great game best anime game
Love this game!!!!
"Having an amazing roster of characters where you can learn genuinely factual information from these historical characters (most of the time), combined with gameplay that's not as brain dead as other gacha games definitely makes this an EX rank game where you can play for free without ads and buying new content although you do need some luck to get your desired characters in the gacha. Definitely recommend if you are new to the Fate franchise!"
Love this game there shouldbe more servamts you can getfor free like chacha and elizabeth balthory and her alt clases
"Gameplay is boring and repetitive, and the gacha system dishes out mainly craft essences with a few (usually low-tier fodder) Servants here and there. Not even a good gacha, let alone a good game. No sense of fulfillment."
Wifu collection game
It is a rabbithole. I've been here since I touched it for almost 3 years now
"Except from gacha, the story is one of the best I have ever seen. I want to see more actions and features in ""My room"" like in azurlane. The servants have so many story lines in profile tab but still many people don't know about it. You can expand so many options in "" My Room"" feature."
Very nice And thats about it
Good game little behind its jap version some chars could use some tlc but over all not bad for a gacha game story is pretty nice to even if ur not a fate fan and if u are all the better
Still a 5/5 since released. Best mobile gacha game I have played ever.
Excessively long loading times with no sound or music while loading. Note 9.
Really really fun and good story I do want male summer servents though
The game captures the essence of the Fate series/ visual novel.
"The game is 2 years behind the Japanese release. You'll see content in forums and in news articles that you won't get to interact with for 2 years. It's a bad game in it's current US release state and unfortunately, it will continue to be bad until 2 years rolls around. The dev decision to leave the releases unsynced is a ploy to generate more money. Save your time and change. This game isn't worth it."
Good story characters and combat easy to control I personaly enjoy the graphics
"The game is pretty good, but there is a nonexistent pity system in place that only works for 5* servants. There's no pity system at all for 4* servants."
"I lost my transfer code and I have already contacted your support team but still no reply, can you help me? I'll post an actual review after, thank you."
Not yet played game. Looking foward to seeing this game.
"Fairly entertaining, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're already a fan of the Fate franchise"
Good gameplay and amazing animation especially on noble phantasms. Though some of the ssr rate ups are plain disgusting.
"Great stories and characters, average mobile gameplay, absolutely predatory gacha. Loading on android is trash."
Its a gacha game but the best one
I've played this game for years and still find it enjoyable.
"To put simply, this game is a cashgrab. Although the visuals, the story, and the characters are amazing, I do not recommend this game to anyone. I put thousands of hours into the game, it is the addiction to it that keeps me here."
"Good experience overall, Is just like reading a light novel with basically Fate characters as protagonists, NPs look good but gacha is bad Civilization. Also a lot of salt, enough to build a mine."
"It might be boring at first but once you know how the game works, it's pretty fun. You'll really enjoy this if you are familiar with a lot of the characters from the Fate series."
Gacha Hell ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Good but if you don't gave luck on your side spending money will prob be the best way to getnop characters
"Great story and fun animations, the gatcha is cruel but as is the case with most games like this."
The game that use to test your luck :) Good luck with it :)
It doesnt run on S10e(Exynos)
I really enjoy this game because i able to get servant that i loved in the novels and shows and this game has some level of skill to it
summoning Heroic Spirits are quite unfair its like I have E- luck agghhh!!
"A fantastic game but heavily grindy game. The story is fantastic and the gameplay is fun and tactical. With constant events coming out there's always a plethora of content to indulge in. The only real gripe I've had with the game is the abysmal gacha rates, but having rare servants is in no way required for story progression."
The writing in this game is excellent for its genre. The artwork is beautiful. Content is also very accessible for low-budget or Free-to-Play players to enjoy. (And Archer finally seems to be enjoying his existence X3)
Fun game with a great story. Especially enjoy the seasonal events
I got Okitaüòéüòé
1. You will die a lot 2. You will cry a lot 3. You will curse a lot 4. But you will have a lot of happy memory playing this game.
"Very grindy, but it's also fun and challenging. The story gets better as you go through chapters. Gacha rates are do or die, but you can get through battles with low rarity Servants. It's part of the fun. Characters are especially fun and unique. It's hard not to get attached."
Nifty
I adore this game for the story characters and events. Gatcha is rough but I've been lucky
Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha!
"Really, really needs to streamline grinding."
It's got cute boys
I like this game!!! Keep it up!!!
So addictive
"Wifu material and interisting story line, got hooked on it :) and nice events being held which added on its entertainment :)"
The game is very fun.. I'm hooked.. Would be good tho if they have will have more options to farm Saint Quartz..
Really fun for Fate fans.
"gachanya ampas sih, tapi yaudahlah namanya juga cari duit"
It'a awesome game to play.
"Other than the cancer-inducing gacha, i think this is a superb game. If they raised that SSR rate to, let's say, 2 or 3%, I think it would be perfect game"
i'm a fan of fate now
"I have played FGO since it first started tbh and honestly still love it a lot despite being on and off. It works great with my current phone and I love these types of games. From the story to the awesome servants, its a wonderfully built game to enjoy."
Yah it gud
Good game !
RATE UP IS A LIE THAT IS THE ONLY PROBLEM IN YOUR GAME!!!!!
Karna is a very epic husbando 10/10
Best and I'm blank
"Lucky enough to be able to get 5 star servant, Im just returning the favor"
5 stars!!
"For all of you who are complaining about the gacha, just join the cult lol"
"Story: starts a little slow, but picks up. lots of events, too! Gameplay: more strategy than active play. has cool animations, tho Gacha: pray or pay. 1% 5-star character is pretty rough, but you can at least use others'. they're also not necessary, but they can make playing a lot easier"
"This game is weeby and reminds me of the Korean War. I have placed my mana all over my phone several different times, and it won't come off. Please send your nearest Emiya Shirou to help me with the situation."
This game is gay.... It is my favorite mobile game
"An interesting interactive novel style game. Only drawback is a grind to improve characters. Those with patience will do well over the long haul, regardless of which characters you obtain."
"Full VN level story. An annoying but ultimately minor issue is that the plot assumes you have participated in events you probably weren't around for and may not come around again for a long time. Not in major ways, just a ""oh yeah we already know this person from X"", but you've never been a part of X, kind of way. So them showing up and helping is kind of nonsense."
"Long time fate series fan, love the story, characters, soundtrack and even though its 2020 it still remains my top game and most played game since release... Sorry for the late review and thank you for the best game of the fate series."
Waifus go brrrr
Very Fun!!!!!
Great game but can't play anymore. Download and can't open it
Honestly would probably be a five star if the app didn't crash on me for a whole month straight I haven't been able to play since then
Crippling depession comes with a salt flavor Gacha go brrrr
Not a fan of the long loading screens.
The game is awesome and has incredible graphics
Need free ssr...................... Mmm
I would love to play if it would work but it wont at the tutorial sabers noble phantasm makes my game say connection to download server is loss even when i still am connected to wifi
I tried to replay this game for 2 rounds at different timeline and i still could not enjoy due to the gacha rates and its so hard to F2P players as the reward system is getting worse. Completed the same stage 3 times to get one crystal and not even all the stage has it ??? I am ok with the gameplay the animation and character design are nice but too me its not to worth to spent so much money on time and the event is a joke i cant even play a single event due to the requirments.
-Updated. Recently they released various sprite animation updates for characters early and I must say they are much needed. Again. If you are looking to start playing this game now is a good time. The only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars is the static illustrations. I've seen fans edit and give the already beautiful illustrations more life when they give them small animations. Overall I am loving my time playing the game. A must for Fate fans. Ushi animation update when?
sliiiiightly upset my chromebook in apperantly an ''emulator'' and cant load this
The story will hook you up. The Servants itself is full of flavors to explore. The challenge to get them strong will make you want to grind I just hope the availability of saint quartz are a little bit higher to the point you can get atleast 5 saint quartz in weekly quest
good game i think i lost my sanity here
One of the best Mobile games
Mediocre gameplay at best. Horrible gacha. This game is carried by its story which is very boring in the begining. Grinding saint quartz takes several tedious battles of multiple waves of enemies. If this wasnt fate this game would have failed as it should have.
Can the game make like facebook bind account or google bind? I love this game but im scared of losing my acc
Play this game now it has so much Lore historic figures Legendary Heroes and myths but be wise and save your quartz and be aware the gotcha is isn't easy on everyone tho.
Fate/GrandOr_
"I like how the story pulls you in on like your really the main character,but I would like to request that the characters had voices to the story if that's optional."
Sends me right to an email page. Wish I could play but oh well.
loading time so longgggggggg. you must do something together when play this game.
The game could use some optimization for better performance. The interface is very dated.
As someone who generally finds mobile games mediocre I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only did this game have solid gameplay but that once you got through the early chapters the writing vastly improved to the point where this is probably one of the best written games producing content this year. This is the first game to sell me on mobile gaming as a serious platform. I highly recommend it.
keep missing events.
Engine update killed my phone
Fun game with lots of cool characters even if it gets very grindy.
10/10 would recommend.
"It's FGO, come on."
Is a pain
"Bad game with an extremely boring story and content, the creators just want to profit from the in game gacha for rare characters."
Tanginang laro
"An individual driven by fate to summon ancient heroes (I.e. historic waifus AND husbandos) to fight in order to safeguard the future of humanity? Written by top tier story writers? Characters drawn by different artists and voiced by famous Japanese VAs? A compelling and addictive gameplay? This is hell I'm walking into, and Idk WHAT TO DO!!! For real tho, if any of this sounds fascinating to you then i say this game is worth it, lol!"
I LOVE THE GAME
Everytime I try to open app it takes me straight to my email... with an address to you all
Best App on the store!
"I lost my account, cause of a damn code i forgotten. Maybe if you guys simply had a bind to facebook option it wouldnt had happened."
Never used
Very fun turn-based rpg. A lot of events and a surprising amount of depth for a mobile game.
"Gacha is hell, but the game is fun."
Yeet noice
I've played this game in the past and i loved it but i lost everything when i had to get a new phone it suck because i had saber in a wedding dress that was by far my favorite summon i ever did and i lost it. and to be honest i can't believe I'm playing this again because of what happened. i hate games that don't save all your stuff but it is a good game besides what happened.
Another best game best game 10/10
"the only good thing in this game is the storyline, but this game is a poor excuse for a gacha game."
Great but I can't seem to login and it keeps saving to clear the cache then it froze when it shows the blue screen which shows a servant description. Its been almost a week now and I still have the same problem. Please someone fix this!
Doesn't work. Opens my PayPal
"I am very thankful to the support staff that never failed to helped me when I messed up with the usb debug and the transfer number. I don‚Äôt have much to offer but I hope this rating can help even a little bit. Also the app is a good game too, but seriously, thank you so much support staffÔºÅThanks to you I can play again üò≠üò≠üò≠üíïüíïüíïüíï"
">Heard game was interesting >installed >launched, game crashed immediately >researched, found this is common >disappointment = maximum >uninstalled Can't rate the gameplay elements of a game that doesn't work. I do hope they fix the instant crashing, though. It's a shame to see such an interesting looking game be completely unplayable."
Always loved the fate series! Except for the long loading time but im glad that theres update to resolve it soon!
The game isn't pay to win at least
Great game!!!!!!
Since you won't reply to this . Hate it
"Game crashes upon start, isn't even playable. Im using the Samsung A51."
Gimmie my tuburculosis saber waifu
"By far the most addicting gacha game for me, it is such a wonderful experience even for the non-anime fans out there you can totally have a great time playing this kinda game especially when u get ur fav servant SRR lovelots"
I love this game. It can be repetitive and You can get screwed out of SR and SSR for awhile but it's all random. You can easily play free to play and have a lot of fun and the animation updates really make this game better and better.
"Pretty decent for a gatcha game, they give away a lot of quartz just for going through the campaign. Combats a little basic though"
PLS GIVE ME SSR SERVANTS IM TIRED OF GETTING GOLD CE'S ITS PAINFUL
"Can't even load the game, galaxy s10"
10/10 absolute HELL Worst game ever made
BEST GAME EVA
SSR are not real
4 Billion down the drain no 4 or 5 star servants no 5 star ce
Need more options to get quartz.
"Been playing since Launch, and now Everytime I open the app it crashes immediately"
Due to game deciding not to load when starting up the the app and having to reload the app multiple times just to get it to run i have decided to finally delete FGO from my phone. I've been playing since day 1 launch but can't bear to keep doing this process that takes up to 5 mins just to get to the loading screen. Thank you for the support!
"Ahh, Fate. The first ever game to drag me to gacha hell. I've only played it for a few years and I still haven't gotten bored with it."
This is hell what we are leaping in to
Not working
The load times are just atrocious. No auto. Keep milking the cash cow tho.
Though the English version is engaging but I find it expensive for players to get 1 unregistered spirit origin heck get 10 for a servant? You'd have to have crazy luck to pull the same ssr sevant 15 times so I hope that you can make it easier for us to get unregistered spirit origins. Also is it possible to make the Japanese version available in Singapore?
Lost all my game data
The game play gets better and beter! Can't wait for NA to get the system upgrade. Rate up is a lie sometimes. smh
Perfection.
"Gameplay is easy to learn, difficult to master. Low ranked servants are useful so free to play options are here. Story is fun and pretty well written. I enjoyed it immensely."
Got a load of money? Try to find your wifu here and you will eat instant noodle for the whole month.
It's fun and easy to pick up. Wouldn't recommend to those who don't know or like anything about Fate series but I have enjoyed every second I've put into this game.
Wish I could give it a better rating. Won't even let me open the app
I hope they'll fix the bug where the game freezes when you lose connection.
"I absolutely love this game. My ONLY complaint is that I stopped playing for a while due to personal life reasons but I did setup a transfer just Incase I wanted to come back, well I did and I had no way of getting my account back due to losing/misplacing the code. In no way is this the dev's fault, purely my own for not putting it in a secure place. However, it would be a nice quality of life change to have some sort of login system such as connecting the account to an email for easier access."
I can't open the game it crashed everytime I tried tu play please help
"Great game. The characters and story are well written, and the gameplay is fairly easy. The gacha rate is pretty bad, but the game does give you welfare units to help you out. Smash Mash since she will carry you late game. In addition, grailing low star servants will help you too, so grail your favorites. Other than that enjoy the story. There are plenty of waifus and husbandos to keep you engage in the game."
Can't run the game. It crashes before it displays anything then forces me to write an email... about... it? Horrible error management. My phone is more recent then the game and I cleared up some RAM and space before launching it...
"I Love this game as you can play at your own pace, its a pure PvE game so you never feel rushed. A couple easy weekly quests and simply logging in once a day is all you really need to do to get the free currency. 5 stars are of course, rare, but almost every servant in the game does the job. So you need to SAVE for the people you want. No in game cash shop (just paid currency bundles that's it) no ads, balanced servants for most part. Great storytelling!"
I hate this app ‚ù§
zero skill required hell like gacha slow loading money taking late version of japan no pvp singleplayer tHAT REQUIRES INTERNET LOSABLE ACCOUNT
"I tried to recommend this game to my friends but only a few of them actually took their sweet time with it and only one is still playing with me, we compare the things we rolled from time to time. So to those reading this review, sure this game is easy to get through for like a week, just know that things will get hard and that's coming from my experience with this game. But if you really decide to stick around then it really is worth it, good graphics, good story just good in everything."
I'd like to play it but I'm from Southamerica :(
"Game ampas, tapi main sampe 500 day login streak"
Internet is problem but the game is good
"I have been playing this game for 2 years. Best mobile game I've ever played. Yes there are a few flaws but those flaws can be overlooked in my opinion. The characters and story are amazing, granted it does take a while for the story to get good. The viability of lower rarity units is what makes this game great. There is zero need to spend money when most low rarity units will be better than high rarity ones."
Real good üí™ game to play
"A solid turn-based RPG game. If you're a fan of the fate series, you should try it, but it's pretty nice even if you're new to it. Though I must say that a majority of gameplay is farming/grinding in events and such. The summoning system has one of the worst rates, but the game is very doable with low-rarity units and borrowing a friend's unit. The story starts out as decent, but it really ramps up a lot later on. I'd say it's worth a shot. Been thru lot of bs as JP and EN player, but it's üëç"
Inpresive
An auto mode would make it easier to play especially people who work please add an auto battle feature! Ill play forever then
Yeeeeeesss
Fun game the drop rate sucks though
I cant open the app its sucks it says network eror even my wifi connetion is strong pls fix it i really want to play this game
It's a really good game to be honest but the loading took so much time 30 sec or more it if its 5 sec I will accept it.
"This game is amazing, even though only I only downloaded it in a few days in makes mo happy and I'm already addicted to it, I love the way that you don't need to spend real money to buy things because you can actually work for it unlike other games to takes ages or it force you to spend some real money to buy things to make your character stronger keep up the good work :)"
"Honestly it would be fixed to 5 stars if the summons were separate. Getting a 4 or a 5 star summon and 3 star servants over and over is not fun. Spent 90 quartz and got no 4 star servant. Shop is also says one summon is worth 32.99, which is rather high. Game is fun and I love Fate, but this is bad."
Camalot. Need i say more.
"It's ok. Would've given it 4 stars but honestly the only good thing about the game is the story and the characters. BUT, to get the characters you need to pay (or good luck) and to beat the story you need the characters."
"The best gacha game, been playing this **** since launch. I have no life, plz help :'("
Musashi and jeanne is the best girl
New player freindly
The game is excellent. However I can't even play it because the app won't even launch. Keeps crashing. I have tried to uninstall then reinstall but that didn't work. This was caused by the most recent update.
The game is great until it can't work anymore for some reason.
This is the best gacha game i ever play but can you give a free SSR tickets in English server
^^ it's awesome
I really enjoyed the game but when I went to change cellphones I made a back up file and it says that my back up ID is already in use which isn't right. I lost alot of servants
I like It This Game
It's fun but the progression seems way to slow whether it's xp or gaining stars for draws. I usually save up for a year so I can draw twice. Also the events feel tedious unless you have the specific event units and unless you got cash to burn you might not get to into it. As for experience it would be nice if your units gained xp from battles and it did not depend solely on card sacrifice and if that's the case atleast if the quality of draws was better or access to gold enhance was better.
I'll give you more five stars if you give us more 5 stars in the future! :)
Best game with ultra drop rate gacha*
"It is a really good game tbh, my only problem is when I play it takes too long to load"
"Help, when i open the game in android 7.0 i get a white screen and then redirected to write an email to ""fate go US""."
Last update game will not load
Most addicting gacha especially for fans. Story is really good which is why the later singularities are turned into full animes. Really recommend for those who want to get into fate or those who are already diehard fans
"ok I cleared everything I said cuz I have the guts to reset my phone and things goes smoothly too (manage to pull jalter b4 she gone, and addition to umu girl). Still a grindy and rage game, but overall its good"
I Became a Masochist Playing this Game
"Won't let me open the game, when I try to open it the game prompts me to send an email to support. Edit: support was helpful though"
"Best story in a mobile game, with a nice strategy based combat system."
Just spent half of my allowance for a jpeg waifu. Nice 10/10 will do again next time.
"Can't boot, get a white screen. S10e"
"This game is hell, I love it"
"Im taking away two stars from my rating for one reason only and that is because my account can't get linked to anything. I've played this game twice and the first time I deleted it not knowing that my progress would be completely erased and the second time I had no choice but to delete other apps in order save space but my phone crashed and once again my progress was deleted with it. So until this game gives u the option to link your account I'm never playing it again. Other than that, 5/5 Game."
"I played the game since it was launched on America and it was great. When MIUI 11 came up the app didn't work so I had to re install and when it get to work all my data was erased I don't know my ID number because it's horribly long and I had to stop playing, wish I could get help"
"It's a fun game, great characters, Noble phantasms are cool, to do one summon is clearing one singularity and a little of the next. My one big problem is the chances of getting a craft essence, for example you could hit a multi summon and get 4 of the same 4* or 5* craft essences instead of getting a 4* or 5* servant. You could also get the same 3* servant 3 times and the same craft essence 7 times. Summons mainly depend on gacha so I can't complain too much. Craft essence % is just too high"
"Lost my account, emailed customer support and got it back within 2 days with no problems."
A classic.
"It's really fun and I love it. It's gacha isn't that forgiving, but there are enough strong f2p units that you dont need to spend any money to get far in it. With the exception of the granted 5 star paid banners, that happen 2-3 times a year, I haven't spent any money on the game yet and I can still keep up with the people that do spend money on it."
"1 tix, 1 SSR. Fight me! ( Ô¨æ_Ô¨æ)"
great game but need alot of time
Gameplay is gacha
"It's the famous Fate universe and its waifus/husbandos in a gacha game with fun gameplay, good story. The gacha rate is awful and the amount of free currency for summons you get is ultra limited, this NA version is 2 years lagged behind the JP version (not only story mode, but also the quality of life changes), hence this specific version only gets 4 stars, it has few flaws, but the ones it has, it's depressing. If you wanna play for the story mode, go for it, it's worth it, it's still worth it"
i rate it 5 stars now gimme 5 star servant
The only problem i had in this game is the loading times is very long...
"This game is all right overall, but a giant mixed bag. Game is simple, but is painfully slow to raise units due to massive grinding and materials required. Plus, there's no auto run feature or enough farming areas to compensate for it. Don't expect to beat Arc 1 in 8 months. Don't bother with the 1% gacha rate. For positives, the music is phenomenal, and the story, save for ch 2 & 3, can be really engaging and fun, like a visual nice. It's a fine game. Just a bit niche for me."
"i've been playing this game for 18 months and I enjoyed every bit of it, however the extremely long load time is just making want to smash my head in wall. seriously 1 minute 50 seconds just to enter stage?"
"I've been palying this game since it's release. But i've lost my transfer number, Is there any way for me to get my account back? Thanks"
"The game is amazing, I just wish the updates didn't take up so much space. That might be hard but... Anyway, this is an amazing game, probably my favorite, the storyline is intriguing. And to top it all off, the ladies can be pretty. It has historical and legendary figures, which can be very helpful. The best thing to see is when you're doing a summon and you see that golden twinkle."
"This game is great i love how it has a deep story that keeps players attention and how there is so many heroes from history and stories, but the only thing I think they need to work on is the summoning system to make it more favorable for the players who want a higher rank hero."
Engine Update please
"I don't know if it's just my phone that's lagging or it's the game itself, but it took me 3 minutes at minimum in loading page, watching Fou running on the lowest right part of my phone, everytime I start a game. I mean, I hope you lessen the time it takes to load up a game, as it ruin the over all gameplay for me."
I got bored at the story but i like the gameplay i also hate that you can summon items
Unbelievable
"Can't recommend enough, but be careful! Honestly, amazing game play experience, with amazing story and no need for 5 star servants to complete anything story-wise. Premium currency is not too rare, and while others say the gacha is awful, I've been playing for 3 weeks or so and have 2 SSRs so, maybe I'm just lucky? Anyways, the game is grind heavy (especially to level up servants!) and you won't always get what you want from gacha. Just play with an open mind and enjoy the story and characters."
Fate grind order is sexy great and fun
"Would put 5 stars but rates for gacha are not great. Campaign grinding/quartz drops are not great either especially on top of the long loading times and multi-step quests. Though the story is great, and characters are awesome. I still enjoy the story more than anything."
It's cool
This game is good once you get that specific servant which is gonna make you very happy.
Has great potential but is very much after your cash and teases you.
is good
Awful game
It's a pretty good game doubt you could play it for 2 years straight logging in everyday
"One of the best mobile games I've played. Dozens of Heros to choose from, each with their own voice and back story. The game play is fun and isnt reliant on microtransactions.There is an extremely engaging story, unlike many mobile games that claim to have an amazing main story in adds, but don't actually have much of a plot in game, we all know what game I mean rhymes with ""PaidShallowLeggings. Fate/Grand Order is really a true gem and deserves the praise & attention it's received."
"Used to love playing. Now it just crashes immediately upon opening, even after reinstall. Update: seems disabling developer options allows me to play so I'll bump up my review a bit. Still shouldn't be such an issue."
"This game is a great time, great characters and the gameplay is easy to pick up. The gatcha rates aren't great but it makes it that much more satisfying when you get a Merlin or Waver. Ps. Don't put money into this, just go F2P and enjoy it for what it is"
The drop rates could be higher
Other than the crappy drop rates this game is excellent.
Are the server down? I cant seem to update or even login
Good game play
"If the grind was a little faster and load times were lowered, then I'd rate 5 stars"
Just be patient ull get a good hero soon w/out paying. With a goodluck i got my saber nero after a couple of weeks playing. A good game i recommend it to all fate fans out there
This is a very good game with a great cast of characters
Never disappoints
The greatest COOL
Very fun just wish the gacha rate was a little better. Amazing story tho
Lots of fun with a hilarious and great story.
A game for every FSN fan.
Decent. Been playing it for 2 year now. Honestly starting to feel like chore
Loooove it!
I hate this game as much as i hate myself for playing it (Highly recommended for those who have crippling depression)
"I really like this game. There are elements that remind me of Chain Chronicle, which I really liked as well. The combat system is simple yet also requires some level of strategy. The story and characters are on point. Some of the more recent events have felt a bit repetitive and boring, though."
"Summoning rate it awful, especially during event banners when you're looking to get CE's to help you out."
2 years of playing. Sorry developers I didn't paid stars just to desperately get some 5 stars. I had 3 accounts playing and every profile had a good set of servants. It's just a matter of how to use heroic spirits carefully. But I totally agree that you need more 5* servants to excel. Thanks by luck I manage to get good 5*. Love the game keep improving.
Waiting for Okita Alter in June NA Server
Good game üëç
"Draw for Waifu/husbando and have a good time, if not, prepare for gacha hell."
If you like having your hopes and dreams being destroyed this is the game
"5 star pulls are low as it gets, but you still can make friends with people who have em. Use. Hans. Play for the story, cause that's most of the content."
Good gameplay
"Fate Grand Order is a game set in Type Moon Universe. This is the game which story trully define the game. Although the mechanics is on the older side, mind you the game have been released in 2015. The 2 years gap between global server compared to the Japan, gave global player an edge by having prediction of what events or Gacha Banner will occur. Although the Gacha rate is on the low rate side, you don't actually need good units to clear the content. Hence pretty much Free to Play."
"Keeps crashing every time I try to open it, I haven't got to play in weeks anyone else experience this ?"
Good game but rate up is a lie. No üß¢
Hmmph!
"It's an unregulated casino. Every part of the game is set up to direct you towards the slot machine summoning system. Story? Free buffet and show to keep you interested. Plus, you like this character? Well, either hope you have godly luck, or fork over some cash (~$140 for 50% to get a 'rate up' character), because the majority of them are limited time only. Gameplay is mostly just grind to build sunk cost. That, and an incentive to roll the slots for things to reduce the amount of grind."
"The story and history of each servant was great. The developer of this game is a genius, keep it up and keep updating"
My first Gacha game. Love it so much.
Great story and interesting characters
It's a great game I'm not sure who some of the characters are I have only seen Zero. Gameplay is ok the cards are an interesting new fight system but the game feels slow.
Hope to see a pinoy hero to be a servant
I have been playing this game for about 10 months now and it has been a great experience. The gacha can be hell but when you get that servant you desperatly want its such a great feeling. The battle mechanics are wonderful and i love the fact that aniplex is always trying to keep players entertained with as much content as possible. Keep up the great work.
"I play this game for a long time. The only things that got me into the game is either the characters or the story line. I stop EN version a long time ago and start the JP. The rate up is so low. The game play is not that interesting. If you like it you'll like it, but overall, it's very easy to get bored"
ALAB IT!
Sensitive to Internet connection
I hate it but its gacha nonetheless lmfao
"I love it, both as a game and as an unrivaled salt mining simulator."
I hate it!! Yet I love it so much The story is one of the if not the greatest of all mobile games!! Each one of the 300+ characters are unique and has their own personality which makes each one lovable in their own way
Thank you for bringing this wonderful game here. Keep up the good work~
I have fun but sometimes the material grind sucks. Also the story is cheeks until Singularity 6 üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Amazing game and I love it
"Good game, and true to the Fate series"
"This game is a lot of fun but it is a huge money trap, be warned"
Good but annoyingly gatcha and unlike in most gacha games it feel exasperating to get a craft essence after you've farmed for saint quartz
damn i love this game so much as much as i lile the anime.those waifu thou are thicc
"Bloody Gachas, amirite"
Getting 4 or even 5 star servents is very difficult and obtaining saint quarts is kinda tedious
App won't even start; it kept saying new version available for download. I already updated to the latest version! After this now Google play listed the update. Wth üò°
The best! Loved it since seeing the babylonia anime
I like the gameplay but the bad thing is I can't link it to anything to save the game
"Historical waifus, a fun plot with constant events going on, a great community, lots of guides for beginners, easy, fun and complex game play, very friendly towards beginners. Would replay the whole game."
Fun and definitely a good way to pass the time. Especially for Fate fans
pls give me more 5 stars
It would be better if there's a skip NP animation.
Ghana And love the random moments
Good game but lagging in load time
Great game love the gameplay & characters
Every time you need to update it give you a hard time and you cannot open the app
It's got thighs
Great game slow at the start but pick up after a week of gameplay
I already update but say i need to update. This is frustrating
Fuantastico
Whilst the summoning system is a little unbalanced I've come to genuinely enjoy everything else about the game and have learned to look past it
"I really enjoy this game, however I've run into a problem. I got an alert to update the game and did so, but when try to get on the game I still get the alert...I can only hope that this gets fixed and that I don't lose all my hard work on this game."
Love the gameplay(pretty addicting)and the amount of stuff you can earn by playing but i find that the prices for their currency is too much considering the actual chances you have of getting the characters you want is slim to none. You would expect to have a greater chance when spending as much as a triple A game on it but don't count on it.
Fixed
Long time fan of the series. That being said. Do not make the mistake I did and waste your money. I've had three accounts I've spent exuberant amounts on. Couldn't get the first two back after phones died. They are not friends of the fans. The amounts of money it takes to get what you need is outrageous. Oh btw your latest update wont let me into my account again. Downloaded update and still tells me I need to download something even though that's no longer an option in the store. GREED.
"I think that some people may have some problems by not being able to play the game, but it works fine, it's just some people are just unlucky, but overall it is a successful japanese app game which made it's own reputation, memes, of course some people may complain about the maitnance being longer than it supposed to be, but without it, it wouldn't be fun to make jokes about it."
Love it I've always loved fate and I'm do happy I got Gilgamesh
The gacha is bad but who care -_-
Nicesu
Nito mai waifu
"It has problems but out every other gacha game I've dropped after a month or two fgo made me stay if you have bad luck you won't like playing fgo to much but it's not like the 3 stars are bad and there's welfares that are good the story is good animations are good if you have a bad phone the loading time is really bad but I still play, there's lots of waifus and husbandos so I'm sure you'll find someone you'll like I wouldn't recommend spending a lot I only buy gssr and that's it."
It's a pretty good game
Love the game I'm a huge fan of the anime I've watched every fate series so playing this game with some of my favorite characters is awesome.
tis so good yes.
great game and summoning system is very generous
Increase the gacha rates. Saving up for a while to not get the servant you wanted is soul crushing
Very good story and gacha isn't as bad as everyone says if you have any self control with saving for who you'd like very generous game with tons of content
Wholesome anime story and fighting scene
Still have some bugs
gacha rates lower than my self esteem
I like it History game
"Love the game, easily my favorite mobile game at the moment. unfortunately I lost my phone and had to start over completely"
"I love the game, storyline and characters but there'stwo things that makes me give this game a 1 star first is the gameplay its boring for me a game that makes you sleep just playing the introduction is a bad game second is the gacha system man people is gonna complain about the lack of 5 star they got but for me its the mechanic itself putting the characters and the equipment made the gacha system bad i mean they could make it separate or make it farmable but they dont..."
Like the game but can't get past the loading screen since the last update. Keeps telling me that app didn't launch properly. Can anyone please assist?
I love this game it's like back to the Future but with Anime!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçüòçüòç
I really like everything about the game but needs a lot of time for grinding that most people can't focus on reading the story and playing events at the same time. Hope they add a feature where you can skip np animation while doing a free quest which is already completed once. It will help the game alot.
I love this game to the Core completed every single day for the past four or five months. Tonight I spent $123 on summons and they didn't even have the respect for their customers enough to give big fenders a single four or five star servant. I've been a fan of the feet series for over a decade since 2007. I'm afraid after this I'm done with type c feet and most especially Grand order unless an admin comes down from on high give me three five star servants right now yeah right they don't care
This game need improvements badly you always gotta save up quarts for your favorite or a important servant bad enough you might not even get them you'll fail or either get the opposite events are boring and the campaigns don't give out much pleses fix fgo I still love it tho it's still a good game thoses who left already from fgo just gave up I stood with it until I got some good 5 stars from scratch too but yeah good game.
I like fate series and this game too
"Best RPG-Gacha game. You dont need summon ssr or sr, 1-3 stars + your brain can do the quest. Always give many free 4 star servant every year. Gameplay is good, grahic is awesome, story is cool, but gacha is terrrribbble... Play it slowly, the ap generated very low. Just enjoy it!"
Good service üëç
Wait for me astolfo!!!!!!!!!
The game is Very addicting You will get very interested in stoy after playing Plus the servents have their own stories
"It's an okay game, though the Telltale style of the illusion of choice makes some responses to what you say make little sense during the campaign. It's also extremely annoying that they force you to have somebody else's servant in your party for every battle since it either carry's you through or you're forced to spend time finding one near your level so you can have some form of difficulty; they need to make it an optional thing instead of forcing it on you."
Five stars for a 5* maybe üëÄ
Game keeps crashing on my phone. Was looking forward to play this as a fate fan
"If you are a fan of the Nasuverse and can't get enough of learning about new Servants, I highly recommend you play this game. The story and events are interesting, and it's always a pleasure to see characters from the other Nasuverse series pop in. However, the gacha is very unforgiving (1% chance of getting a 5* Servant), so whale with care or you'll end up in the salt mines."
RATE-UP IS A LIE
"Update for year 2020, Fate/Grand Order is great, i was a huge fan of the Fate series since playing Fate/Stay Night way back in 2012, its a great franchise, all the servants you get in the game are all unique, with their very own personality, story and lore. The only qualm that most players have and myself is that the gacha rates are very unforgiving and it might be hard to get the servant that you really want, all you can hope is just roll and plenty of good luck! Play well, masters!"
Great story and Gameplay
"Well story wise, as expected from a product of Type Moon but.. yeah Gacha and QP hell"
I've played this years ago but stopped and i just returned from playing again this year. Reason i stopped before coz of the app crashing while playing and it annoyed me. I'm having fun right now since i'm fan of the series. I dont have any problems as of yet aside from the abyssmal drop rate. Atleast increase the rates a little bit somehow. Up to 5% wont hurt you know and 7% during rate ups. event CE drop rates during events is bad as well but doesnt concern me much. 4* only coz of droprates.
It says failed to connect to downloading server don't know what to do
"I love the gameplay and the story line, the animation is good (not great). My only problems with the game are the frequency of drop items being too low, and the chance of getting a GOOD 5 star unit is too low."
I want a genghis khan grand rider or a solomon
I like salty food. This game satisfies me.
"Play for story, Stay for Waifus/Husbandos"
Can't download to my Chromebook 3 and makes me sad. Playing this game was one of the main reasons I got a Chromebook.
"80% of the low ratings on this game are people upset at their bad rolls. I've never had to dip below 200 Saint Quartz to get a Servant that I wanted, 5‚òÜ or otherwise. I'm not even addicted to the game. I play the story when each singilarity is released, and every other event. The materials and Golden Apples you get from the events are enough to completely max out all your Servants, and I legit haven't run out of AP in years. I beat the hardest boss of the current game with a team of 3‚òÜs for fun."
"They should add Genghis Khan, and if hes already in and i've just missed him my bad"
Fgo is one of the only games I actually keep on my phone.The only thing I can say is that if you arent a very patient person than this is not the game for you because this is a grindy game and the gacha rates can kill some people.But once you start to play the game you get invested in charaters and plot.
"Installed game, clicked to open, sat at white screen for 2 mins, uninstalled/reinstalled still nothing."
I installed it and can't even open the app. I'm a little annoyed about it. I even sent feedback about it
wasn't able to open app
Outstanding game but the gacha % rates was exhausting
I know it must suck if you have bad luck but that's reality and reality is harsh
5v5 arena archer is a marksman Saber is the figther Caster is a mage Assasin is a Assasin Rider to tank Figther to caster Masters is support I thinküòÇ
wont let me in
Love the game maybe the rates aren't the best but the feeling of getting one is worth it
Niceoo
Love the game after hard grinding and terrible gacha. I worked hard on it and now have a great team.
Developer options need to be off
Great game. A must have for all FSN fans
Fun game. Need a good net connection to play.
"I enjoyed the game a lot, but I linked my account and got a new phone. Unfortunately, that also meant my code was gone too. When I attempted to contact the support for assistance in retrieving my account. I never heard back from anyone. Therefore, I am unable to proceed forward. Were it not for my problems with game procession due to a lack of customer service, I would have actually rated the game as a five star game."
I start a completely new game and guess what my phone crashes I swear this game is f****** curse if you don't want to risk your phone do not play it I'm about to test it on a brand new phone so let's see if this one breaks. great game but like most mobile games transfer codes only work once this so when my new phone turned out to be defective I lost all the money spent on this game and all my data. a lot of work time and money. at least I remembered why I don't spend money on mobile games.
I'm too broke for this game
"Its good but seems unoptimized for Android. While the fps is not an issue, Loading times take too long for me to enjoy it properly. It runs fine however on IOS."
I love this game i have played it for about 2 years but I recently lost my account. I emailed the company plz help me get my account back. I reccommend everyone try this game it is amazing^^
"waifus and traps, enjoy."
Love this game and the series as well. The controls are good and you can put together your dream team.
5 Star because I hate this game to the point that i want to throw my phone. And now I can't even stop myself from playing this anymore.
"Imagine a company releasing a game to the US two years behind, all flaws and errors included, to give the authentic ""sh**ty Japanese experience"", but add the fact that it's a running like dogs**t on phones that are 2 years newer. Why does such a simple game take 45s-1min to load the exact same stale stage I just ran every single time. This game is 99.9% grinding the same thing over and over, and they can't get that right."
"Great game. Great story. Astolfo is hot. 5 out of 5. No questions. No buts, No cuts, No coconuts. Tho I do nut for Astolfo. Those nuts are ok. In fact... nutting for Astolfo is the best thing you can do. Don't knock it till ya try it!"
Great game I wish the best for the new events and the new chapters
enjoying the game so far
Haven'y been able to play because every time I try to open the app if just crashes. Hopefulpy it works for others. But as for me I'm not happy with this. Checked and my phone meets the requirements to run this app.
Love it!! And the characters
"It wasn't like this before. Many months ago when I played this game, even 4G Signal Coverage with 1 bar or H+ Signal Coverage can let me bypass everything despite the signal coverage given. Right now... there's a problem I have found, I've been restarting the game several times, with my phone having 4G Signal Coverage of 2 bars at best, and it says ""Failed to Connect""! Please fix this! How is this happening to me?! This wasn't like this before. 4G Signal Coverage of 2 bars? Seriously?!"
pay to win
Fantastic game that is actually more intricate then meets the eye. There are many different characters to play with and despite the rarity system all of them can be used since there is no pvp gameplay in this. The story is great and only gets better and better as the writing gets more on par with a well written anime as you progress. There is also no need to have played any other Fate games or have watched any of the Fate anime adaptations but it would certainly make you like more characters!
I love the game play and the story in each chapter
Fun but watch your wallet.
"I'd be like if you makes player vs player mode! That will be more fun! unfortunately, i don't like the transfer way. it feels annoying when you should change transfer number every time you switch account because it just can be used 1 time"
Gacha hell but has great storyline and waifus
"The gacha rates are notoriously bad, but this game is very forgiving, giving out a decent amount of resources for the more difficult content for free"
Jpg of waifu makes me happy :^)
I love the game. Its a overall good anime game.
Gachahell
Why its not can be link in Google accounts
I can't open the game. It keeps closing the app I can't even make it to the title screen. I have a Galaxy S10. So it should work.
"I honestly love this game, the stories are interesting and fun, side quests offer more insight on certain characters and who doesn't love the events that always come out? My only negative things is that I cannot play it because of the Android 10 update. It's really disappointing too cause I was enjoying the Halloween event. It's sad seeing all these other people having the same issue. I'm slowly losing interest just because of all I'm missing out. Once fixed I will change my rating."
"Gacha madness for those who get used to the pain. Enjoyable leisure gameplay with interesting events but painful grinding process. Please increase Material drop rate because Gacha is not a lie, its yorokobe shounen salt mine. 10/10 getting ready for Lostbelts Servants. Train feels escalated up to 12."
"Great game and great story. Gameplay's alright. The relationship between fans and the dev team have been pretty rocky over the course of the games NA lifespan. However, the localization team has done far more to keep us updated in recent times and give fans an experience all our own while maintaining some staples from the original. All in all, a good job."
Amazing game! Highly recommend.
It is really good
The app doesn't open with Android 10
Very poggers would recommend
"I got this game a year and a half ago and play it alongside my sister. It's a blast for both of us! The story is well written and only gets better as it goes on, the events are frequent and engaging and the animations are breathtaking. Luck plays a part in getting rarer servants but its more than possible to excel in game with the 1-3 stars (who happen to be some of the best in game) and not spend a dime. Whether you're a fan of the series or not, Fate GO is definitely worth checking out."
Tamamo Cat
"Good story, combat system and graphics but bad gacha :("
"Fun, kinda roundabout on some things and sometimes the importance of leveling characters and whatnot aren't made apparent as to just how valuable they are. Still fun to me, even if the gacha percentages are straight garbage."
Really cool game
Great love it
"Enjoyable time waster, be careful putting money into it though, easy to spend more than you mean to."
"I really love this game, however, i cannot launch it right now. When i tap its icon to play it crashes and my phone says that it keeps on closing. Need your help with this."
"Personally, I knew nothing about Fate before playing this game (that was a mistake) but this game is fun. Even without knowing the franchise, I got enjoyment out of the units, draws, and story. In fact, because of this game I actually watched UBW and Zero (HF is next). My point is, this game is fun and explains just enough to a newcomer that it makes sense and is engaging."
It's fun and true enough to the source material.
"Game play is slightly on the slower side in the actual fighting, as there are very few ways to speed up Noble Phantasms (such as there being no way to completely skip the animations), so battle appears to be drawn out at times, but it's just the idea that this is the case. I must give this game a full 5 by 5 rating... The story is so well written, even an old man like me teared up at times. (Not enough room to say it all... Give this game a chance, it's in the top grade range.)"
Slower load times than a PS1 game. Gameplay is extremely boring RNG with the card command system. On top of all that it is grossly pay walled for exclusive servants with low gacha rates. Event grinding is a total slogfest which is almost mandatory because normal drop rates for progression are also abysmal. Just an overall pretty bad game in general with half baked mechanics that is actually a casino simulator.
Fun pass time
"Good, but gacha rate is terrible."
"Story and character design are great, and gameplay is just leisurely enough for you to multitask. Has great challenges, but also accomodating for beginners. Although gacha is hell here (as with every other gacha game), I'd recommend giving this a try."
It wont open
"Drop rates are pretty tragic but I still quickly fell in love with so many characters, gameplay is the right balance of easy to understand while requiring enough attention and strategy to be very engaging"
Perfect experience
I've gone too far in to pull out
"Guys, this game is a masterpiece, you enjoy storying while playing and it cant stop."
Great game that can be played for free. Though my connection to the servers can be a bit iffy
There was a matinence update and data got corrupted because the update didn't work
"I think its a lot of fun. Great artwork, I enjoy the combat, and the story overall as well as for individual character arcs. My one big gripe with the game is the grind for upgrade materials. Most of the grinding you do for materials will be through events because the drop rates seem so low everywhere else in the game that its almost not worth attempting. Its not impossible, its just annoying sometimes."
"Takes up the entirety of my phone storage, but worth it."
Only been playing two months and it really fun. You can grind really fast to level up and you can get servants fron history and the show. Plus the drop rates are amazing i already got ivan the terrible on my first ten pull outside of story of course.
Could use some performance improvements
The Gacha rate sucks but the storyline keeps me from playing. Pls continue on making good story for this game
I love this game and anime can you do fate grand order arcade
I love fate‚ù§
"An actually really good game that got me into Fate as a franchise. If you're a Fate fan, enjoy a good story (or like gambling on Waifus), this is a must play."
Waifu!‚ô•Ô∏è
Its hell
Best light novel game ever prepare to pay through your nose for good servants though
Still one of the best story driven mobile games.
"I've been playing this game for a few years, and it never fails to delete my data or be unable to recover it while games like dokkan and fire emblem heroes have flawless recovery options. I've spent time and money only for it to be for naught. Get better recovery that code recovery is so stupid."
Best game ever! Rate up isn't a lie. :> üëå Still playing since 11/28/18 :>
"Okay, let me edit this review after 3 years of playing. This is the only mobile game that I've kept on playing for a long time and am still enjoying even in my 3rd year. That already talks a lot about the game. Some mobile games that I've played, I only played for a year or a few months. This game might seem boring after a few months of grinding, but it's hard to drop because there's always fun to be had. As for those who're saying that this game is p2w, it's not. How can a PVE game be p2w??"
I've sold my soul to gacha for this game
F/GO is there when no one else was.
Godlike just needs auto play
this is good
"It's been 3 years and I'm still playing. I really like the characters and I got a lot that I like so not quitting any time soon. It's a good strategy game with very nice visuals. The icing on the cake for me is the story, which is very good. I'd say that getting people to play is hard especially the Fate uninitiates, since it lacks the ""nitro-charged action"" that most people go for and there is a lot of lore to sift through to be up to speed on the story."
Amazing game. Good story and the servants are fun. You can play without sinking a ton of money for in game currency despite what is said.
The game is good anytime anywhere i recommend the game
I just love this game
The best game on the play store
Fun when you have people to talk about it with
Fate salt order rate up is so fake but I still love it
"I came for Medusa, enjoyed many more waifus, stayed for the absolutely engrossing game lore and story progression"
"I dont understand why they cant upgrade their servers. You cant always connect everytime theres an update because they cant handle so much players traffic. Their customer supports sucks also, if you somehow lost your data, it will take them days just to send you bot reply and it will take another days just to figure out your account with 50-50 chance of recovery."
One of the best story gacha games . Sure the gacha is hell but unless you want your waifu you don't have to roll.
mashu best kouhai
"The best game there is .. It's not hard to Earn Saint Quarts, It's easy to understand, it has a unique and a large variation of character, Unique Gameplay...I Recommend this to all Players there.."
It's great. Fun story.
Too many servants to choose from and incredible storyline
"Not very F2P friendly, however it is a nice game in the Fate universe."
Best anime game ever!
Muh waifus
"Favorite game ever, once you play the game you'll get hooked with it. Watch the anime as well you will get hooked with it more."
"After installing, opening the game or opening from play store only opens my gmail to contact support. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same thing."
It was good
Np2 ivan baby!
Best gacha game yey
Great game however as long as I'm being honest remember it's a gatcha game also the process of getting items needed to summon isn't very rewarding.
Gacha life
"Story is great, sprites are top notch, famous jp voice actors and actresses. Sure the gacha rates might be on the low side but 5* servants aren't really necessary to beat the game, some of them do make the game a lot easier though and getting that 5* servant you always wanted might not come true but if you do get her/him it just makes the game so much better, the salt might also make you want to quit the game but once you become a veteran of the game, it doesn't really matter anymore. Try it."
Gouda story Gouda gameplay Gouda waifus Gouda game
Not a game
Greatüëçüëç
It's cool but I wish there was an auto bottom.
Gacha Hell for f2p without self control
very awesome game for fate fans~
Oh my God love the fuq out of it b/c I love it so much
Pretty good game but gacha rates is bad. The Story is awesome.
"I got my waifu jeanne, im happy *insert widepeepoHappy emote here*"
"honest review I play this games since beginning I understand how brutal this gacha rates which everyone in community agree but if ppl lucky enough they doesn't even need spend money or spend a little are enough, this games not competitive games so ppl still can play as F2P because SR and R or below can help progress through end games, CE are games changer for every servant playthrough. gameplay just simple so the main reason I play for collecting chara, Story, music and Arts. Plus MEME"
How to fix the Long loading It takes 2 or more minute to load
Still cannot play. When I try to launch the app it launches X-Plore from google app store. This has to be a bug on the side of Fate. After uninstalling X-plore I still cannot launch Fate. I am prompted with apps that can launch it. My options are email and gmail for some reason. The app is kinda broken. Error 43?
Not opening!
Sweet
"An amazing game with a great story, based on the highly acclaimed Fate Stay universe. Only problem is the gacha rates are atrocious (possibly the worst in any gacha game), but almost every battle is still winnable with teams of lower rarity servants anyway. A waifu collector at its core."
"Doesn't load on my phone at all, and takes waaaaay to long to load on my tablet, during the summoning process I closed the app and reopened it to save myself at least probably half an hour, I do have slow internet connection, but if you guys want players your ga,e should be ready for that."
Typical Fate's game -Free To Play player's Friendly -Good story & Sound design What bad is -Gameplay can be repeatitive sometimes -Gacha rate is the worst of all games i believe but its fine for me
the game is great! the story is great! <3 Gilgamesh! I wish I could play my account also in other devices. I can only play my account in one device which sucks when I want to play it on my tablet next because my phone is charging
"The Game is really good, lets you feel the bliss of achievement and hardwork. The event are entertaining and the story mode is over-the-top. I'll just leave few suggestions. Receiving blaze of wizdom during log-in are way to absurb, i should recommend giving us apple instead due to the fact that the longer the game the higher AP it consumes.."
"1a. Increasing 5* rates will make people summon more. Just look at Dokkan Battle. 1b. Step banners with guaranteed featured unit will have the same impact. 1c. Making the prices of the Crystals cheaper will make people purchase more. 2. After a few years, the ui and menu seems outdated. Updating it will make it look fresh and exciting. 3. Make Crystals easier to obtain via log in, celebrations, etc. Other than that, this game is tip top."
"Gatcha stuff aside, game should have NP skip for farming QoL. Nobody want to sit around farming for 2+ hour looking at the same NP animation for a billion time. Also, 3x gameplay speed and 1/2 current AP cut on dailies is highly appreciated."
App won't even open for 3 seconds going to leave at 1 star until fixed
The gaming portion is not well designed. Good story but horrible getcha rate. Fan service game overall.
"It's a pretty good game, but it's relatively slow at times and having to choose a support is kind of lame. I gave up after that. Good game otherwise."
Doesnt even start........
I've been playing since Sept 2019 and lucky i got 11 SSR i love this game. . I love Fate Universe .
I would have given it a 5 star but the game doesnt function at times even tho its updating anything but other than that its good and slightly addictive
"If I could, I would honestly give this game a negative rating. I usually have patience when it comes to rerolling for a specific unit. However, if the game constantly crashes because of communication errors, the banner is only up for 24 hours, and the summoning rates are so bad to the point that it seems rigged, I can really say that it doesn't have any potential to be a fun game at all. I would think there would be at least some compensation for the servers crashing but of course not."
"I love this game to death. I'm addicted to gacha games but FGO has centralized my addiction. That said, I have a suggestion. Plenty of people, myself included have accidentally burned servants or CE's we didn't mean to. What I suggest is a system that allows ths return of previously summoned CE's or Servants. Have a system in place that allows them to reclaim that unit at least once as long as there's no copy of the unit in their archive or inventory. Also make its resource cost based on stars."
This game is fun and cool ‚òÄÔ∏èüîÖ‚òÄÔ∏è
"Great game. Lovable characters, enjoyable story. The gacha elements aren't intrusive and free servants van get you through the story just fine. Grindy events can feel tiring after awhile, but that's part of thr gacha formula."
Pengeee 5s na servant
"The gacha system on this game is hot garbage. It is also way to grinding with no payoff. Gameplay is average paper, rock, scissors style. Only good thing about it is the characters but good luck to get anyone you want because summons are both characters and essence which lower chances of getting characters. This game is greedy and kinda boring. There are better games than this. I hate the drop rates in this avoid this game play anything else"
There are less predatory mobile games out there that have more content.
"It's Fate, need I say more?"
It's fate
Very nice game. A fan of Fate series all the way. But the Gacha rates suck...
My favorite game of all time... despite being a fan of Fate franchise...I wish they added a pvp system..
I have a gambling addiction with anime girls.
This game is a game that you have to play to enjoy. The more time put in you get more out of it remember to have screenshots of your account info and if and stuff because if you delete you lose your stuff
It's very good üëå
"Alot of fun, the animation is amazing!"
"I'm a fan of the franchise so i'm a bit biased here. I love the game, love the story and love the animation. Yes the gacha can be frustrating but its part of the fun. I wont reccomend the game for people who are not intrested to invest time in the game because for me it is addictive."
"I have been playing this game for 2yrs now, there are some days that this game is really a pain in the butt but there are also days that this game makes me really happy and i injoyed it. Over all this game is making you feel tired because of the game system but it also makes you feel great that you played and raised your servants to full power. Thanks for creating this game for us xD."
I like the story line and the characters and the graphics
"Simply love this game and everything that Fate as a series is! Consider me hooked on the story, events, and characters! Even had an issue with my game and couldn't get my account back until the support team came through for me, simply awesome! I can't wait to get more of my favorite servants and enjoy the simple yet complex gameplay! With great characters and a system that's friendly to f2p players, you have a game that other developers should take notes from! Thank you for this great game!"
"This game has consumed my life, My marriage is in shambles, my wife took the kids, I got fired from my job and my parents wont look me in the eye. Best game"
Former JP server player transferred to EN server when it came out. This is one of the few top notch mobile game you will ever find. 1. Plenty of story (if you are a fan of the Fate Series and Light Novel type games) 2. Simple Game Mechanics (easy learning curve) 3. No intrusive and abusive ADs (just pure raw gameplay) *edited my review in lieu of the recent Lostbelt Update (since now EN server is catching up to JP server content release/s)
The experience is good it is just the graphics and why do the characters have too be so small
Nice game but this e-luck on summon is so annoying! JP server will give you over a hundred of saint quartz everyweek in daily login. This server is just so annoying.
GIVE ME TIAMAT!!!!!! PLEASE I'M BEGGING YOU!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
5/5 cant escape this hole the moment i jumped in it 2 years ago
"It's pretty good, the gacha is life."
"I love the game! Nice graphics, nice story nice sound effects üëçüòç"
"Short review: Great art, good sound and story..... And prepare to drop your wallet in lava for gacha"
It's really fun
Its amazing
Rate up is still a lie.
"Very money grabbing, but the story is amazing"
"I really like this one since I am a fan of Type Moon works (Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero, Fate/Apocrypha, Kara no Kyoukai, Tsukihime, Fate/Grand Order, etc.). Only thing I don't like is the Transfer Number thing. Wish it was binded with Google or other cloud storage services. The gacha system might be a little unfair sometimes. But overall this is one of my favorite games ever. By the way, it's completely ridiculous the fact this version is delayed TWO YEARS from the Japanese version."
Nice ez gacha
"Love the characters & story, but gameplay is mindlessly grindy. I love tha Fate franchise and tried many times to like this game but its just too repetitive. The slow loading time doesn't help either."
"Story is great, of course, it's written by Kinoko Nasu himself... Well except for Septem. I'm a fan of Nasuverse and like the concepts and mechanics of it. Graphics are not really terrible, but you need to update the animations of several outdated Servants, for example Ushiwakamaru(Rider) Gameplay... Too much grinding but it's rewarding, and you don't actually need five stars to win, though it's a bonus. Many free four stars are OP, can rival the five star and sometimes you can get them for free"
"Honestly one of the best and consistent games I've ever played. Had loads of content and the storyline was really good. Also, very beginner friendly. Highly recommend this to any fan of the Fate series."
Entertaning and fun tu play
"FGO is good civilization. Seriously though, it's a pretty solid game despite its simplicity. My only issue with it is how long it takes for the story to get interesting (the writing early on is pretty mediocre). When the story finally gets going though, it's fantastic. I also dislike how limited the soundtrack is. Even without farming, I quickly grew tired of it and opted to play my music in the background instead."
This is a nice game for all the Fate Series fans. I love it
game lol ... SQ it vcc
it would be better if the players could switch servants they didn't want with other players
"As a Fate fan, I love this game and the servants. Story line is pretty great too. Gacha always sucks but this one is worth it imo"
Only problem is events that don't let you play them
"Everyone should play this game. Saint quartz should be cheaper and 5* rates should be higher. I've easily spent over $1000 in my 3 years of play, and while I have a very well rounded team, I find very few people are willing to invest as much as I have to achieve similar results... Obviously it doesn't make it that difficult to do challenges seeing as there is no PvP, but still. Everyone should be able to roll their waifu."
"I just love this game. Nothing really more to say I'm a big fan of the anime, I love the storylines, and the events"
"It's awesome, you get to make you're team of servents like you were in one of the animes, but sometimes you run out of quartz before you get that servent you want. It's not pay to win but I wish there were more quartz."
"Story is great, but the gameplay is basic."
Always been a great game from when i lost my first 4 accounts. Lol. But the strategic gameplay is really gd. Just a fun game if you are into jrpg's. And the nasu verse keeps expanding on the game. Thats awesome.
Please just give me a FGO specific credit card.
The gacha rate is suck but the gameplay and the story is very interesting
"Cute girls, rate up is a lie tho"
Very very very very goos
"You either die a free to play, or live long enough to see yourself become a whale."
We like it it good battle and fun quest
It's very interesting game where you can explore the lore and myths of the world. It's not boring its very fascinating to be precise.
Very fun but low gatcha rates
"It's gotten so much more interesting as the story goes on. The gameplay is fun but what really gets to me is the characters, they are wonderful and i love them all"
Simple gameplay but with a great story. Perfect casual gacha.
"Come for the action & gameplay, stay for the waifus and gacha!"
"Amazing game, but avoid spending at all costs. Still the drop rate after years makes people avoid this game, but you can play with freebies anyway."
Crazy fun.
Ruined my life.
"Amazing story, especially if you are familiar with the Nasu verse...or Fate series in general. The servants are amazing, gameplay is simple with some depth if you are looking to become more effective. Gatcha is unforgiving, though luckily you can get by on events servants and decent 3 stars."
"Love the fate series, love this app. Not a huge fan of gatcha games anymore (a little burnt out) but this is easily the best one by far."
It's fun and the problem before had been fixed
Gacha is Bad Civilization!!!
Initially I hated this game but after 2 years I think I finally understand how to play Fate: Grind Order
Great story. Exceptional gameplay.
"There's a reason I've played this game for 3 years without breaks, and it's definitely not gacha addiction. The story and characters in this game are some of my favorite in any game, period. This game really knows how to invest you with its story."
I love game!
Fun game but the Gacha rates is trash
The gatcha is trash but you'll get used to it
"The Gacha rate here can kill you and it's expensive to whale. But if you like the Fate series, this is good as it gets on mobile."
Besy game
i simply love the game plus the servants and especially all of its story and events. The graphics are simple but good though it really is sad on the gacha part. This is the most hardest gacha game ive ever played. You cant really have that feeling of certainty that you'll get the servants you want but that flaw could not beat how the story is very good and events makes it even better especially those welfare servants.
Good :)))
To all those that are planning to play this game I say to you: Thats hell you're walking into
Fun. Entertaining. Gives a sense of accomplishment. Easy to learn. Educational. Good story.
Is really good in every aspect but summoning material distribution. Solid game 7.5 outta 10
SALT!!!
Worst game ever
Karna is so hot
Make use of what you have Pray to RNG to pull your Favorite Use Quartz wisely
"Good story and relatively simple gameplay but the gacha rate is horrendous. On top of that, the game can be very grindy with events."
"This game is absoulte BS but I cant stop myself on playing this. Fate GO is one of the best Gacha games I have ever played, the rates make me want to cry but it gives me more than enough reason to go back out and get more quartz to see if I can get it again. The combat is amazing, it is so simple to understand and it doesnt feel clunky as hell. The story is actually quite good, after fuyuki the story really kicks off."
Ex...carliber
"Great game, but the pricing for Saint Quartz is ridiculous. I've been F2P all this time but if you lower it I'd definitely start buying."
goodgame
Gacha salt is addicting
A very good game where you can progress in the story with just using low level type of servants even without using higher tier type of servants you can still progress in the story without difficulty~
"Best game with the best waifus. This should be 10 star but meh, Playstore only have 5."
The best game of all Gacha Games!!!!
I like the Fate series.
Salty But Heathy ( best game hands down )
FATE WAIFUS ARE WORTH INFINITE AMOUNTS OF MONEY
"I love this droprate, droprate is lie"
Great stories for the weeb in us all
Craft Essence simulator.
Oh just an app that brings you back in the screen.........im out
Couldn't play
"Easy to understand gameplay that requires minimal attention, perfect for filling time during other activites. Good writing with lovable and detestable characters."
"The only issue I have with this game is that it's sometimes really hard to get new characters. This has an upside though, since when you do get a new character it's super rewarding/exciting. So it still gets 5 stars from me."
"Will never start, tried to uninstall and reinstall 3 times and no help. Galaxy S9 plus with most up to date software"
Little girls should not be sexualized like this.
Mesh for the game the general loading so slow and tried it in phone and tablet and everything take like gd min or more for load up kinda odd for game been out for long time.
Good game but acquiring units is the worst part on me.
"Its ONLY redeeming factor is turn based combat. Still art is only thing decent. *edit* This game still has no binding feature. Do NOT spend money on this game. I've lost access to my account twice now (update related reset), they restored it once, they also indicate if you change your device (whether upgrading or failure forced) they are not going to restore your account. They'll take your money with no promise to continue allowing you access to their services. That's theft in my book."
Game won't open. Crashes on startup and directs me to my email app to send a report instead.
When i finished the 600 mb download the game was good and i enjoyed it but in the next day the game lost all it's files and need to download the files again for another 600 mb and that means i'm just wasting my data for for a game that has a risk for losing it's own files
"Very bad Gacha rate, didn't get Quetzalcoatl Rider class"
Can't open the game
"A Pay to win game, if you dont have a lot of money then you wont probably have the opportunity to get those 5 star heroes. The gacha drop rates are awful. Play the game called Epic Seven instead in which the gacha rates are better."
Why can't I play my saved data? I have my transfer data saved but it wouldn't let me play. It always says that I have the incorrect transfer number/password
Wish it had a multiplayer mode.. I want to fight my friends
I have lost 3 accounts with this transfer number system. Says it keeps being used when i have the only number. If this can be fixed let me know
Please update the friend's support servant before the quest begins. Why you don't show all friends but just a few of them? The update friend list button doesn't help much so please update the friend's support servant list
"Great game and story, but its extremely slow to load in between battles."
"Good game. My issue is that once I exit the game, I can no longer enter again. It keeps saying my connection is slow but I have fast internet for other applications."
Game is alright but dont expected get great characters in it. The game has the worst rates to acquire a 4* letalone a 5* character where you can use over $500 worth of gems and acquire none.
"Dumb summoning rates, GOOD EXAMPLE OF PAY TO WIN GAME"
"The game won't open, it directs me to my gmail app"
One of my favorite games
"Honestly a solid game. Visuals and gameplay are considerably simple, but it leads to an addicting experience. Gacha is a love/hate relationship; low rarity units and free event units, along with friends units, are enough to get you through the main story and probably post-game, but for those that want unique or powerful characters, the gacha is your worst nightmare. My main complaint for this game is general lack of end game content; beyond events and slow story additions, there's nothing to do"
"Fun game to play...but... Summoning sucks, all you get is useless craft essences. Getting heros with a 10 pull from 30 Quartz is next to impossible even with drop rate increases. Takes awhile to get 30 Quartz and they reward you with 10 cards (no matter the number of stars) that will never be used"
Getcha rate up is lie
"Awesome, although this is my first FGO game but I've already love the story,gotta see other work from the series..."
Hey everyone! If you install then reinstall you can clean a lot of space! Like 3Gb BUT get the transfer number first.
Doesn't even open :/ disappointed because I love the Fate franchise
Great characters and voice over
Not the Fate I wanted. Where is my OG game? Perfect for these mobile devices
False drop rates. Waste of money. Nearly 500 summons and 1 five star servant. Not a single 4 star Saber and performed 10 x 10 summons during a Sabers ONLY event. Better odds at a casino. The game author should be ashamed with what they are doing.
"The account binding for this is awful, I wish that that you guys just stick with the fb acc binding and google acc binding, I only use 1 phone to use the account that I'm playing, and guess what? it says that the transfer number is in used eventhough I'm the only one who is using my own account, either way, I'm not gonna play this again, I already progressed a lot in this game, but I lost my account already just because of a stupid data transferring, great job FGO"
"Doesn't work on my phone. Tried it multiple times over the years. Contacted devs, no support on the issue so they clearly don't care. I'll be sure to avoid any of their games in the future as well."
May i just ask one thing Ummm How can i get my account data back because my data id is not available or is being used said by a dialog box plss help how to retrieve it back.thanks
"Love the game but can no longer play it due to it crashing on launch. Restarting app, clearing the cache, and reinstalling it does not resolve this issue"
It's so amazing
"Love the characters and the art design. But end-game is ridiculously grindy and repetitive. The challenge quests (obstensibly to offer challenge and critical thinking) are really just tests to see if you have one or several of the most top tier characters in the game e.g. Merlin and Waver, and don't even offer any challenge if you do. CQ's are undoable without these rate servants. Story is poorly written or translated, with drawn out dialogue. Gacha rates are extremely poor with little F2P SQ."
"I can't seem to open my account. It was working well yesterday. Now it doesn't open, and I haven't put a code up so I cant uninstall/reinstall. And I have worked hard for that acc. Please help."
Gacha master yorokobe shonen blessed me lately so ill give a high rating just dont give me Rank E luck anymore :^(
"Hands down not what i expected in a good way, end up playing this alot more each day"
I've been f2p since day one. Grinding in this game does require a lot patience when farming accention materials. Though this game may not be for everyone due to the low drop rates which is expected from a generic gatcha. The story is okay but can get boring. The gatcha has extremely low drop rates which can be a pain in the ass when attempting to get a 5 star or 4 star jpeg wafu. I didn't need to use a single brain cell to understand gameplay mechanics and its fun. It should be easy for noobs.
Still trying to understand fate series using this app but ok
Just like the anime
Gachaaa Hellll!!!!
This funny little asian man sure knows how to cook up a good tune..... 10/10 with the agony of not getting some dumb white dude with a cloak getting harrassed by an albino squirrel
I loved this game until one week my app was bugged and sent me back to square one. I had the servants I wanted and was gaining ground on the story and the game updated and wiped my progress.
Loading time is too long for my oppo a3s phone
"A fun and simple game for a Type-MOON fan. Yes, the in-game economy can overwhelm a player if they are not careful, but that's unfortunately the nature of the video game industry in this generation. Yes, I do not have every available playable unit offered, but I have enough, and I still find myself enjoying the game and the events. If I miss something, then oh well. There's no point agonizing over it. This game is a good way to pass the time. I'd recommend it to others."
"The game is really great, the storyline was suprisingly very interesting and the gameplay was easy to learn. I am really impress with the character developments, and hoping there will be more servants to play with."
"A very fair game for F2P players, nice story and good gameplay"
"Game is great. Story is awesome (not all of it, mind you. Looking at you Septem and Agartha). System is not too complex, and the game regularly rewards you. Artwork are top-notch, and the graphics and animations are all very well done. This game definitely set itself apart from other Gacha games which merely uses chibified sprites of their characters. Though you're more likely going to win the lottery or get hit by a lightning on your birthday than getting a single freaking SSR."
Absolutely greatest game ever
"Fate ""Grind"" Order"
To much grind and lag ... Put automate form.
Can't believe such a big name game doesn't any have type of cloud saving.
great farming materials :v
I don't like the unfair percentage rate of summon in this game because I can't get the unit that I want and I myself is a regular player not a pay to play player so it is a disadvantage especially when receiving games to summon. So please fix your system to make fair for regular players
"Easy-to-Learn and master Gameplay Mechanics, interesting Plot, good Visuals, good Audio, but uses age-old Graphical User Interface, lacks Social Features commonly available in other modern mobile game titles, and lacks Endgame Contents once the Official Campaign has been cleared."
Awesome and fun
"first impression sucks; load times are longer than any mobile game has a right to be, and this game is too noisy to not have the volume settings available right at the start before gameplay even begins. needing to have this app the active window for the initial big download is also questionable"
Great fun easy to play
Artoria and Mordred best girls
"Love the game and the lore, natrually feels a bit grindy and takes a large chunk of time to get your favorite servants to maximum level and bond. Rate up is a lie, but every servant is viable in their own way, so that's okay. Graphics are amazing, some animations can feel outdated, though they are frequently updated which makes me happy. Over all a great app and worth your time if you are a fan of the Fate Universe."
"SCREW THIS!! Customer cant even find my account, why? BECAUSE THEY NEED ALL THE INFORMATION ON THE ACCOUNT! Thing is, if i knew the transfer number and information on my account, do you think I'd be contacting this sorry support service."
"Other franchise improve along the years but there are some like this one that just doesn't in any aspect you can think of - events, summoning gachapon, premium currency, daily logins. The only thing that this game did good is their character drawings or maybe I should credit the artist instead."
"Seriously I played for 4 months and the gacha rates are seriously rigged. Pull Multi 34 times in Arthur's banner, never get him at all. While some players flaunt in screenshots they got 2 Arthur in a single multi roll. The in game purchase is overpriced when the gacha rates is so low and rigged. I recommend new 7DS to anyone who wants good storyline, and better gameplay and graphic. The Ultimate animations feel like watching anime. And guaranteed SSR after failed to get one after 5 Pulls."
"I really love this game, but I do have some issues with it. It can get very draining as it is 90% grind/farming. Back to back grindy events make it super exhausting at times. It's also not very F2P friendly. It's possible to be F2P, but it's very difficult, especially since drop rates are horrible and there's no summoning failsafe. These aren't game breaking problems, but they're problems some people may rightfully not want to deal with. Fixing them could potentially increase revenue."
quite a forgiving game. and as a free to play player with quite moderate luck i must say that this has been really enjoyable.. i mostly just try collect the few servants and CEs i want. and honestly i dont have the ones i want the most either xD
Eyyyyyyyyyyy
App waiting for download fyi
"Hell yeah all 5 cyclinders. Well 1.5. The gacha system and pay to win certain things mechanics are kind of a bust, but with this being such a wide range game and making it easy to restore mission points it kinda balances out more or less. So GJ. but Fix That Srsly."
"I've always been a fan of the fate series. I tried to play the JA version with martha and Gil-Kun but it would always lag. I'm so happy they finally released the NA . All of the audio is ""subbed"" and much like the VN this game tells it's stort through written dialogue and the ocassional secret and subbed voice line. If your someone who is like my friend and doesn't like subbed text you can hit the skip botton to move onto the gameplay. It tends to be more enjoyable if you know the stort behind t"
A beautiful time killer and a great way to get interested in history. :-)
Overall super great game I loved this as much as I loved the anime. However it's not that big of a deal but I feel like the player puts in more effort for less reward again super great game I truly do love it.
"Repetitive with long loading times. It is a great game otherwise, and the writing is fantastic."
Fun and immersive game. Do yourself a favor and watch some tutorials before fully jumping into your game. It will save you time and make the experience so much better.
"Not f2P friendly, no re-playability of the story. If they allowed more difficulties after you finish each singularity( I started the game mid September of last year, finished all singularities early December) game got boring after that. There was reward for playing much after that besides some nice events,. But if they would let us play the story again and gain sq's from playing each difficulty for each singularity that would make this a 7/5 game!!!!."
"Its a very fun game with lots of strategy, action, animation/art and it's hard to come by these types of gacha games!"
Wonderful and fun game. Never been displeased
Love the game a great time killer decent story and not to bad if you feel like dropping some cash completely optional though
fun not overly addictive but sure too entertain you and bring you back its difficultly is dependent on your ability to use your servants to the best of your abilities even 2 star servants can finish the boss's if you use your head and raise them well
"I really want to give this App a 5 star bc I have so much fun with this game. I love the story, style of play, and plot. After a recent survey the did a lot better of allowing players gathering Saint Quarts, and paying AP to do the story. (However, I want that to also to apply for stregnthening your servents when farming embers...). Spending Saint Qaurts to pull for servents is more of a miss than it ever is a hit. They to impliment a pitty pulls for those who cant get 4* or 5* servents."
"This game is fantastic, absolutely love it! EDIT: 9 months later and still stand by my original review! If only RNG loved me in other games as much as here..]:"
It is awsome
Hard to unlock stuff
This is GaChA HELL
"Love this game, just wish I had more luck"
I love this game! So glad i was able to summon Gilgamesh and beable to be by his side for years to come!
"Fun game, great for any fan of the Fate franchise."
Give me cuzerker you villain
Nasu has created a lovely universe to tell his story.
It good but still need more boy.
Canonical
Awesome game that complements their hard grind with compelling story and likely characters. Hopping we get the possibility in the future to obtain old welfare servants without having to use Rare Mana Prisms.
Thanks for adding back Android 10 support! Glad to be playing again! :D
Best mobile gacha there is. No competition at all.
Great game!!! Totally worth playing!! Its not really pay to win games it you just need good luck to get strong servants.. and i really like the support system!! Totally helps us newbies to rise and have a good experience!! I really recoomend trying this game!! Totaly worth it and addicting
enjoyable
"If you're looking for a game with blatant pedophilia, sexism, and transphobia that is all called ""fanservice"" look no further! I've been playing this game for a little under a year now, and I've hit a breaking point. Nearly every single female servant (INCLUDING THE CHILD ONES) are dressed in barely anything. Frequently, the child servants are dressed LESS than the adult ones (looking at you, Wu Zetian, Jack, and Jeanne Santa Alter)."
Pay to win... . . .make np skipable and give me more jalter
I love this game loading screen is a bit long but one of my favorite game i had on my phone in a long time
"Grindy Gameplay, Awful Customer Support, and Terrible Design. On top of the game itself being just a massive grind, the gacha being very bad in terms of your chance of getting anything good, and the overpriced cost of saint quartz. This game uses a terrible data transfer code system rather than an account system, which ensures that if you lose your device you have almost no way to recover your account since their customer support is completely unhelpful. Lackluster game made by terrible company."
I mean I like it lol.
Is good if you get what you want and I find the story and events quite interesting and fun. This game requires a lot of your time
"Really enjoy the game, it can be fun and addicting, only down side is it's a freaking money vampire and most players have Lancer Luck."
It's great as long as you dont mind getting shafted when you summon
Can't really say anything I'm just a fan of the fate series thx for really making this game
"It has great graphics, I love the story, and the gameplay is smooth"
You can beat the Game using Only low star servant even though I dont have a SSr servant and a Good story.
game is good . nice animation and lore.. loading is too slow that makes me feel sleepy XD and sometimes i cant log in instantly because of my slow net.. anyways nice game.
"Many hundreds of hours played passively, so obviously I'm a huge fan."
Best story on the gacha game market once you get to Camelot but the combat is seriously dated and gacha rates harsh.
"Super dope game EVEN BETTER when you know about the characters and anime. So go watch them, they're great stories with hella action."
Kiara is very delicious
Good game but summon rates a garbage. I've literally dropped like $100 and still can't summon a 5* don't waste your time if you wanna badass team. Update: I actually have ex luck now so it's a pretty good gameüòÇlmao
Good time killer but ffs why you gotta give me 2 5 stars that I don't giv a damn about instead of 1 girl I really like
Simple and fun
Its one of the best games I have ever played
Please give me astolfo saber and rider I gave 5 star rating
one star cuz Spartacus is one star
"Good game, but the RNG is cancer"
"Saving humanity a whole slew of amusing, anime takes of legendary Heroes. Insane story. Free to play if you don't get caught up with ""I have to have this hero"""
Greatest game I have ever played !!!!! My only issue is that if you break your phone and get a new one the code to transfer your data can only be used once..
Only mobile game I played for 3 years(soon) and counting
Worth your time if you love the anime and the game
Amazing game so much fun only issue I have is the transition to Camelot from the previous singularity it's quite a big jump and I feel the difficulty should be lowered just a little bit so it's hard but not as hard but other than that it's a great game an easy 5/5 stars from me keep up the great work
Goood game i rate 4/5
Great Game!!!
"They fixed the login chain issue. The game is a great time sink. You van pay, but you can earn premium currency through gameplay too."
"I hate it, but i love it"
"Love the game, fun quests and characters, and not overly Grindy if you know what to do"
"This game is pretty bad, if you're going to play it for the summons. Summons rates are bad, too much stuff in the summon pool that new servants are rarely obtainable. Definitely not new player and f2p friendly. Definitely not a gacha worth investing in for trying to summon for your favorite heroic spirit."
"After being F2P for nearly two years, I can testify to its abyssmal summon rates, especially for SSRs. The summon rates are often the most cited problem with the game, and a reason for why many end up dropping it altogether (among others). The game isn't built or designed for get-powerful-quick schemes. It rewards you for dedication, persistence, and a little bit of luck, over time. And the rewards are sweeter when you work for it. (also when they give you free tickets, ofc) 9/10 game, buff Herc"
"Despite of bad rate, this game is worth to play with great story"
"I've been playing for about a year now and i can say that I love this game! I'm not really into mobile games but I find it hard to stop playing. The game has a wonderful story, fun gameplay, addicting gacha, and frequent updates! I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking to get into mobile games or if you're a fan of the Fate anime series like me."
Really needs a better account binding system.
"Underwhelmed, I'm using an s10e and it won't even start. I like the anime, the app ahs left me wanting."
"Rates are bad, like, horrible but...the content is beatable with f2p units...you play this for the Story/characters not the gameplay ."
So cool but some times its anoiys me for some resoun it hard to get 5 star heros but over all its good
"After few months, i change my opinion on the game, its style, story, and its events are really great, bringing in that nostalgic feeling when you play the game first time and like it. I could rate it five, but gacha trash pervents me. So here is a four. P.s. i could of rate it 4.5 but no option."
"i open the game then an my email try to send in fgo , the hell"
"Best gacha games, their story are awesome unlike most gacha games. High quality waifus/husbandos too."
God civ
If only the game didnt care about censor
Interesed game
1 rolls are better than 10x
"Brutal gacha rates, no guarantee or pity pull in any way. Bad event that cause you to miss out on everything if you missed just one login. Even though the character card art is nice, the gacha and the events is pretty bad overall. Play this game ONLY if you can tolerate not getting your favourite even if you save for 6 months. Else find other game. This game will definitively break your heart since the game does not give you much summoning currency."

Stingy mats and very very low ssr rate. Stay away from this game
From ADSw with love
"Vote ded, trash gem, 400sq no eresh üò¢"
"If you miss one thing during an event or you're a new player, good luck. Not only is it incredibly difficult for a new player to get into the game but things that you've missed will also rarely return, no more how important it is or how badly you wanted a welfare character/character costume."
Worst game I ever played the update is so slow
The game crashes as soon as it opens.
Awesome game. Gives the fan base what it wants as well as gamers
Game lags too much and the screen blacksout/freezes often.
I can't open the game plz fix it
Very epic
It was ok at first but now all of a sudden the game crashes the moment that I try to load it up what's going on
Would have been better if you implemented a recovery system similar with azur lane or other gacha games where in you bind your account to your email. Its less hassle a guarantee that your data is secured unlike your worthless data transfer code
Gacha rates are horrendous compared to games out there. 800+ SQ and nothing. No pity no nothing.
Good historyüòä
Really fun. Period point blank.
Still waiting for you to reply to me why i cant play fgo everytime i open the game it just closes how the heck can you plunder my cold hard cash if you wont help me solve this problem
Love the show hope the game is good
doesnt even open
"It is fun game especially if you know a little bit about the lore, and if you or curious of each or some of the charters past are changed from ours. The gaxh system is very mix between okay and unforgiving but that most the fun when you save 200 quart(the gem currency) and you get 2 to 3 copies of a card, or none at all. The beginning is really easy then the start to make it slightly difficult by adding gimets that if you have the right rsources can just be annoying."
Dogshit
"Gameplay wise it's alright, Gacha wise the game can be very VERY unfair when it comes to SSR drop rates. But if you don't want to spend a penny on this game and can get through all of the exp grind for your units you might enjoy this game like I have. But sometimes it's good to look at it from the perspective of a player who has played many kinds of gacha games. FGO is a good choice if you don't have anything else to play, as long as you remember to issue a transfer code when you're done."
Cannot connect even after multiple restarts and downloads
"Anyone who says CE aren't relevant to the gameplay obviously has never tried a MLB Black Grail, or a Gudaguda poster girl."
It's great for the fans
Downloaded many times but can't open app.
This game managed to re-connect me with my childhood friend. TWO THUMBS UP ! üëçüëç - Ricky
Wish we were equal to jp
"Great game, but maybe get rid of the screen turming off when ita not being touched"
A powerful investment that i still enjot
"the game feels so iffy for me, very slow loading, bland themes and the content production for me is really slow, this game has great potential for being greater (well it is a fate franchise) but as where this game stands it might not be greater but just great so much to improve on, i still have hope that this game will become greater than it is rn"
Gaccha hell but amazing story
Destin Destani Detesin Desityn has a wide inventory of course clairo we can all wet desire looking at last night's episode in this case of Capacha C'peachsix which is witchcraft shehimniol is SKELETOR for Mummiaya Datanyo Briattanya.fun at Recesses .carrara burk Reece Paramount Chivas overtime apples ovations over
Best mobile game ever yes the rates arent the greatest but at least lower rarity servants can actually be used effectively and if youre patient and save saints quartz youll build up enough for a 5 star in no time
Improve Friend List pls
"Game is alright for fans of the series, but as a game itself it feels outdated compared to other mobile games. Graphics are 2d characters with simple animations. No auto battle of any kind which wouldnt be so bad except for the mass amounts of grind to upgrade 1 character, due to both low drop chances combined with materials that can only be farmed on a specific day. Typical stamina system to limit playtime. And overall nothing to really do unless you like the story they came up with."
Enjoy tge amount of servants and historical figures you get as well.
Frustrating and fun
Gangster
The game is really amazing
Good time passer
Does not work. It only crashes upon boot up
A fun gacha game
It was amazing I hope you come out with anastasia real soon I look forward to playing it
Wheeeeeeeeeee
Too money grubbing
"Excellent game all around. Amazing story, great graphics, constant events and of course beautiful art. Love the game, would highly recommend."
Great game for my opinion
Love it!!
im broke but that is alright
That gacha rate though
Nasu-kun is top tier waifu
Very easy to play the game simple bottons just you need a strategy
"Compared to other gacha games the low rarity units in this game are actually useful and, combined with useful welfare rare units one doesn't need to spend money on the game to progress. A lack of pvp is refreshing and puts more focus on story."
I love the series and the game.
"My favorite gacha game. I've been playing since it started. The only problem is that the probabilities are very unfair, but when it hits, it hits great."
"Downloaded, okay. Go to open the stupid thing and it jumps to trying to open my email? Uninstalled FOREVER! Lmao. Losers."
A amazing game
I liked it. Just wish I had better luck.
fun game like how alot the characters from the series are in it and a few new ones. graphics are on point and over all just a fun game. Only down side is the rating chances on new stronger charcters.
I love it! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Waifus are life
Orderly
Great story and a game
This is one of the most addictive games i have ever played and its super worth it but I suggest you should put a faster koading on screen and some trading to your friends to be fun but overall this game is super worth it to download
I love the game! üòç
"I love the game, but hate my gacha luck"
Best Horror Game.. Especially the Gacha.. It's Heart Stopping.
i love the the game because of the story
"The phrase ""its just a gacha game"" is such a f2p mindset. You are ok with the no pity system, low SSR rate, incompletion of the servantdex. When you stop getting angry after min rolls, you've lost twice. There's always more quartz to earn, and always a credit card for desperation. Never settle"
Best game ever but it'll ruin your life
Its great for people who praises the Fate franchies
Crashes on launch 100% of the time. Just goes straight to sending support an email. Pretty bad when the game won't even start on its first play. Seems to be a very widespread issue. Pretty hard to get new players that way. :/
100% crash rate. Unable to start the game on multiple devices. Same issue in 2020.
Don't recommend at all. The pool of characters is so diluted now with hundreds of characters and what seems like thousands of craft essences. This game does its best to make you feel like you need to fork over another 25 usd for another 10 roll just so you can have a chance at getting a somewhat decent character. More likely you'll get a CE. The game is fun if you get the good characters and the story can be neat. But it just sucks when you save hundreds of quartz and get nothing useful.
It's Golden Experience.
Super awesome üëç
I hate gacha.
"The biggest issue with this game is the amount of grinding required to get the quarts, then when you use them your rare summons are craft essence 9 out of 10 times. This needs to be fixed, I dont need or want craft essence, I want new servants. The drop rates for craft essence are over double that of servants and that needs to change."
Good game. Needs English voicing. Alot of farming though. Poor Gatcha rate.
"Updated, still force closes immediately."
I like it game fate grand order
"Good game, needs to be more player friendly"
A cool gatcha game that play different from most other games on mobile. The only problem I have is the tediously long loading times.
"I would love to give this a higher rating, but every load screen takes like 15 to 20 minutes so I didnt even get to the actual game."
It Keeps Kicking Me Out Of The Game So I Cant Play...
"Game can be fun, but it can really suck the joy when you save up your Quartz for a rare summon and don't get what you want. All in all the game has a good story and characters, but the MOBA aspects really make or break the experience."
History waifus. Nuff said.
"What can I say, I'm a fate fan... Though damn RNG, sigh~*"
"Graphics, gameplay, and story are amazing in my opinion. But that 1% chance to get a good char and the fact that grinding for saint quarts is tedious and potentially resourse intesive w/o one just makes that fact worse. Plus you're only garenteed 1 3 star or higher char with a 10x summon that cost 30 saint quarts. Literally the best way to grind w/o a 5 star char is just to log in consistently. It sucks that this is the case, but sometimes that's how the cookie crumbles"
This game is really awesome!!!
The best and awsome game eveerrrrrrre...
"Disappointed. It's a great game don't get me wrong but It is unforgiving with login bonuses and feels like you're not being given any reward because you only get one quartz per round of multiple battles. It's good, but exhausting..."
"My favorite game, would not recommend."
Great story and game. But the rate ups for the SSR and SR servants are really low so its hard to get a servant that you really want.
Thanks to this I got a new anime to enjoy.
it automatically closed when i open the game after installing
219 days for 1 ssr. 10/10 would suffer again
Definitely a good civ game
"If you don't have the money or the 100's of hours it requires to get the saint quart to buy the good servants, you're only getting craft essence. Gatcha system is rigged, the payout is often times trash, and the guarantee of a 4 star CARD and a 3 star SERVANT for 30 siant quartz is trash, they hand out 3 stars for free like candies, and the 4 star cards are almost always craft essence. Absolutely trash. Love the Fate series, but this is a horribly done gatcha system."
Aqesome
Can at least we be able to save the game progress via google play etc?..
Long wait but worth it.
The game has a great story Good characters And solid gameplay But the horrible gatcha and amount of grind make it drag The game feels slow and the lack of an extra speed option and auto mode bring it down And again The gatcha is awful Play granblue
this game is epic. dont play if you cant take the occasional wall of text.
Best gacha game of all time
FAV GAME OF ALL TIME
"The connections in the game is bad, I usually get disconnected and load too long and doesn't work."
I love this game I keep returning.
Nothing works :/
An amazing game if you have the time to play it.
"Bad in my opinion. But what can i do , this game was made to milk from the fan of the franchise. If you just want a gatcha game that you can grind, turn this game off right away :v"
E rank luck :(
I will give this one star due to poor development of the game. I spend too much time on loading the game. It takes 5-10 minutes to load every match.
Does not launch.
the game is good when it works most of the time it crashed
La sal es eterna
All Hail Gacha
"Great game and fun to play. Also easy to newcomers and with the friend support certain battles can be a breeze. Now granted you can pay for extra quartz (in game for summoning rare items), yet the game has ways of earning it and events and ways of getting rare characters at times and deals of guarentee drops for a fee (honestly it's cheap to me). Plus unlike some games this doesn't feel like a pay to win."
Game has been very entertaining and very easy to play. Not impossible to play without money.
"I really enjoyed when I could play, upgraded my phone and I cannot even open the game now, it's been months and I still can't play with my newer phone"
Excalibur
"Well, I love the game. It's more than you're standard fare gacha game as it includes a worthwhile story and some additional perks if you build your teams properly. The actual game is a turn based stratetgy. Low barrier to entry, high skill ceiling (plus a bit of luck). Only real downside is it doesn't work on half of my devices. Works great on my phone but it doesn't work on my Google Slate."
Novice
If you a fan of the franchise the game is Great. If you not a fan of the Franchise this the worst game you will probably play.
Meh. They should've separated essences from servants gacha. Deleted the game after playing for 4 hrs. Rates are so stingy.
Didn't even get to play the game just sat there with a black screen for over 5 mins multiple times
"I have not been able to stop playing this game. My only quams are that the gatcha is kinda unbalanced, but other than that, great game."
Great worthy throughout time
"Since release, I have been playing ever since. For all I've known, I've had my ups and downs with this game. After all, it's fun."
"I'm unable to open the app at all. A white screen shows for about 2 seconds, then it disappears."
Bad UX/UI. Most of the time spending in this game is in loading screen
Responsive customer support. Moderately generous with rewards. Quite grindy. Literally summon simulator.
"pretty fun game with a nice story. Its very easy to pick up but ofc being a gatcha game it can be hard to play the game with the chars you like if you are a free to play or anything below a whale or super lucky.The missing stars is really only because the price of the quartz in comparison to currency in other gatcha games is VERY expensive. Theres a good amount of ssr guarunteed spawns where you can only use paid for currency, but these dont count the ""free"" quartz bundled into the purchase."
Just got into game and won't let me update. Update keeps restarting after reaching one hundred percent. Would suck to uninstall if not fixed but not gonna waste my time.
This is a dangerous game! You can't stop your lust for waifus and it will eat your soul alive! Great game
Goop app
"A good storyline and most of the units you get through the gatcha are useable. Needs an auto battle though, to make grinding easier."
"Story is good, character design is awesome. But when you are at endgame, all that's left is to collect characters with a 1% draw rate. They give you nowhere near enough currency to get even 2 to 3 of those characters a year. So yeah, Fate Grand: Money Sink."
I thought that this was going to be another poor made game on the Play Store. Type Moon proved me wrong. This is an excellent game with fun mechanics. Also some of the best graphics and specs also attacks ever.
Nice and fun.
Good just very challenging to get even one hero you want or even having enough AP to deploy a good team.
The content makes this game. Unfortunately I don't always have time to read all the exposition and I just want to go ahead and play
Great gun for any fans of the series altjough can be expensive if you cjose the not free to play it.
Increase the drop rates plz
Gacha rate is abysmally low
"Best mobile game I ever played. Graphics/Sprites 10/10 Soundtrack 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Length 10/10 I really enjoy the sprites, they are so smooth, and just look so unique to their own. The soundtrack, oh my god it's so wonderful, the game play is great, my only issue is farming can take a while but it's nothing to push me away from this game whatsoever. The length can very mainly depend on the singularity but it keeps growing. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves Fate."
Pay to lose. Save you money and just buy the doujins. Trust me uNever get what you want and in higher difficulty obvious spikes so u can pay more. Wish I never spent so much
Can't stop playing
"Love this game, it's fun and actually makes the players feel like a community, all united by the same tought: the gacha's a b**ch but makes your good rolls feel better."
The game Makes you dedicate too much time. Should make 5star units easier to get late game like not to many but a few as you get out ranked pretty quickly
Game downloaded incorrectly so had to be redownload Thank you
great game if youre willing on putting in the time.
Great game if u enjoy burning money. Its very doable as free to play though.
"Plays like garbage now. Get a 2 minute long white screen when using noble 
phantasms and it just sits there for several minutes when a new servant is 
needed."
"Fun game, terrible odds. Lots of fun! So many different servants to collect with really challenging battles that make you feel accomplished for beating them. All of the characters have a lot of personality and its easy to get attached to your favs! However the story dialogue is very convoluted and long, and most people I know end up skipping it. Also the chances if getting a 5 star are sooo bad. But if that stuff doesn't bother you, you will have a good time collecting attractive anime people."
Love the story and the servants in this game are awesome
Love it. Nothing feels better !than spending hundreds for a single copy of the rate up character

Love this game. Just wish it Samsung DEX compatible.
"A fun game with a good story. The free saints quartz comes at a slow trickle though, and servant drops are abysmally low even with rate up banners."
"Lots of waifus, smooth animations, and the quality of the english translations is superb"
"Hate the rolling chances, fun tho Edit: nevermind, got papa Gil"
"Better hope you have alot of time on your hands, you will be farming all the time."
crashes on vivo y53
Hail Gacha
has waifus.
I was wondering.... is it normal for newly installed FGO having completely no sounds? That's what I'm experiencing right now and because I just transfered my acc to a new device
Story keeps getting interesting... This game is more of a Visual Novel than a mobile game so gacha is not mandatory to progress
Gatcha games are inherently evil. That isn't enough to get me to stop playing or rate this less than 5 stars. Join the dark side. Roll for your waifus. Get upset when you don't get them. Wait for a banner that has them on a rate up. Fail to obtain again but keep on playing anyway.
10/10 Would Grind endlessly
Yep gud game.
Its great fun especially for Fate fans
Learning history through this is great.
The game have a lot of amazing servants and the animation updates or the animation looks amazing every update
Wish the loading time is faster.
I personality love this game so much from the anime and manga and i just fall in love with it more with this app by the animation but not only that i just love this app by its layout itself
"Great story nice gameplay terrible gacha I spent around 1300 Gems since 1st of December 2019, still no 4*..."
RIP my wallet
I have lost my main account when I tried to issue the transfer number of my smurf account. Is there a way to get my main account back?
"I Rate It Five Stars ,So That You Can Crit The Next Regend Quick Card With 50% Chance."
Very interesting
Love this game... and as a Fate fan i am enjoying this game very well.
Whaling.
Pretty neat and neet game.
Best game and waifus
Just a great game
"Without a doubt, this game has the greatest storyline of all the games I've known. I can never get enough of this game since last 2 years, and just when I was going to give up on this game (bc of E-rank luck), my luck suddenly skyrocketed. Before I have only 2 SSRs and in just like 3 months I got 9 SSRs (I'm F2P btw). It's never too late to give up on things you are passionate about. Maybe you'll want to give up but it is at that time that you'll get what you were wishing. Or not."
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
Addictive. And I like the story and currently watching the anime
Why i cant play it on my Samsung s7 ?its always crash? But the jp version is working fine but i cant enjoy it since its written in japanese.
I could've paid off my student loans with the amount of money I've spent on this game.
Gacha rate sucks
My most used app
Gatcha addiction~
Best Mobile Game so far Great story and thankfully there is no competition which force you to pay money to compete with our players
"Gatcha is a salty hell, but it makes the times it shines on you feel great. The story and frequent updates are the best parts of this game, not all the story is great som sections are low points while others are just pure pleasure to do. Gameplay is good but not great, its engaging with an RNG factor that can make each run feel different."
fuku
Love it one of the best anime games ive ever played definetly is a must to try
Saber best girl
Simply one of the best games.
i lov
My old review is outdated so heres an update. First fix the draw. Ok after that. No game has turned around so well In quality that I've seen. This went from a scam to a legit decent and even great at times game
Emiya
Story is long and intensive.
The grind never ends ._.
"Simple game, great story. Terrible Gacha through, but I don't play it for the Gacha so I don't mind."
"if you love the fate/Stay series, or some really good tactics for battles, this game is right up your alley! and there's plenty of husbandos and waifus to choose from, if you wish. Just, be aware that this is a gacha game. I'm currently F2P so far, but the temptation is always there."
"I love the characters, the lore, and seeing their skills in action."
"On a note 10 plus, app wouldn't start up after update"
The amount ive spend could probably get a deposit on a new house
Waited for a good SSR rate up. Get spooked by Arjuna. 11/10 would play again
"You really don't need to pay money at any point and yet it comes with a 50+ hour story, amazing character designs based off of historical people and fiction, and a battle system that always adds new ideas for simple or complex strategies. Also about 6 large events to play outside the story over the course of every year."
Good story. Enjoyable to follow. Completely possible to play f2p
3 years in this hell and I'm not about to stop. A good gacha but other reviews have better depth than I can write. So read those.
Great game it fun but why is it gacha
"Game wont even open anymore, goes straight to composing an email to the company/whatever and when closing the email screen goes straight back to a black screen then compose email again"
"this game is definition of trash.medicore gameplay,story is just dialogue,most trash summon rate not even 1 4 star servant in 10 multi.stay away from it just cash grab game"
"Good game with a well written stories, but don't hope for 5 star characters. They are hard to get, and you have to understand that they have to make money out of it, so they could continue the app running."
I love story and battles and event

Havent been able to log into the game consistently for the past two or three updates. I keep getting stuck at the black connection stream and whenever I do log in every menu or screen in the game loads just as slowly. Please fix it soon as I'd like to not miss my last chance at finishing the Kara no Kyokai event.
"Slow and boring, rates are terrible compared to most gatchas. Waste of time/money"
"Waste of time. BROTHERS AND SISTERS EXIT THE GACHA HELL NOW or you will end up on different levels of Hell. For example, QP Hell and Mat Hell. Stay Away"
Gameplay becomes grindy and repetitive. Gimmicky enemies especially with the multiple health bar type fights become annoying. The worst offender is probably the gacha rates which are borderline theft when compared to other games' rates.
i cant play on my phone Realme 5 pro im always stuck at Black screen at the jp version is smooth and i play it faster
App crash doesn't open
Game crashes immediately. Fresh first-time install on Android 10.
"The gatcha system is SUPER SUPER really bad unless you are going to spent a lot of money... if not, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get any new character to use"
"I've been playing on strong for nearly two years now, and if I know what can make the difference to an outsider to try this game, it would be that it's very plot driven, wonderful story, first time I ever cried because of a game's plot. The characters (servants) in this game are all detailed, and theres no slope. Even 3 stars are useful, so despite the god awful rates of the SSR servants, don't let that discourage you from playing this! You will love the characters and the battle system!"
Great fun and with new content always on the way I love it
Very naisu ceaserino
Excelent game with an intriguing and deep storyline
Scam Gacha
"Great story, solid writing, lovable cast of characters (with great character designs as well), and addictive gameplay. FGO is definitely one of the better mobile games out there and I highly recommend it even to people haven't watched any of the Fate shows (It presents a whole new story for newcomers). The only downside is that the gacha system could be a liiiiittle bit better... It can be very difficult to get high ranking servants that you want. Other than that, great game. Go play it."
ÔΩÑÔΩÑÔΩÑ
Awesome Sauce!!!
One of The Greatest Mobile Games Ever
Very boring and not rewarding enough for the time that it takes to do everything.
Good game but load times are atrocious. Sorry it is bad enough for me not to continue playing.
This game is 50% load screens 50% gameplay. New players will have a rough start as the currency for summoning is very slow to obtain (1 per campaign mission completed) and you need 30! On top of that the rates are low and they don't seem to have any freebies to new players. This game feels like a waste of time.
"Can't get past the tutorial. When I open the app, it crashes before I can do anything. Just port it to pc."
"While this game has some value to those who enjoy the franchise, I find it tiresome and unfulfilling due to its reliance on monetization in order to progress. That, coupled with the inability to reliably obtain the main source of summons through hard work / dedication, leaves me disappointed and unmotivated to continue playing."
Really cool and character and the setting
Dog
Can't load game data it always stop at 6%
"Excellent game!!! Love the story and the gameplay. I wish I had more time in the day to play... the only thing I dont like about the game is it blocks all out of game sound, alot of the time when I play I'm in an area where I have to turn the sound off, it would be nice if I could play my own music in the background!!!"
I love character concepts
Is a good game but my problem is the loading takee to long
"The game and story are enjoyable, the grinidng isn't the worst grind I've ever had. The low rarity servants, welfares and occassional SR tickets definitely help bolster your team options. If you are willing to invest funds once or twice a year there's the GSSR for a guaranteed 5* in case you are simply too unlucky to roll one normally. I genuinely enjoy the plot and the event subplots are also an enjoyable time, but I wouldn't recommend spending too much for this particular gacha outside GSSR."
Everything is GREAT keep up the good work devs and can you please raise the draw rate of servants a little please
I love this game it's my absolute favorite series and game but the reason it's only 2 stars is a story I had a great account both my favorite summons Jeanne arc and her alter form there was an incident were the wrong app got deleted and when I tried to use my transfer code it said already in use so now I have lost all my work and im left with the saddening trudge of trying to grasp and the pointless chance of getting them again ....
Meh.
"I would play this again, if only loadings were faster."
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"FGO's story is steps above what most other Gacha games have. That being said only get into FGO if you are really into the Fate series and into Gacha games. The rate you get Saint Quartz (Premium Currency) to roll for Servants is slow unless there are a lot of events that shell it out. You can save up hundreds of dollars of Quartz on a rate up banner for a 4 or 5 star Servant and come out bust due to the sadistically low rates. Going Free to Play is possible, but it's going to be a ton of work."
Cool.
"Perfect game aside from the excessive rarity system popular with these kinds of games. I know someone who plays on the Japanese servers and they have almost every single 5* (highest rarity) character upgraded in a way that requires 4 additional copies of the same character to achieve, without spending too much. My brother playing on the American servers almost religiously for a year without spending anything and had 1 copy of maybe 10 (of around 50). Playing casually & spending $60, I got 3."
Dosent run on my s7
Please remove the blue border and support more aspect ratios. Phones these days are not 16:9.
I really enjoy this game and the anime. I couldn't ask for a better game.
This game is truly amazing
The ultimate gacha game...only good experince if you whale.XD
"Good story, gameplay is pretty nice. The gacha is kinda broken, but the real issue is the loading time and the slow menu. Other than that, it's good but could be better"
"The customer service is fantastic. I lost my transfer code for my old account and I just emailed them on a whim, not expecting anything to come of it. It had been years since I'd accessed it, after all. Nope. In what was I want to say a day or two, they helped me recover my account with no issues. For that, I've got nothing but the highest of praises. Thank you so much."
üßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇ
Too much Gacha Salt!!
I dropped $150 to get Jalter and I didn't so I'm still salty about that but I'm having fun with the game
I love the gameplay of grand order but the game is opening in a white screen then instantly crashing i do not know why i have uninstalled and reinstalled i have a brand new samsung s10e. Please help if possible or patch please i really enjoy this game and would like to be able to play again
Play it.......Fool
Help me get my account back üò≠
"Predatory ""Energy bar"" practices make it hard for me to give this anything higher than a 1 star. I really like the game but get rid of the AP consumption. Its an outdated way to engineer a game."
"more mini games please. and more husbandos. we need a summer asterios, gil, and ozymandias. overall it's amazing as it should be. the only issue i have is the long loading time"
Lots of depth
"Great characters,and a very detailed storyline, make this a great game to play for fans of Fate, or even if you dont know the franchize. Highly recommended!"
Pretty good game I wish it was more exploratory!
Will not launch on Google pixel 2 Android 10
The Gacha is the only thing that detracts from this game. As in its low odds of success.
"It's a predatory Skinner box, proudly sporting the worst aspects of pay2win mobile gaming on the wave of the ever popular Fate franchise. As a game it's complete garbage though, highly recommend passing on the game and just look up pics of your Fate waifu online instead."
It's good but the game gets boring fast.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! YES!!
#bestgame
"Gacha hell, but overall that it's fun. Save for Jalter or Merlin"
"A lovely addition to the Fate series absolutely ruined by greed that would shock even EA. For a game in a series with so many loved characters to lock many behind both a time gate of up to potentially a year and a half before they return, they are also locked behind a less than 1% drop rate that costs $20 per chance."
"tell you what, rate-up is a lie"
Always Addicted :)
FUN
One of the first mobile games with an actually good story. Gameplay was something I didn't see myself getting into but after some time it won me over.What really keeps me playing is the hero summoning system which allows a servant to be gained for free (or paid). Design and voice acting is also not mediocre at all due to talented actors and artists. Overall excellent game.
Best game fun characters and love the stories
Good game to throw your money away
"Amazing game with worthy rewards, i would love for more things to do tho, example other different ways to get resources like a bonus mission with specified resources."
It was a good game but I never acquired anything good from the saint quartz summoning... It's just way to frustrating after keeping a lot of it and it won't give you just one 4* fighter after a 2 or 3 of 30 saint quartz worth of summoning like what a waist.. Please improve it for once..
the game is good but the loading is too long
Best RPG game ever
Love It
Love this game number one game on android great time waster reccomend highly
"My only real complaint with the game is the summoning, almost every summon i get the only new thing i get is craft essence. These rates are abysmal, usually duplicate 3* when a unit is given."
Been fun
Everythings great :)
"It is a very fun game, it really shows how much the Fate series has come along throughout the years. So many servants to choose from, so many combinations of skills, mystic codes, and noble phantasms. I give this 5 stars. I highly recommend it for anyone who has the time. Plus all the cool events where they give you free servants for completing them. It's my all time favorite game ü§©"
Great game! Really fun! But im mostly sticking with it cause the stories are great!
Super grindy and the gameplay isn't super exciting but if you like fate and want to fill some of your free time its the best gacha game.
"Fun game, just wish getting Saint's Quartz was easier"
"Overall a very fun game. Lots of characters yo collect, and it's nice to make new friends in this game."
Love the game and I recently had an issue with game randomly not working I emailed support and they very promptly let me know they got my email and was looking into it then a few hours later told me the solution to my problem so not only a good game but great support as well!!! Thanks again guys!
"Amazing game game with good in depth story, even in the side events. However leveling is a crazy grind though and you need to update the app almost every week."
"Updates somewhat fixed the stability, but the game is still extremely laggy and is sometimes unresponsive to input within just a few minutes of starting it."
"The game has updated its engine for android 10. Now, it plays much better! It is still a gacha game, so don't expect that it's going to be easy to be a f2p. It's worth playing if you're already interested in the Fate Series, though."
Fun and don't have to pay for anything
Only mobile game I've played for years. But man the gacha has no mercy
"Updates on 11/8/2019 cause game to soft lock after initial title screen. Can't get to the main menu. Resolved by reinstalling the program. ALWAYS HAVE A TRANSFER NUMBER READY! Glad I did, or I'd be DONE. Samsung Galaxy S9+ with the latest phone update."
Good game but summon system is very harsh and money consumed. The reward and maintain apologies reward system is fairly enough.
New server? I missed 2 welfares DW. I missed tWo. .
"Gacha bad, game good"
It is such a great game! The story is better than most post-Camelot and the gacha rates are great! I got 15 five stars without spending any money so far!
big tiddie anime women nice
"Very good, excellent."
"Fun game, drops could be better"
Its just an amazing game. I'm a giant fan of the series and seeing all the characters and collecting them is a lot of fun for me.
Pretty ok.
"Overall, the story is great, and the game play is pretty good. This is one of the only games that I've come back to after more than a year. That said, the gotcha rates are abysmal, and it either takes a lot of grinding or tons of money to get the best heros."
Great story. Not very f2p friendly but game play is very good.
"I lost my account once and contacted the customer service! Well, I contacted the JP but they're very kind to respond and gave me the information to send it to the right email for NA accounts. I was thankful to get my account back and I made sure I won't lose it again. I'm in it for free to play and I still love this gacha hell no matter what!"
Just nice all around for me
"The only issue is loading times. Otherwise it's a well animated, enjoyable game that's beatable completely F2P."
Great strategy game. I just hate the fact that I have invested so much money into getting jpegs of my favorite waifus.
Karna
Fun game. But the gacha system prevents me from scoring it 5 Stars
Very fun game very exciting just kinda tiring cause of how drop rates are kinda small chance but ohwell
Big fan!
It's awesome in so many levels
boi
"So far, I've almost beaten the second singularity and it's getting interesting with the plot. So, I'm looking forward to the other singularities after I complete the Hundred Years of Dragon War."
"Nice game, but mat grins hurts"
"horrible rates. Good gameplay, and everything else"
kiyohime best waifu.
Nc game even I only have 2 ssr for 1year
"After the last update, the game kept freezing. Update, it all worked out, but still 1 star for gatcha rates."
Great game but the gacha is a lie
"Gacha rates are pretty bad if you want a top tier servant. At the same time the difference between 3 and 5 star is a matter of inches usually, it matters for difficulty but doesn't gate any of the content. Favourite servant is a leonidas (2-star) that can loop his np and tank all damage when you level him up all the way, trivialising some late game bosses, so that's something. Lot's of events too so there is rarely a dull moment."
All of my husbandos and waifus in one place!
"The true soul-crushing gacha game, if you're reading this, it's not too late: uninstall this and run before it takes your bank account with completely terrible roll chances. Wish I could give it a 0, because less than 1 percent for a banner character is despicable."
Best app for fgo fans. It's easy at first but it will give a challenge in next stages of the game. And very in depth story so you won't get bored.
Game currently does not work on Android 10.
I LOVE THIS GAME
"Unique mechanics and loveable difficulty spikes (after you get over the shock of dying instantly), and although the gacha is bad civilization, it's RNG is realistic. In other words, you won't get an SSR without dakimakura catalysts or saving for a literal year. (coughcough JAlter on last 3 SQ w/ daki headpats) The story is meh at the start, but it really picks up in the Sixth and Seventh Singularities (if you don't already know what they are, please, play the game up to that point). 8.8/10 :3"
Lots of fun. Great story. Great characters!
Storyline is fun to read and easy to play.
Good f2p friendly game.
Literally one of the best gacha games ever. You can not spend a single penny and still get the servants you want. Or you can be a whale lol. Please add a Kaiser Wilhelm II servant.
This game is absolutely amazing. The gotcha system could be a bit better but it's still doesn't take away from this game. It's the best mobile RPG game you will come across
JALTER AW YEAHHHH
Fun game though I wish I could play in on the PC.
"I'm always a fan of the fate franchise and this game is great! Events are crazily funny... Also, GACHA HELL ü§£"
This game is addictive and it makes my sanity and wallet disappear from thin air.
I love it.. The story from each singularities are very good and the game was very entertaining.
"This game has become a terrible addiction for me, I have spent far more money on this than is reasonable to the point of financial destruction. It's still enjoyable, the game is good, characters are great and I am actively involved."
"The grind is real. Gameplay isn't top notch and kinda becomes repetitive but the Story? No Mobile Game story can compare to FGO! Especially, in its 2nd Arc! It all about to get real brah. Harden your heart fellow masters as all your achievements in the 1st Arc is all but naught. Don't look back its all about survival now. Also rate up is a lie and Kirie enjoys torturing me with my rolls. For new masters. Always take care of your Kouhai! She's going to take care of you!"
"What do I say, the character designs are too good to turn a blind eye to. Updates are consistent and feature filled, with fully fleshed out backstories for new servants and challenges."
Fate series
<3 <3
Good game but I haven't got to roll any SSR for over 7 months so... Could you please give me one? :3
OKITA!!!!!!
I wish i had more waifus
5 stars even tho i dont get any
Addict of waifus
I love Fate series
It was fun. Except for the gacha. Gacha rateup is a lie
Very good game honestly this is game is god tier I hope the company behind the arcade releases their version to ps4 or even ps5. Thank you for such a amazing mobile game.
I just collect the waifus.
Best Game for Weebs
story picks up later dont worry
"Game is 100% f2p if you are willing to put the time and effort in to it, the story is fantastic with nice characters. Only down side is the really bad gatcha rates"
"Gacha rates are garbage, would be 5 stars if they had rates similar to azur lane."
Grear game
"If you could fix this I would love to play to this game, make it an option if you want support from other players or not, I want only my characters when I go fight"
"Very enjoyable, can be free to play if need be but come on we need those Japanese waifus."
It's really fun to play but once you want to summon servants either you cry of pure enjoyment or cry bc your are broke afüòÇ but overall I really love it!
"I enjoy the game for its great story. While I admit that the drop rate for the 5 star servents is...well trash, it does not change the incredible story. Make no mistake, the five star Servents are excellent and certainly make combat easier, but you are more than capable of going through the story just about any servent you summon (with some exceptions) all in all my favorite phone game."
Can you guys please add an auto feature for this game please for grinding purposes.
Crashes on launch on Zenfone 6.
Super fun to play. I love the fate series and fgo but I just wished this game didn't slap you in the face with terrible servant drops. Literally I'm only getting 3 star stuff and than when I do get a 5 star it's literally a craft essence. The game makes you grind almost towards the end of 2 chapters. That being it gives you 1 crystal each mission and at the endof the chapter it gives you 10. Don't get me wrong this game is by far one of the best jrpg out in NA these days. I love it tho.
"Great game, if a bit overly grindy for some of the features. Only ""real"" complaints I have is that they should take a note out of Dokkan's book and up some of the rates for five star units, even though most every other rarity has some form of usability due to upping their max level limit and levelling abilities/skills up. Would recommend if you want just a long-term style game, or are a fan of the Fate/Stay Night series as a whole"
Even tho i dont watch the fate series i just really ran out of ideas to play and found this game!
"Can't even play the game. Read about it that it's unplayed if you updated to the latest android update. Using a pixel 3 with latest firmware. Sad, was interested in trying it. Back to playing arknights, epic seven, and brave frontier."
Where's Android 10 optimization?
Is there a way to retrieve my account after changing my phone? Lost all my progress after changing unit. Failed to ise the data transfer.
The app won't open
Pretty good overall. Massive grinding a pain though. However the main story makes it worth it and just makes you comeback for more.
flawless gameplay and lore. has everything you could ask for in a gacha. beware of tapping fatigue tho. trust me it's real. my fingers are aching from playing too much.
nut
Really fun and addicting :)
An App that let's you enjoy having RPG and have a lot's of waifus and husbandos
OSAKABEHIME GUNNER PLS! ‚òπÔ∏è
"Great game! It gets all the love. Is what I would like to say but, the problems I have with the game are firstly, that after you beat a level it takes you back to the mission select screen. Secondly, You have go through the process of selecting a friend's servant (which isn't optional). And thirdly, going through all the sub stages on a stage only to get 1 Saint Quartz. All this coupled with the fact that the drop rates in the game are abysmal making the game tedious and boring to say the least."
Rng is stupid bad
"Fun game, especially for fans of typemoon and fate series"
"I lost everything after the issues with the Android update. I had been playing for almost 2 years. I tried to uninstall and then re-install and all my data was lost. I would love to keep playing, but I don't want to start from square one and customer suppory hasn't gotten back to me on the possibility of restoring my save. It has been months and nobody from customer service has contacted me about the loss of my account."
i love the story but the combat turns really stale after a bit
Love the art
This game is so much fun no wonder why it's always has the highest grossing
"love all my in game waifus, just wish i had more time to grind and level all of them up (; w ;)"
"How can you have an app that won't allow user connect to your server ??? I search on the web, people had this kind of problems since 2016.... still not fix. Update: got it to work, game is great."
Its a great game. Collect your favorite servant enjoy a story serious or a meme overall 8 out 10.
Not working on my galaxy note 10+
Please fix your game! The new update makes the game lag even more than before!
damn moe waifus
"All I can say is that this is one of the best games I've played so far in android. It has a easy gameplay which anyone could pretty much easily understand. The story is very interesting, henceforth you won't be bored from it. You will find yourself deep onto the history of the characters. The farming of materials takes time but overall it'll be worth. Overall 11/10 game for me! Looking forward for more interesting updates in the future! üòäüíñ"
It's awesome and fun
Very fun game. Too much salt
Loved it. Make it amazing plz
YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS
always in love on fate series
After purchasing a new phone and following proper protocal for switching accounts one day i updated FGO on normal patch day and it deleted my account off my phone. Unfortunately i also had lost my transfer numbers so i couldn't get it back. I loved my account and now can no longer play it. 2 stars now.
Best gotcha game out there!! If you want to suffer that is.
"This game is Good, but having SSR is damn.....huhuhuhuhu. Please give us a chance to pick SSR Servants instead of craft essence"
Gacha is not balance and i don't know why I'm still playing this game
Let's go bad then good. Bad 1)Saber face. How a few characters have exactly same face. 2) Ridiculous gacha rates. Good 1) Awesome husbands or waifus. 2) Story picks up later 3) Login bonuses
My opinion from a week of playing... +No/few errors. +Decent combat. +Fusion mechanics are generous compared to other games. -Few options settings. -Drop rates seem bad. -Premium currency is expensive. -Lots of exclusives.
Great game for those who enjoy the Fate series.
"Terrible microtransaction economy with RNG mechanics that nickel and dime you bloody everywhere. Don't play this game, just enjoy the franchise from afar."
kewl
Rate up is somewhat a lie
Whale. Just whale. Keep whaling.
"I love the game, totally engaging and been playing it for an year. Good plot, interesting mechanisms, the events are fun to play and tons of lovable characters. The negatives being the low gatcha rates tho, I'm not really THAT bothered by it even tho I'm a free player and F2P but, what really annoys me is that we have to select a friend support no matter what. There are times when I wanna test my own servants and go solo and it's annoying when we just have to choose a support no matter what :("
its good
Further proof that my gacha addiction knows no bounds...
Game crashing on redmi note 5 (whyred) after new miui update
The only tricky about this game is data transfer cos there is no bind or log in in this game. üòä I hope the CS will be replying fast too cos I lost my password for my old account 1 year ago..
"Lost my account that i've put so much work into because you have to ""transfer data"" in order to save your account, im not aware of that so i lost all of my progress, but you seriously needs to implement login system to avoid this kind of problem"
FGO can be a good game but from time to time it can be bad wht I mean by this is the drop rates
Love it <3
5 stars easy.
Fun game great characters. Need more ishtar and offline mode for viewing or editing characters or offline free battle to practice or for fun
I enjoy the gatcha very much
So far so good. The gacha is balanced since the time for you to summon is depended on the player decision. Not all the times you are lucky. The game is easy to understand. The story is good.
"Every now and then I try reinstalling FGO. And then I try to launch it, it doesn't work and opens Gmail instead, and I uninstall it and find a different game to play. It has never worked since it was released and I have no idea why."
Do not want to see this game on my playlist. Lost all my progress. Freakin annoying
Extremely fun
Hella addicting 10/10
Great game with great charecters and a story that gets even better.
"Would be 5 stars. But the translators keep changing things to fit their fanfiction, and it's creating plotholes. So that takes a star and a half. Half a star is taken because of the horrible gacha rates."
Rates tho
Waifu roller simulator it's like rolling a lottery
It's a very Fun game
"Yorokobe shounen!!! Your wish shall come true. Unlimited Black KeysWorks!!! You don't like it ??? Here, have a plate of Mapo Tofu then."
"Best gacha game I ever played, you can play through the content with just low rarity servants."
Lots of fun with great content always being added
"Solid game, but as a veteran of other, better gacha games (Granblue fantasy, Azur Lane, Arknights) the battle system leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the characters are great though, the writing is entertaining and it does satisfy the only reason I picked the game up, which is to learn the backstory of the various characters. Def needs an auto-battle function though, as the fighting is a slow, laggy chore."
Umu best
"The game is excellent if you are into anime or/and the fate series the gacha is hell, so don't expect to be getting ssr servants all the time but in the end the game is fun and addictive"
"One day I'll be able to play again! I haven't been able to play since Dec. I've emailed Devs with the crash report and never got any response. Oh well, maybe one day..."
"Only the story is good, the game itself is trash. Don't try this if you're not gonna spend $$$."
"If you're going to give someone a special event ticket. Maybe make sure they can actually use it, instead of not being able to use it and taking up space in their inventory, like useless junk, and pissing off the player more each time they try and use it."
"I really enjoy this game very much! I love the story, music and gameplay! It's awesome! Is there a way you could bring back a memorial event to replay the final bosses in each singularity? I really want to replay the Solomon battle in the London singularity. I loved that battle! The music was epic, too! If you can, it'll be gladly appreciated! ~"
Exceptional
"This is a good game, you can be free to play without an issue. As you can use friend list servants to help/carry you. If you are new and looking to get into it check out fgo discords for help."
"Wont work on my phone Cherry Mobile AM1010V pls fix it. It just go white 
screen then force shutdown. I really want to play this game ty."
new player here..how do i claim the free 4 sr servant??i already got the ticket but i cant seem to find the babylonia campaign part two in da vinci event exchange shop.. i already finished singularity F help plss :((
I better get drops
"Very fun, rich story. Only thing that bothers me is the drop rate."
Story is dreadfully slow.
Im a huge fate fan and this game really hits the sweet spot for my fanboy needs
"Game crashes on launch, even after reinstalling."
How this gacha game got 739.6m USD revenue in Japan alone- I will never know.
I wanted to like this game - but the insane loading times makes it very unenjoyable. I'll look for another gacha game to play~
Ok Noice Good Bro
You give em your money. You get used to it. You will be satisfied. Probably.
"I love this game but god help me now that i lost my phone and just goty new one, its aickening you have to use a transfer number to carry over your game sata inatead of it being backed up on your google account or their servers like anything can happen tk your phone and everythinf tou worked hard for is gone. Have contacted this company via email to ask for my account back now that i habey new phone and have not heard from them it has been over a week."
24Mbps wifi connection but still laggy. Cant play
It's really enjoyable and addictingüëç
"It's a fun and very addictive, but when I open the app I lost 8 months of progress in the game, also have start all over again."
Like this games it is so good to play it
"Yes all the stories about item droprates and gacha rates are true, but the main selling point of this game is the story which unites different Nasuverse mechanics and ideas. The story may feel rough in the early levels, but I promise you that it just gets better."
Game trash
Fun game with an endless flow of interesting events and even more interesting new characters. The gameplay contains a lot of great mechanics that allows for strategic team building and battling that keeps the experience fresh even if you've been playing for a long time.
drop rare up is a lie.
"good but getting gems for the summons takes too long and the gameplay is just so slow. Also for summons you can only do some with free, hard earned ones. While the good summons you have to buy gems to do"
? Nailed it
Not working on my phone!
ÊúÄÈ´ò
I played for 2 and Half year only to Suffer to this hellish Game yeah some of you Newbies got a really lucky when you are begginer After you Got 4* &5* easily and Easily progress into the game the thing is while you are having a good time Me and Other unfortunate suffer for 000.01 chance for 4* and 5* Servants this game is Bait and Really Takes your Time but when you reach the 12th chapter you Realize how Idiot you are for playing this game Really really Ubsurd cause you can't get what you want.
"I really wanna play the game but. It seems I get and error when I downloaded it. When I open it the screen turns and it opens Gmail. After that it says ""Gmail Has Stopped Working"" how can I fix that? I'm on Android version 8.1.0"
"gacha rolls really make me salty, but its a good game"
Pretty good game but maintainence takes ridiculously long times.The longest one i have been through is about 9 hours+
The game is adicting but the rates are very low
PlZZZZZZZ WORK
Fixed my previous problem. Its pretty good.
"I spend 300 saint quarts in every banner still No luck getting 5 star servant. The gacha rate is to low to get a 5 star servant even it has a rate up, I hope you increase the rate for gacha for every banner."
"One of very few good Gacha games. Fantastic story that takes 50+ hours to plough through, and will see you fighting pirates on the high seas and laying siege to the walls of Camelot, amongst other highlights. Ah, and Gacha odds are TERRIBLE....but fair. Take it from me, drop chances don't go up if you buy in."
Too much data in update. Looks boring. Slow.
Loading problems
games that put items and units in the same banner are terrible. drop rates already bad but your guranteed high level could be and most of the time will be an item.
Fix this
Good game. What makes this game so unique is that you have the ability for your game and your game is a bit of a game for a new team and the team cuz you can use them for a new team or an end game with them in a book game on your own to make sure that you have to get a good thing for them and not get a little better wrestler than the giants are in a different relationship than that of my friends in the same way I do but it seems they have been in the first half and they don't know how to make.
I do not play mobile games. I play 1 mobile game.
It is a fun game. Though the summon rates are pretty bad.
Highly recommended.
I just installed it again so i can make a review. Ive been wasting much money in this so i want to say. trash gactha rate! ./.
Even after latest update still doesn't work on my poco f1. Tried uninstalling and installing multiple times. It just crashes after opening the app. Too bad. I'm not even using a rooted or unlocked phone. Just plain old stock rom
Beenweeks sinceable to claim weekly reward since theyre not available and not able to summon or claim event rewards properly
"""It is possible that the game will not work on some devices, even with the recommended version or higher."" This statement is the only reason I don't want to play this game..."
Nothing more than a cash grab for a greedy developer. The JP version treats its community well whereas the NA community is nothing more than an afterthought. We're nothing more than a paycheck and they don't even provide the courtesy of even trying to pretend they care.
"Mediocre game mechanics, average story, and horrendous gacha rates. The fact that this game is based off a popular franchise is the only reason it does well. If you take away that aspect, this is nothing more than a below average game."
"Played this off and on awhile back, wanted to see what all of the hype was about. Loading times are atrocious. At least 20 seconds in between short battles, optimization needs TONS of work. Not to mention the installation was the longest for any mobile game I've tried, and I've tried a lot. On a S10+ every other game I play runs fine."
"Nice story, unique gameplay"
"Not exactly the type of game I really enjoy, but the series as a whole is enjoyable, and this continues the story in some serious and heart-wrenching, and some less serious stories that are still just as enjoyable."
"I love this game but sadly I keep deleting it to make room for other games. But I keep reinstalling it, just kinda wish I didn't always have to start back from the beginning each time."
"Become a whale, join the dolphins, eat the fishes"
Hellish
Love the fate series and the gameplay is enjoyable but everything takes so long to load which is frustrating
"Dear FGO, please stop spook my friend summoning with artoria outta nowhere, all come to me instead thanks ! ü§§üòç‚ô•Ô∏è"
Luv this game
This is simply euphoria. Sorry it is simply my duty as a fate fanboy
I love Fgo my favorite mobile game waifu collector ever!
Sometimes laggy and resolution could be better
"The game is entertaining and well designed. The gatcha aspect is fare and keeps you going. My only compliant with this game is the very, very, very long/numerous loading screens. If they cut out the time/amount of loading screens would be 5/5."
When I try to download the game it just says waiting to download but It's been like that for an hour. Help please Im trying to play.
"Awesome game good graphics, sometimes its kinda salty but still im enjoying the game!"
My phone can't install this app üò°
For real 2 currency??? And the loading times omg...
Fun game bad luck
"One of the few mobile games that I did not uninstall after days of play. Amazing gameplay and good story , low rarity characters along with the few higher ones you get (if you are not spending money) will force you to be resourceful and creative. The only downside I can think of is getting characters you like can be extremely annoying if you are impatient or just straight up unlucky."
Manage tranfer data is terrible
Need help my Fgo app keeps crashing. Really need help.
Goes well with storyline
"I've played F/GO for the past 2 years, and it's been one of my main games for a long time. The story is extremely engaging and I always find myself loving the characters as I learn more about them. The battle system is fairly simple, and as a fan of turn based combat in RPGs I've always gotten at least some enjoyment out of it. On the negative side, the game more or less requires extensive grinding to clear event shops and get materials which some may dislike, as well as the low gacha rates."
"This game is going strong and I love this game since I watched the Anime. Nice graphics, good animation and gameplay. Also it's a gacha game, so you roll for your wanted servants. It's tough 'cause you can't have it all but it's rewarding you finally get what you want"
"Incompatible with a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. When I attempt to open the app, my phone locks up for about 5 seconds, goes black and back to normal, then nothing happens after that. Edit: turn off USB debugging on your device"
Wont even launch the game i have a pixel 2 figured it was a good enough phone guess not. Really disappointed
This is better than honkai impact
Game won't even open. Crashes and tries to email support. Using Moto x4 phone.
This is a GOOD game... but it is a hardcore Gatcha game that can demand a lot of money for little gains if you want the best characters.
I bought the saint quartz for a special summons that guaranteed me a 5 star special summons character and I didn`t get one. Game cheated me out of $30. Never buying Saint Quartz again
God-tier gacha game
All of non 4* & 5* is very usable. Not all 5* are OP
"Irrelevant. Waste of time. This so called game is the greatest joke of all time of all universe. ( e.g. skipping irrelevant cutscene (as they call it:) requires additional confirmation, really ? ))) Not speaking about bull$$%ting about historical heroes as if in game)) Devs could find better job around."
For dem waifus!
game won't run on Huawei p20 with Android 9.1.0. Is it that hard to make it compatible on more devices
"Gameplay is fairly simple to understand. Made it to the third part of the story and was unlucky enough to not draw a single decent unit -- the rates are horrid. Game up until that point would have been exceedingly difficult if not for the broken support system. You rely so heavily on the overpowered supports that you don't even feel like your own characters are contributing. I played for the story, but the art is ok, and the animation is terrible. Just doesn't feel worth it. I quit."
"It's a PvE gacha. Free-to-play users can experience all the content without spending any money. Rates for 5-stars are low (less than 1% with no pity system), but the free content is very viable. All story content is designed with intent to build a specific experience with no deliberately unfair situations. Grind only for what you want. Respects your time if you want to be casual."
Not working on my SAMSUNG A50
Fun game but can you make it to where you can play on multiple devices and it saves that would be great
My favorite mobile game of all time... and by no means I could say it's perfect but still regardless of the game being perfect or not. Just the CHARACTERS and the STORY makes it really worth playing.
"An absolutely magical game. I've had so much fun with it, the story, the characters, the friendly player base (Like the FGO Board on 9gag.), all of it amazing. Now the game does get a little rough with RNG at times and things get tough... But do I regret playing FGO over the last two years? Not at all, I look forward to many more years with Fate Grand Order."
Lit story
I disliked the menus for they where very confusing.
App does not work.
"Great game, great characters, wish the summoning rates were higher, but that's the life of a f2p player, still a great game and the story is incredible."
"Love the game, but... I'm easily salty on not getting the servants that I want. Feelsbadma n"
"You have to worry about deleting it, because there's no way to save your progress."
Overall a Fun Game for ppl New fans to the FATE franchise or Old Fans the Game Has no P2W mechanics and Reward F2P players who are willing to put the effort and time to Grind the Game for their Servants~ <3 although... (Pls make the Droprates higher)
Game doesn't open
Love how the game work :P
"It's not opening. When executed, it goes back to the phone screen then is asking me to login which i f***** don't know what to login when it the login has been populated, it says google can't login on this up. What a bummer."
"Nice game, Interesting story, Nice update. Forget the rate up just keep up"
Cant even start the game keeps giving me connection issues popup when im connected to my wifi and test it with internet surfing and stuff but no issues in surfing the web
this still the best
Not at all a good game
There are a lot of fantastic games out there and I believe is game is one of them.
"I'll be honest and say that the game feels very outdated in comparison to other gacha games. Its not a bad game, the game has one of the more well written stories ( some parts from Nasu ). The characters are very interesting and cute ( Im biased to fate characters however ). Apart from that the game is very harsh. SQ is hard to come by after finishing the story chapters ( more are soon to come in future updates ) and the gacha system is very unforgiving. UI is pretty slow with loads taking ages."
Gacha garbage.
Wish there are more male heroes. Please stop turning all the male historical figures to female.
The game crashes on start-up that honestly sucks i was so hype to play this
a solid game if you don't mind the ssr rate and the endless grind
If I dont get a very rare character I will get my 5 strar ratings üòè
Good civ
This game gave me depression 5/5
Wouldn't let me know why it wouldn't let me load game all the way to start trying out game..
"I've tried starting this game over 4 times now cause I love the Fate series. Story is good gameplay is ok, but gacha is terrible. I decided to try it again since i saw the new years gacha event with guaranteed 5* (which i've never had one before), only to realize after downloading the game again its locked behind paid gacha gems and not the regular gems you attain from pushing content. Only play if you're ok with spending dumb money, or ok with only using 3* characters"
"There needs to be a Guaranteed Sr with the rolls. I have decent luck but some people can spend hundreds without even a single Sr drop. Rates are terrible on summoning, Quartz feels too overpriced. Other then those complaints, I feel like the game has a solid story, fun gameplay, and lovable characters. The biggest downfall about the Ascension system is how hard it can be at times to get the Materials needed, but there are very good solutions as well being to just up the drop chance."
I'd give it 5 stars but I lost all my progress! It's just frustrating I got servants that I'll probably never have again! But it's still a good game that's why I didn't give it 1 star. Keep up the good work anyway
I love doing gacha
i've been trying to get thie game to run on my Razer Phone 2 for several months. Can anyone help?
Great stories awesome events this is the best mobile game I ever played!!
Why do I use every enhance feature to be frozen?
"If not for the gatcha, I'd rate it a full 5 stars. The story is unique and great (I love Dr. Roman's comments), and the battle system is strategic and immersing. Edit: for everyone who's complaining about the gatcha, this is how most gatcha games make money. Looking at it from afar with the level up system in mind, it makes more sense to not hand out servants so easily. I only wish they made it easier to level up craft essences and hand out more (free) Saint Quartz when completing missions."
All hail DW!!!
"I love this game, it has a great story (At least from chapter 6 on), the gamplay is fun and Every character is usable so there are low rarity servants who can compete with 5 stars (Cu, Arash, Hans... ). The gatcha rates are low, but that makes getting the servant you want much more rewarding. 10/10 Would Recommend"
Try for 1st time and aiming 30 quartz for gacha and try to uninstall and gather quartz again... Its looping with very same gacha can you guess what I got here hmm... Well thank you bye2 1 day game
I WANT TO GO BACK ON PLAYING FGO HOW DO I CLAIM MY OLD ACCOUNT :(
Game crashes on start up
There's a lot of waifu and husbando with challengings quests and a compelling story. What's there not to like?
10/10 pure salt hahahahahahha
"Fun, easy to learn gameplay and plenty of characters to use. There's no P2W since even the lowest tiered characters can be useful and there's no PVP. The only bad thing I've experienced with this game is the horrible gacha rates, which are, admittedly, a non-issue. There are so many freebies that it's hard to complain. If gacha is a concern, then wait for the occasional guaranteed 5* summons. Just have fun and don't expect to obtain every waifu that comes out. Less disappointment that way."
10/10 would not recommend
"I love Fate in general, so of course I'm going to play the free game. The story mode is so good! Type Moon, you need to license more Fate stuff internationally apart from just anime series. But yeah, this game let's you summon cute waifus. I've already gotten both Foreigners as a F2P, so I'm loving the game more."
This game is fun and so addicting to the point i don't want to my phone down. It's in the top 3 most best anime games i ever played.
It's clear the Japanese developers are going out of their way to inconvenience the English version and users of the game.
Almost impossible to get characters you want but gameplay is alright
"Immersive story, wonderful graphics and a smorgasbord of characters from the entire fate franchise. The events are always good too, so you'll never be bored. Beware of the gacha though."
Scam! Don't do it. Not worth it.
I've spent hundreds and it's super worth
"Voice acting is amazing. Gameplay is turn based, easy to follow and you can customize your team of servants to your liking. Each servant has a specialty and class that both helps and hinders. leveling is fairly easy. Also dialogie bubbles is premade, you can also revisit to see diff dialogue. The downside is the crazy hard pulls. The Events make it more interesting, so grinding is a must and it's worth to level up your characters completely. Highly recommend this game."
"very exciting, the stories, servants, quest. like learning an alternative to history, with great depictions of legends, myths."
Could never understand the popularity
"Unique battle system, some say its luck reliant but team composition and strategy really factors in here. It is a gacha game, but plenty of lower rank units are good for lategame, this helps because of the rates. 5* is not required but it helps, you can use units from your friends. Excellent story as well even for non-Fate fans. Customer service is good, couldn't open mine one time and they responded with a solution a little later. Nitpick - the animation for some units are not yet updated."
One of the best games i have played!!! The stories and servants (mostly waifus) are memorable
Nice game for fate series fan's
"I played this a while ago and wanted to try again, but when I downloaded the app and try to launch it, it loads my email and wants me to email their support team."
"While it isn't the worst thing ever, the gameplay is simply draining. The only thing keeping me from getting back into this is the lack of an auto system. I mean, I get why it isn't implemented, considering the random nature of the command cards, but at least having something to automate EXP and event grinding would've made this so much more bearable."
Why hokusai won't come twt
"Best game ever. Story is amazing, not hard to gather material, characters are the best aspect Of this game. Gotcha system is.............üò≠"
"This app is rad and all buti have one problem. Why cant I use 10 summon tickets at once? I've saved them up, just like I've saved my quartz. Shouldnt I be able to use them like quartz? going through 10+ tickets individually takes up too much time. Other than that, nice"
Crashing on 1st time and dont opening game
Worthy of a 5 stars........ i just hope my luck will turn from E to EX cause its sucksXD
"Engaging, fast paced gameplay thats easy to pick up but has a ton of subtlety and depth in its apparently simple gameplay. Story is padded but engaging. Events are hilarious. If you can get past the grinding aspect this is honestly a perfect mobile experience."
"The drop rate for 5 star servants is completely ridiculous. The fact that you have to normally defeat 81 enemies to get 1 saint quartz is stupid. I love the fate series. I can understand low rates but I can't be the only one that gets mad when I see a 5 star essence instead of a Servant with ""increased drop rate"" I dont mind farming but it needs to be better and better log in rewards. Dragon Ball Legends and Bleach Brave souls might have similar drop rates but it's easier to get the currency."
DO NOT DO IT. This game is 100% pay to get anything half way decent. Diamonds are overpriced and draw system is horrible.
"I love it so much! Edit(1/2/20): it is a bit difficult to play my save on my Android tablet, though, so I will be transferring my save file back over to my Android phone."
"Still the best game for me. Awesome characters, good storyline and hype bgm/ost"
"The game crashed immediately upon launching. I'm on the Samsung S10+, Android 10, OneUI 2.0. Please fix this..."
App doesnt launch
Garbage game...doesn't load on any device in my house. Zero stars
There is a lot I want to say about this game massive fate fan but I will keep this brief *The gotcha is one of the worst I've ever experienced *It definitely needs better account binding *AP systems like the one fate go has are archaic definitely needs a rework *Leveling characters is very grindy how much you'll find this a problem will vary by your own tastes The only good part of this game is that it's part of the fate series if it didn't have the fate name it would have died long ago
So good but there are time when it needs to restart the game but still good as I am a fan of nasuverseüòçüòç
Every time i try and enter the game im sent to a gmail adress and it hasn't helped for 2 days now
Here's my review of FGO. Pros: . Slightly good story . nice character art . decent voice acting . Low characters are viable Cons: . 1% gacha rolls for SSR . Endless grind for accessionmaterials . Paid Saint cortz too expensive . Updates can be time consuming Kirei sends his regards.
"I just installed the game and on the first start up, it crashed after showing a white screen for a second then sending me to Gmail to type a support report. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same results. I even tried to force stop and restart my device. Same results. Am I the only one experiences this issue?"
"Compared to other games, this game has a LOT of room for improvement. The resources are mediocre, the currency for summoning rare characters are not only scarce, but expensive and the chances of getting rare characters or cards are abysmal. That said, the developers could improve many visual, story (and even grammar) aspects of the game. You need to do a lot farming too. Otherwise, it is ok... if I'm to invest money in this game, at least five me a AAA quality game."
I am forever grateful to Okita-san.
Fate GO is an addictive game. That is hell you are walking into.
I cant even open the game. Shuts down and crashes right away
Just crashes & tries to my email. Uninstalling.
Story is great but the Gacha is butt
Good good
"I know the Gacha is very bad (although I manage to get a five star hero within 6 days but thats probably because of my luck)but If you ignore that, it has a great story and nice animation that looks slick to me it is a great game"
Rates are trash.
FARM HARD PAY HARD AND U GET REWARDED WITH SHT
"Fgo has: 1- Insultingly low rates 2- absurd amounts of farming 3- no auto mode 4- an extremely unrewarding story mode 5- mostly obscenely terrible banners 6- Gssr paid only banners Everything bad a gacha Game could possibly have, Fgo has it and more. -Why do people play it? Simple. Waifus. The love fans have for the characters of the fate franchise is arguably the only thing keeping this disgusting insult to gacha games alive, which is both nauseating and disappointing."
I love this game. I've played it since it came out. Tons of missions characters and events. It's not pay to win either.
This is a awesome game and playing with their character SO COOL!!!
"Massive timesink plagued with puzzle battles in an obtuse turn based system. Only saved from obscurity because of Fate brand. I wanted to enjoy the story, but the gameplay is made so intentionally boring and frustrating."
Very solid game overall. Good story. Good gameplay mechanics. It keeps you occupied for long periods of time while enjoying what the game has to offer. The game is also easily clearable with the free units available in the fp gacha which is good for the f2p players. Only minor issue is how the gacha system works and the low rates but as I said before d main story can easily be cleared with the free units.
Maybe it's impossible but please catch up to the japanese version atleast the gacha one give us that plus one gacha also please give us a resolution settings and animation update I don't mind the delay content just the animation and setting please
Higher rates please
"As much as I hate the low rates for gacha, the writing is good enough to keep playing. Didn't get Abby tho. FeelsSadMan."
It's an amazing game with absolutely beautiful storyline that's got me hook for almost a year now. I'm looking forward for the next chapter of the story and keep up the good work!
I've played this game on and off for a while I've had fun with it I have also got a new phone and lost my transfer password and contacted the support team as long as you know your team's line up and a friend's username you can get your account back easy so for those of you who have lost their accounts due to unforeseen events I hope this helps
Terrible rates putting me off. Repeated grindjng. Games are stingy with summoning currency
"Good art, bad game. The devs have never heard of the word ""balance"" and it shows. Combat ""difficulty"" is a pure numbers game, except the numbers are entirely wrong. You can walk into a battle less than half the recommended level of your party and get steamrolled. It's clear the game is designed for you to drop a few THOUSAND dollars to get a team of 5 star units right away, or block you from progressing. I am not exaggerating btw, drop rate is 1% for a 5 star, and one pull is 5 dollars."
"good game especially if you like the fate series, it has gotten me to read the real stories of the servants in it. One bad thing about it is the drop rates but they are not that bad as with enough free quests and SQ handouts it is possible to get strong SSRs."
Trash pay to win game.
Later
My abby-chan doesnt want me. Why? WHY DW??? GIVE BACK MY QUARTZ!!!
Terrible loading times bog down the whole game
"Love it, that's all I have to say lmao"
It's soooo slow
Unstable never stop buffing
Can't recover my account from last time...
"Lots of cute characters, both original and from other Fate series. The main story is mostly well written and the event stories are fun. The combat system is very well done, it's easy to learn, but offers many layers of complexity for advanced players. There are some performance issues on lower end devices though, particularly with loading times."
The game is very fun and the customer support is really good. I lost my account and they helped me get back in.
"I love the game and I can't wait for more to come out. I just wish the old event quests would be brought back, so new players or veterans of the game can get what they missed or more prizes."
"So much dialogue. I have played this game for over an hour and managed 3 combats. I've been playing online games for a long time and this is one of the longest dialogues ever. Safe your sanity and time. If they would allow u to skip all of it, it would be better. But you can only skip short bits at a time. This is one game that could have, but will get NONE of my money"
"The fact that this game is based off of getting the best hero, the rate for heroes are extremely low and in my opinion it makes the game just not fun and the amount of cards i have versus my heroes is shameful"
"Amazing story, perfect for avid fate fans"
I could not play or open the game because my device is a chromebook. This problem needs to be fixed.
I love it so much
Its not fun when you never get anything decent
Trade your money for a 0.7% chance of getting pictures of your favorite characters. Pay more to try again. My wallet is 0/10. 10/10 would try again.
Fix Android 10 compatibility
Rate up is a lie but I'm very invested and the welfare event servants aren't half bad. Mostly f2p but I have a decent amount of SSR like Raikou
when i try to buy saint quartz it keeps saying that saint quartz purchase is cancelled PLEASE NEED HELP ASAP
Absolute BS the game refused to give me anything just anything
"game is fun, can progress smoothly without much ssr's but having some sure does make life easier. just wish gacha rates were better tho"
That's the hell you're walking into -An anonymous gacha addicted player
Good game but everything loads to slow
It's fun really like the story and gameplay
Crashes. Can't even open it to play. New s10+. Nice game.
"The worst 5* summon rates and pools polluted with garbage essence. However, you don't need 5* to win. All servants are useable, and no PVP means whaling doesn't matter as much. Simple gameplay. Easy events. Good time investment vs payoff."
I'm not an addict I swear
"Love the Game so lucky to get Servants But can you add Google play so that I won't be using transfer ID's, Totally love the game Great game I even downloaded Japanese version of it HAHAHA"
Destroyed my life in the most fun way possible.
Nice support
Amazing characters and unique experience
I love this game.... But gacha is a lie....
I've always been a huge fate fan until this game no mobile app has been able to hold my interest for more than moments at a time
"I like everything except the gacha, gacha is cruel, You may have a lot of Saint Quartz yet still not getting the servant you want. It would be nice if they increased the drop rates for a five star servant..."
Fun gameplay and a story thats gets better the more you play.
Its a fun game with pletty of characters and upgrades to improve your team and it never repeats a event or process its truly one of the best games in the whole store
I am not able to play on my most recently updated Samsung Galaxy S10. Wanted to give this popular game a try but the app won't even open
Dope.
"Very fun and easy to get into. Will take time though. Progression is linear. Recommended to reroll for a character you like. All units are good. Events are fun and story is well written in some parts. But the gacha currency is given out very sparsely. Hard to get specific character without whaling. <1% rate and all that. Mobile gacha so grind hell. Combat uninspired and no auto. ""That's hell you're walking into."" -Some nameless red mama"
"Literally can't start the game, keeps direct me to gmail for support."
"Okay, I'm not giving this game 5 stars just for the hell of it. I'm new to the Fate series, and I originally downloaded the game so I can try my luck in getting Napoleon. Still haven't gotten him, but that isn't really an issue. My issue is that it does take time to load sometimes, but that's already a problem on my end. Grinding can take long, but it's reasonable enough if you grind multiole things. Can't say gacha odds suck either, since I got a 4* and a 5* in a 10 summon once. Story is best."
"Game would not even start, crashed as soon as I opened the app."
dragonslayer
Would like to be able to play the game. However the app immediately crashes after installing when you attempt to open it. Have downloaded multiple times and updated my phone but the game doesn't work.
"The Story and Animations are amazing. As for the gacha, they could improve it a little but it all depends on ur luck"
It's a salty AF Hell... But it can be fun
The game is awesome. Just wish the gacha was not so brutal ;-;
Fate and Gacha. My two strongest addictions in one place! Lol.
Can't play. I already send you an E-mail today please reply
As a day two player who havent skip a day i dont recommend any one play this game.
"Fate grand order is good but I want to ask if you can do a gifting system for acencion materials , exp and servants with friends it would be perfect if you have a 5 star you don't want you can trade with someone for another 5 star that would be awesome"
ok let me start off by saying my main problem with this game everyone on my team is legit just taking up space except my Heracles and my partner character. mash is basical a buff monkey and after the second singularity the difficulty spikes   ok with that out of the way my second problem is the stupid and i mean absolutely stupid gatcha rates i play a lo of these types of games and this game's system is by far the worst if you want something thats actually good to play with in this game or whats called a 4* or higher servant you have a 4% chance of actually pulling one. the rest is basical garbage or waifu fodder  another huge problem is that team members actually are pointless unless they are 4* because you do not receive enough exp boosters thingys even if you grind the daily missions that give you tons this is probably the main design flaw. with members that do nothing you are basically forced not to use 3*s a example of a game who made teams actually have a point is a game like puzzles and dragons where your team is not for some reason separated like in this one now here's my last problem the game is boring the gameplay is nonexistent i could complain more but theirs no space
"i have been playing this game on my previous phone, but it seem not playable on my new device (Pocophone F1),i do hope that dev will working with this as i can't reach you with email. edited, it seem i can play it again, hope get ereshkigal"
"Love the art, love the events, do NOT love gacha rates, the worst game you'll ever play for gacha types ü§£, but you are a fan of fate/stay then you are home. On a serious note, this game is not for the faint of heart, this will have you happy and raging."
Greatest
Maiter lag. Have to start all over!!!! Neal Christmas. Now I can't in to a game serveüò≠
I lost my account after I made a new transfer # and it keeps saying transfer failed. I copied and pasted both my transfer and password. Now its all gone. Thanks NA. Guess ill go back to JP
"Wish I could give half a star, having to brute force my way through certain boss fights with command spells and saint quartz because I don't have the wiki open to find out what obscure ass servant I don't own that they are weak to is definitely high quality gameplay."
"Tried opening game after install, automatically opens Gmail with the support email already typed in."
See that? 5 stars? ITS HARD TO EARN THEM
Poor gacha experience
"Wow this game is fun, it goes way over the top for so many things. Fans of the source material will love it, and even new comers to the fate series will enjoy it. It's just engaging over all things."
ÁßÅ„Çè„Éï„Ç°„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÉûÂ•Ω„Åç„Åß„Åô
"Crashes on startup on Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, cant say for other devices. Also extremely difficult to obtain Saint Quartz."
Story is good. Matchups are simple but I really straight up hate Gilgamesh. Every other Servant is cool though.
Gatcha is my guilty pleasure üòå
"Almost two years of playing this game, I still enjoy it!"
Lot of adjustment.. *TIme Of Loading was take 1mins or more.. *too much time In blackscreen..loading *its very borring game.. cause of Loading loading loading.......
I really love it because i'm watching the whole series of fate that's all and i really like the graphics and maybe the quartz will be less because it is so expensive and it is hard to grind a quartz and hope that this upcoming christmas they should give a lots of quartz as a thanks giving thanks
"oh forsure worst gacha ever, looks great, fun story but like acouple events a year w .0000000000000006% five star rate just feels awful."
"Gacha rate are extremely bad and I think they made the gacha rate even worse over the pass few months. I spent 230 gems and 65 tickets and did not get anything good aside for craft essents game play outdated. Story good probably the best you well ever read. I recommend only for player who are fans of the Fate series, but there better game to play for mobile with guarentee 5 star characters."
Prepare for Gacha Hell!
"The game is overall fun. The graphics are nice and the game is simple. Honestly, the drop rates really are quite annoying but it's not really necessary to get 5‚òÜ servants. The loading isn't as long as some make it to be. Just press the screen to know if it's really loading and, of course, try to get a better connection. The game takes patience. Not only in the loading screen but also with getting stronger and levelling up. This isn't a pay to win game. They want you to grind for your items."
loading screen simulator
"Great game with an amazing storyline, definitely recommend it to anyone"
Why the heck does email fgo support open when I click the app. Instead of the app working it just bugs out and sends me to gmail with FGO suppor. Pls help I really want to play but why is the app not working!
"My biggest gripe with the game was the lengthy unskipable animations that took up at least 70% of the battle time. This made the game unnecessarily tedious to play, especially evident in an event or when grinding for resources. The actual gameplay was not bad but it really did become stale because of the above mentioned issue."
Best waifu collector game
Gacha sucks you need a luck if you want to get sr but story is good
Its is good
"Having an issue trying to download the update as it keeps saying ""It's waiting"" for the download."
It's really fun to play but hard to level up
5*. Worst game I've ever played. Nice work for creating this hell
There's a lot of crash. But so far the game is good. Plus the characters and storyline is best!
Yuh
"Game is decent with a really nice amount of things. Has good art, graphics, animations and a wide variety of characters to choose from. Unlike any other gacha game, there is no ""fodder"" characters. Literally every character is viable from 1* to 5* characters as long as you invest in skills and levels. Each and every character will be useful at some point or another. Just make sure you have a good team comp to make up for strengths and weaknesses. Make sure to do events to."
Increase the rate up please
This game can be slow on the summoning but I really didnt might is still a good modile game for Fate fan this is a guarantee good game so 5 stars from me
"A fun game. Hard to find all of the anime adaptations, takes a little to get used to."
Literally goes to black screen when starting and is completely unplayable
Love this game amazing story and characters
It's just fun
One of the best mobile games I have played.
Love this game!!!
Love it!!! The waifu wars are real!!!
the game itself is awesome and also the developer of this game is very accomodating when i emailed them.
To be honest I just love this (specifically for wasting my time for the few traps in the game).
This game is addicting and has a great story. the characters good or evil are likeable. I am happy about the new content
"Absolutely wonderful. Got me playing for hours. Really fun, mechanics are great. Story is really good too. 100% recommendation."
Thank u for introducing me my first waifu
"ok, first, the gacha system is awfully cruel..so when summoning servants and getting materials, dont get your hopes up, besides in the series, masters dont get to choose their servants unless they have a catalyst for summoning. next is the loading time, its long..still if youre really into the fate series i bet you'll like it i mean, this is like the extended version of it, you get to see many heroic spirits teaming them up the way you want. You dont need to pay to win, just work hard on it."
Gameplay and summon chances are not too good. A game not for the mass.
Thanks for your game
Very salty but I enjoyed it.
"I think it's a great game and I enjoy playing it, I just wish it had some auto play to make grinding easier..."
Favourite game. Gacha rates are not that good I must say but I've been lucky some times so it kind of cancels out the times I've been unlucky. Might not be the same for everybody though
i love this game so let's make it simple. This is game Is Great for fate fans and it's a must play.. if your not one of us you know what to do XD.. Simple right
"i changed my mind now after a year of giving it a one star, since i got Abby on the first tix ‚ù§"
great game good story very f2p although since this is a waifu game the rate sucks
Really?
Addictive!
"RATE UP IS A LIE, I DON'T NEED ANYMORE SALT!"
I've played the game since its release on NA and yeah boi the game is the best. Really glad i played it and will forever play it! Love from Philippines
"For FSN fans but dont take it too seriously, just play it for fun since most of the time they do stuff to milk money from whales and suckers"
I wasted an entire holiday worth of money on umu bride and got nth in return :) Cant say i didn see tat coming 10/10 would do it again
"i think that this is the best game i have played because it is japanese game ( english edition ) and the japanese did the great jobs giving us fun and interesting event , servants ,one hell of a good adventure and strategy , who ever dislike this game maybe you just haven't watch the fate series, and i tell you this :don't hate it because it's 2D or look bad, the Best of this game is the story line and AWESOME EVENT !!!!"
"Overall this game breathes a fresh new air for both new and old Fate series fans, It has a Great Story, Amazing Character Design and Fun Gameplay but the only downside is the grind for saint quartz and the low gacha rates but for me its a great game for fans of the series and rpg gamers alike(Please be more generous with benefits and bonuses like in the Japanese Server)thats all and thanks."
Loading times are too long for me. Not worth it.
"An absolute joke, this is a game where you can spend thousands of dollars and not get a character that's supposedly ""rate up"". A game full of cucks that laugh and meme their own masochistic spending and disappointment with pathetic jokes to justify it. The only reason this game gets by with such dispicable monetization is because of the IP it's based on, hiding the best looking and most desired characters behind a less than 1% chance to get them. The gameplay is aged and repetative."
My previous phone broke a year ago and a friend decided to try and get me back into the game. The recovery process is the worst thing I have ever seen and it seems like they dont actually read your emails. I would never recommend this game to anyone. One of the worst customer service I have ever recieved.
"Burns your wallet, but it doesnt matter if tou are a huge fan of the Fate series. ‚ô°"
"Not a game most would enjoy. Is a very grindy game that can get boring for using the same characters in the first 3 worlds. Whatever you get on you first two x10 pulls, you are technically married to the charcater until you get a 5* which is as difficult as epic sevens but they have a pity system. The currency to summon are given scarcely. And the load times to get in and out of battle are way too long. For a dated game it does not link with google play so if uninstall your account will be gone."
This game is horrible
Change my rating if i get ereshkigal
"Dear aniplex inc,please add indonesian language in this game"
Amazing Game
Is FGO!!!!! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Terrible character drop rates
Fun but gacha is bad
Needs NP animation skip!
Great story with your favorite servants but do not spend money on this game because the way to get 5 star servants is horrible and waste of money.
"If you love Fate, you will love this. Visual novel style story with superb writing. Only downside is Gacha rates are really bad but other than that, ton of fun"
Bad it sucks lol
OK I will be frank the game Is very boring I had the game for 2 years and I barely made it past tutorial the drop rates are the worst when it says double rate up its a lie getting quartz takes for ever I rarely log in I log in like once every 2 months and that's it the log In bonus is bad and useless items and the game should have a auto mode for story mode but the devs said it won't have auto mode another reason to not get the game if you just Want a reading simulator than get this game
"Amazing, best game to kill time and doesn't restrict players that play for free."
This game is an experience that all boomer and zoomers should experience. Gambling is a good habit that i have cultivated over the years and is the only thing keeping me alive.
"Like this games RNG, I won't give it a 5 start but a 4 star"
Everytime i use gilgamesh i get fps drop and the fps is capped at 30 when wil you guys support high frame rate in the game
Need more event for sq
A great game and fun story. The only downside is the expensive average price you have to pay for the good rarity servants as the odds are just too low. I would much rather just pay flat out prices for servants. like seriously hear me. I'm willing to pay expensive flat prices for servants that I want. I won't pay another cent unless I'm getting exactly what I want
My tablet instantly crashes when i open the app
Loved it
It a good time killer
"I think the game is great personally i like the combat, the visuals and the idea of fighting with my favorite characters because i think you can beat the game with anyone given enough effort. However the gatcha system on the other hand is rage inducing with the sheer amount of craft essence that plauges the gatcha with a higher get chance that i feel like is lying to me about the rates, as i keep going through the campaign i do most side events for quartz just to wast my effort getting essence"
"Personally im a huge fan of Fate series so the concept of a game based off it was exciting however after I downloaded it my love of Fate died a little I expected it to be rather original gameplay but i feel like it's just recycled games with an original story ""Sort of"" i would have loved it if they put actual effort into making a masterpiece instead of following trending game layouts my honest opinion this game needs a full RE-BOOT and more originality in the gameplay"
"Game crash on razer phone 2, please fix"
"I rate this 3 stars because of how slow the loading screens in the game are,like it takes like full 20-40 seconds of loading.I don't think it is because of my phone since i tested it out on good phones.Hence why i didn't continue playing this game since it takes too much time.If the loading screens was just shorten enough then maybe i would come back to it."
"Don't play this game if you still care for your wallet, otherwise, the story and gameplay is decent. Enjoy the game"
"Gameplay and story is great problem is the terrible gacha drop rates, i heard some players saved up to more than 500+ and still get nothing, if you don't have any strong will in not getting what you want then i dont recommend you this game"
"This game is well designed in terms of function and the story is unique, but the gacha rates are way too miserable and abysmal for how long and difficult it is to acquire game currency for summoning characters. Nobody should spend hundreds of saint quartz for nothing new or useful at all. The fact an entire singularity can barely scrape up enough for a single 10 summon is ridiculous. I used to really enjoy this game, but the work is not proportionate to the reward if there even is one."
Boring gameplay and terrible gacha rates
This game so bad it should not have been in the play store to being with p.s make a diffrent better verson of this game that doesnot suck ok
"It good, <3 fate forever"
Best gacha game out there.
"if you're playing this as a completionist with the need to collect every character then....prepare a lot...and i mean A LOT of cash unlesh you really lucky son of a gun then it probably gonna be just a lot BUT if you're in it for the story and especially if you're a fate fans then you're in for a great ride (some are boring but some are just simply amazing) Gameplay is simple all you have to do is use buff,attack,then use NP when it can be used so its pretty much dummy proof Character Design superb! i like every single one of them (except one for personal reason purely for the aesthetic aspect of it) and voice actors/actress did a amazing job at it so Conclusion! don't expect to get everything unless you're prepared to blow all of your cash...and just enjoy the ride"
Perfect but is a bit slow
"Low rates like holy cow its almost impossible to get the servants you love, good luck tothis game tho cuz you know youll lose casual players if you dont act fast with the problemof the game and to listen to your players/customers."
I know it's a great game but I can't play it on my Android ( I got a galaxy S7) a everytime i download it can open so as much i want to play this game I can't
Love the singularities and events.
Generally kind of have fun with this game.
"Cannot play it, attempting to open the game causes it to immediately crash"
"It's a really fun game, and it had a lot of great characters in the story that I've gotten attach to."
It's alright I guess. I kill time with it. Stopped caring about the story. Sometimes don't feel like playing it anymore.... Don't feel like touching Epic of Remnant or Lostbelt. I forget why I still play it. I just do....
One of a kind game where real money isn't really needed to beat powerful bosses. The only reason one would spend money is having the desire to collect characters(waifus/husbandos). Great strategy game that would challenge a player's team building. Ex. A 90+Lvl boss can be beaten by just the right team if one would devise a strategy. Further examples can be seen in youtube videos of several creators. Some showcasing the usefulness of less rare servants.
The suffer
"Just be cautious, this game has a terrible gacha system, the only way to have a chance of summoning something you want is via buying the summoning items ( example 20 tickets and 200 qartz, no 5 star) each 10 roll being 30 qartz, the final singularity is also the most challenging so far, besides that a nice game."
I have so much fun playing fgo. it is hard some times but it has a friend system and could use a friend's servant. And it have a great story. i would recommend for all anime fans
Very fun game please continue to make new updates and fix bugs as they are found
"Love this game, the gacha might not be great but I really love the story and combat mechanics it's so unique."
"Gacha is bad, but has great story"
Can't log in have a full white screen ..everyother game works fine
This is my favorite game Not recommended
"I was planning on writing a review to make people want to play this game, but I instead wanted people to see for themselves how it is. There are many problems with the game, yet if you were to ask me what my favorite game is it would always be FGO (or NIER Automata‚ô°). There has never been such an imperfectly perfect game such as this and I am just happy to be a part of such an amazing community of people who are lead by devs who have great creativity and passion for their work. May you get a 5‚òÜ!"
Biddies
Chances of getting a 5 star and four star servents are low and should be a little more higher chance %
"Ehhhh its ok but if you start after a key unit is no longer available, you will be at a disadvantage. Good luck with gacha though, terrifying rates"
Played it for a few weeks and doesnt connect to servers anymore. The game was fun but now it's just a waste of space and it's been a waste of time. Fix the game please.
I completely love this game
I have spend so much hours days and months but now i can't get in the game i don't want to restart
Crashing upon opening
Great graphics just way to slow switching between scenes
literally could not even open the app.
Crashes upon opening without any message indicating why
Doesn't open on galaxy s8. Instantly crashes.
"In short, it's a pretty good game! Though there could be some minor tweaks, such as the RNG not being as bad, and maybe a trading system with other players?"
Love this game. I just wish that you could do a friend battle. Maybe in a future update this could happen. Otherwise great game to play overall. I would recommend this game in so many ways.
Changed my review to 5 from originally 4 because after getting a feel for how the campaign works with the timed events and summoning limited drop rates I feel very satisfied grinding and having fun trying to take on challenges and use strategy to progress. I also had a some what problem with my account being bugged but the tech support is really good and helpful.
Worthy of the name fate/
The game is good. Gacha rates are quite low but I dont mind it. Its just the loading times are too long. I hope you can make it faster.
The only problem is the gacha. 10/10 great game and great franchise.
"Nice storyline and awesome animation graphics, keep up the good work and release more servants"
"It's good but the loading times were a serious issue and for someone with as limited patience as me, I just couldn't enjoy the game as much. I regret uninstalling it but until the devs streamline the game a bit more for much faster loading times (not to mention the installation time), I wont be re-installing it. Goodbye for now, favorite waifu Nero. You will be missed."
"A top tier in the story department. The writing keeps me motivated to grind for the next upgrades and progress. The good sound and art helps enhance that experience. The gameplay is fluid and nice, but the grind without quality of life will require determination. Grindy repetition that demands attention makes it hard to multitask. It's a drag that bores to manualy play it."
Donate D20
"Downloaded this game due to a friends recommendation and was dissapointed when it didnt open, and instead opened an email app and pasted a message saying ""Fate/Grand Order is not playable under your playing environment. Please contact us via email then we will give you an information about the data migration to the sender's email address."""
"Awesome hell gacha and there Customer Service is very Awesome too, the event is always new not other games, same event in 15 days or 30 days of course F2P too."
Good game but the only problem is the loading it always took so long if they fix it maybe i will come back and play this game again
Got tentacle loli first summon
Thes games help me think helps feed my head by helping on thinking finding what was there befor it came gone from its place injoy your night
"Works with Android 10, so I'm back to happily wasting time."
The story is good but the gacha rate is really low I hope the gacha rate is like in jp
Cant even open it
What I like about this game is that it simple and does not have PVP. Will play it till it dies.
"Just a little slow on the load time if you don't have a expensive phone but the graphics are well worth it and it's a fantastic game, by far one of the best ones out there for Android or iPhone"
gacha rate ia horible
Love it absolutely love it
"If you already love the Fate series, or even if you just want a place to get started. You play for the meta humor and the waifus."
Server Connection Problems. Plus the game is unresponsive sometimes due to poor loading.
fun
"The story and gameplay is quite decent for a mobile game. Gameplay is a combination of a visual novel and a turn based RPG. You do not need the rarer 4/5 star servants to complete the main scenario quests, but it will make for a much easier time on certain encounters with them. The F2P servants (1 - 3 star) are sufficient to complete the main scenario, but may prove to be challenging. Expect servant progression to be grind heavy."
"Great game, but the the required connection makes it impossible to play on the go, plus lately it's been unable to connect more than I've been able to play it"
Gacha... nuff said
"Xmas rerun 2019 happened And JP showed that NA could have fixed the problem if they wanted to, but dw dont care so I wont care for this game anymore"
Its not playable and it will just route you to email the devs. Waste of time!
Long live the king gilgamesh (caster) :)))))
Plz add vietnamness language
I AM SPEECHLESS
Very good game if you like history but besides that the characters are also cute and likeable
good game gacha
If you like the fate series you'll like this game
Cannot open the game. Unplayable using my note 10 plus
Not playable VB on my device.Nokia 5.1 plus user.
Opening gane play off putting
I got mama raikou a yokai and a smart shopkeep in only around 2 or 3 months
I can't connect to the game since the latest update. Please help me retrieve my account. I spent a lot of money on this game.
After the recent update I can no longer connect to the game sever
would have gotten 5 stars if you would give me 5 star servants
"DW This isn't funny anymore. I had to download BlueStacks JUST to play your game. And look where it brought me. Back to the 'Failed to connect to the game server' screen. Once again, FIX THIS DAMN BUG AND LET ME PLAY THE GAME!"
If you like the NasuVerse and can live the way of the gacha. Then you will enjoy this game.
i can't start app???
I lov Salt
Game has error code that needs to be fixed right now!
"I hope this january, you will gives us any SR or SSR servants as a reward. The game was good but we need more sq and give chance beginners like me to have a ssr"
Decent game
Unable to open the app at all zzz
"I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the summoning of this game. I have spent 200 dollars and all i got from the summoning are craft essences and 3 stars heroes. While i did receive a few 4 star heroes in an extremely rare occasion, they are all male and not the waifus i that am looking for."
Great game but very addicting.
"Can't even start the game, it crashes. Im on a Pixel 2 Android 10. Please Fix."
I still won't forget the day the long maintence happened but i'll stick around.
"Story seems good, but graphics are poor so I don't understand why loading times take forever."
"THIS WOULD NOT LOAD! It was really annoying, I tried everything and it wouldn't load because of 'bad connection' my wifi was working just fine! It's not worth downloading, and if you got it to work good for you but I had to give this 1 star"
"The story mode and design just amazing. The gacha are quite unfair but that is just much we love the game. The bad part of this game is transfer data... what if you accidently broke the phone? You can't save your game. If only they just save data on google account,twitter and facebook or something when you log it on other phone or PC."
"The gameplay itself is very fun, the graphics and everything pertaining to the story are great. The big problem I have with this game is the gacha rates for high star level servants. I have to fork over $100 if there's a servant I want because there's no other real way to earn saint quartz. Even if I do fork over the money the odds that I'll get someone good are slim to none. The character summon and the craft essence need to be separate summons. To many essences for the servant I do have."
Error 60 on my redmi note 4 running lineage os 16 unrooted. Fgo jp doesnt even post this error :(
This is and will always be my favorite game!
Nice very fun
"I am absolutely addicted to this game and love it, mainly for my already existing love for the Fate franchise before this game. But in all seriousness criticism about the game, it is very fun to play and go through the now 10+ campaigns that are in the game at this point (although first few are a bit dry, they really turn up the heat afterwards). Very f2p friendly too, as any rarity type unit can become extremely useful through even the most difficult quests and missions.So definitely recommend!"
"To all of the negative reviews due to salt: just don't spend money on the game, plain and simple. I get salty as well when I can't get the units I want, but it happens to everyone. It only feels worse when you spend money towards it. If you so spend money, don't blame the company. I feel like the rates are fair more times than not. It is honestly a great game, that can get grindy, but is fun to pick up every now and again."
"As someone who was never into Fate, this game surprised me with a great story, fun mechanics, nice characters and more. The gacha system is a bit pricey but you can do just fine with rolls you are given at the start."
Watch RWBY Volume 4.
"Great game, love the characters and gameplay, good story."
"For some ppl who see the gacha of FGO to be a worst thing, then youre wrong. I am a F2P (free to play) user in this game, and currently i owned 8 SSR servants, knowing that i only started playing around 4 months ago. One of my servants (Merlin) is already NP3. There is no bad luck in this game, just a strategy on how or when you will pull your rolls."
its like i dont want to watch fate grand order babylonia lmao just kidding but im still worried about my old acc cause i cant recover it... so im begging you fgo usa help me recover it.. and i rate 4 star
"Cheap animations, while to load. Only upside is seeing cool servants. Meh."
"it was fun, until I reached Camelot. I just can't beat the Gawain with what I have. I've already spent $151.86 in Saint Quartz to amass my servants. Each Saint Quartz is $0.99, and it'll cost me about 10 Saint Quartz to beat the guy. Type-Moon if you're listening. you use Operant Behavior well. I'm happy to spend on servants, but not on progression. This looks like how it's going to be for the rest of the game. I feel it's going to cost me roughly $300.00 just to beat the game. I'm good, thnx"
Free to play plus historical events? Helps me learn while giving me entertainment... Edit: I cant even get a single 5 star after working hard...i
Can't rate it cause it won't load been on a white screen for 15 mins I gave up
"The downloads suck, plus the game crashed"
This game makes me emotional.
"I couldn't even start the game, I just deleted it. There was an error"
"Loading screens . too much taking time ,"
The gacha rates are abysmal but the gameplay itself is simple and fun. Do not be discouraged if you don't get the Servant you want.
The game is very entertaining. But the system they employ for gaining new characters and craft essences (character equipment) is an abysmal let down. By no means are you even likely to get anything new let alone the character you want. I've played the game for years and put a reasonable amount of money into the game as well. So whilst the gameplay and content they do give you is very nice and certainly entertaining. I wouldn't expect to play with many or any of the characters you like.
"As a Huge ""Fate"" Fan. I'm glad I downloaded this app!"
Fix the bug rooted phone my phone isn't root but i can't play the game
It's a very addicting game and I love it alot this game got me into the fate series
"""Failed to connect to the game server,"" I was planning to go back to this evil gacha game but for some reason, I can't even connect to the game EVEN THOUGH I have full bars 4G LTE connection. This is very sad, why isn't there also at least a single player mode when clearly this game is at times unnecessary to have this soo called ""connection"" when you only need it if you want to either borrow your friends servants or just to flex on your friends. But I find this useless when I want to play alone"
Just black screen. Can't play the game after tutorial.
"I really wanna play your game but it says its unplayable under my playing environment, which im not quite sure what thats suppose to mean"
This game is excellent! Total grindfest but most of all enjoyable.
"I enjoyed this game, but the account system is one of the worst I have ever seen. I've gone through game three times, why because when I uninstalled it because of memory space issues and switching phones, I lost ALL of my progress THREE TIMES. The transfer number hasn't worked a single time when I've tried to use it. I've captured the screenshot of the number, write down my password, and regardless I am never able to log in again. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I am not going through the first chapters of this game again. It's just not worth it."
"A fun, addicting game"
I can live with the RnJesus gachapon and the grind for level and materials. What I can't take is that the game will tell you to get a newer phone and a home Wi-Fi rather than cellular data. I can't count how many times I literally fall asleep and drop my phone due to multiple long loading screens. I just dropped my phone as I fell asleep waiting for the loading time just a few minutes ago.
I like waifu bait.
Ti takes to long when you are going in to a battle
"sugoiiiii. Fate, strategy, waifus/husbando,"
"This game has way more potential than it seems . From worst to least bothering :1. Why is there no pvp when the combat is suitable for it ? 2.The game is also not optimised , it takes so much time for every transition .3. The gacha system is so bland . It need more spins like saber only spins or craft essence only spins . 4.A 20% increase in the overall recources we gain would be cool. 5.It takes long before I get the daily quest for the class I need ."
Hey I'm a fgo player in figuring order told me to uninstall it cuz my game downloading slow it said we keep all my data I download it again and my data is gone how do I go about getting it back what code do I have to put in please somebody answer
I have played this decent game on my iphone and would probably give it a 4/5 there However on my chromebook the app won't even launch just a white screen until i force close it. I can't in good conscience give this any other rating. I hope this is fixed in time but until then if i could give it a 0/5 i would.
History come to life
please be aware that this game can burn your wallet fast great game otherwise ha
It is great for the fans of the fate series
Very gud
Perfect 5
"I'm gonna be honest with ya.. I love the concept of this game, I love the fate series, and I think this would be a great game.. But the odds of you actually getting a servant that you actually want are so low and half the time getting a specific servant is for a limited time that I cannot play this game without hating it.. I would be more interested if it was a little easier to get a servant that you actually wanted instead of someone I could care less about"
Disables your account if you use USB debugging.
"An alright game but in game RNG is such bullcrud, waste of time and no chance to get what you want. RNG does nothing to make the game better and makes it completely a waste of time in the long run."
Love the game play!!!
Its a hell game and if a user rate this game with a low rating that user is just salty to his/her rolls
A 1 player game with a good story line. There are lots of waifus to collect. The challenge quests are fun and the grinding never ends. Saint quartz are limited and gacha rates are some of the lowest with nothing guaranteed and no pity system.
"I enjoy the game greatly but, support with this game is awful. I recently emailed about how an update would cause me to miss a login bonus and I received a response that just about said ""tough luck""."
"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Installed game on my Pixel 2, and it doesn't even start. It closes itself out without ever loading. I started looking online and apparently the game is incompatible with Android 10 and the devs recommend NOT updating your os to play. This is beyond stupid. I could perhaps understand a few days delay but Android 10 has been out for months now. The fact that the devs recommend not updating to a more secure os version in order for people to play is ridiculous."
"The story has it's low points, some singularities are easily worse than others. But even playing the game both casually, and pretty hardcore, I've found myself enjoying it a lot. The gameplay is simple enough that a literal toddler (a friend of mine's child) could play while their parents made food. Yet the optimization of combat mechanics and skill usage leave a surprisingly high skill cap. Plus, it's fate. So I really like that part too."
Lost all my data and yeah am sad i grnded for a long time and since its only able to recover with transfer id i cant get my data back so it would be nive if you could make a diffrent way of recovering your data
"The game is broken, everytime the tutorial is about to finish the screen will turn white and it will say that it cannot connect to the server. And if you click retry the screen will be stuck forever. It's a waste of time to download because of this white screen dead."
"An okay game till Camalot, then it's literally a body drag to the finish. Hurts more when events restrict progression based on how far story you be on."
"Good game, good story; but no H-scene with your servants."
Cool game :)
really good game just lag alot they gotta fix that but honestly it's fun especially with all the different events
So very beautiful
"Awesome! great visuals, i love it!"
Please add a toggle feature for Noble Phantasm subtitles!
"Learned about it at Anime NYC 2019, so far so good. Enjoying it, it does the Anime justice."
Game won't start at all
Really enjoy the game just suck the I can't unlock the event character do to I have to beat the final singularity if that wasn't the case I would give 5 stars
Fun game that's free. It can be a little slow at times
More recently the devs have made it easier to be a ftp player :)
if you're a fan of the fate series then you'll like this game
The anime brought me here and so far i am not dissapointed
"Was working fine the other day and now just sits on a black screen? I want to play, but the game certainly isn't letting me."
Overall a really great game when it comes to all the characters and story I love everything about it but I'm pretty sure you already know when it comes to the gacha part that's where everyone has somethings to say and I'll say this give us more of a chance to actually get rare stuff like 4 or 5 stars a little easier the gacha rates are too low
I just wish that some good characters could actually have different attacks and I also don't get why the booster card(whatever they are called) counts as the cost 4 ur party.
Cured my cancer
I love Fate. I hate being locked out of a game I've spent hundreds on because it hasn't been able to support Android 10 for over a month. Edited because the game works again <3
Cant install the game for some reason even though i have a lot of space in my device with a fast internet connection.
Seiba!
"I like this game. I played since launch until today. It's got an interesting plot, interesting characters, and very funny moments. However, it's clear the game is made to prey on people's gambling habits. Other games have ""pity"" systems in case of bad luck. This doesn't, because why would it? People spend money as it's an IP that they recognize, and whenever you have bad luck, it's ""just how it is."" But things won't change because you follow JP. As such, I have to quit, but you don't care."
Awaome
the story is good exept 2nd 3rd chapters were not that good gameplay is simple and easy to understand getting servents is a bit too hard but other than that it's fun
I would recommend to anyone looking for a F2P freindly game for mobile. Would be 5* if the rates were a smidge better
"Fun game that's more engaging than most mobile titles. There is a minor strategy element and there is no auto battle option which is a plus. Some people will tell you that they enjoy using common rarity servants, but this game first and foremost is a gacha. Your goal and main enjoyment is to collect and max the servants you think are nice (collecting typically 4 and 5 star). The rates on 4 and 5 star rarity are abysmally low, and the cost in USD of the quartz currency to roll the gacha is high."
Make it more like an offline game
Great game good way to pass time ..... so angry want better chances in pulls saber all the way
It's not Raid: Shadow Leg Ends
story is good but need some good rate up gacha
"The game's really good and entertaining! The plot ties in with the lore which I find to be very amusing. Plus, you can play as a boy or girl and switch at anytime you like! However my only complaints are the fact that we can't see what servants we are fighting(until after we beat them..) because that always leaves me unprepared. And where is the male fanservice??? You can't just show off all the ladies in swimsuits and forget about the males!!!!!"
Even if I am a free to play player I still like the game for it's story and gameplay
"very cool, but gacha rate sucks as expected"
"Good game,but need loadscreen spd up"
I'm happy but my wallet isn't.
Awesome game!!! I love the characters and the story line!!! :)
Horrible load time. I literally had 2 days with this game to have it update and have double the load time now. It crash alot as well. Big disappointment
Love the story and characters.
Its a fun to play game.
"Addicting. Confusing at first, but worth the time investment if you like turn based RPGs with tons of depth"
Great game and story just don't get to salty with the rates
ayee
"Great game, great lore. The gacha is hell but its worth it to summon your favorite servants."
"Time to load greatly affects the game experience. I that could be improved by a background download process, it'd be perfect."
"I have enjoyed the game for a little over a season and a half now (started during summer FGO event rerun), and have been playing on and off ever since. Besides a particularly difficult encounter where my party was obliterated in Camelot as a reality check (since I had servants in my party that were unfortunately 20 levels lower than needed), I have enjoyed enhancing my servants and eventually pushing past the story with anything from tactics to brute force if need be. Many thanks!"
"The best gacha you can ever play. Story,art and characters are all nice. I know many players are complaining about its gatcha rate but believe me, its the fairest gacha you can see. P2p or p2w is almost nothing since its all down to each player's luck."
"New to the Fate Series, I'm addicted to the story."
great game!!!
Challenging and fun.
"Honestly a great game overall, besides the rates and grind it's a amazing gacha game."
Yeeet
Its LIT GAME But i want NP UPDATE I WANT IT Also More sq pls. Gotta get My Jalter to Np 5
An unforgiving gacha game that is luckily not PVP yet.
"actually very fun,good story,events are one of the best parts. summon rates are some of the worst ive ever seen in a gacha game though."
Please make it automatically login when maintenance if the maintenance more than 1 day ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Gacha is evil and we're all victims to it. ROLL FOR WAIFUS OR NO LAIFUS!
"It's actually a really good game. The last few story arcs in the original plotline get especially hard, but it's really fun and the story is fantastic. The downside is this is an overly expensive gacha game. Don't fall for the gambling scheme. It's not like you're getting anything real."
"The gameplay is pretty simple, The controls are easy to learn and The graphics (especially the 3d background in battles) are pretty neat, but the game kinda gets boring and repetitive when you're farming nodes for quartz, especially when you have to do the same node 3 times for 1 saint quart which is an absolute snoozefest, and the loading screens can take way too long especially after battles."
Great story and fun combat animations. Lovely art for most of the servants.
"if auto exist, deny JP ver and make a revolution"
Fate/ Grand Order is good civilization
Game is better now üëç
This is good civ
Load times are abysmal.
Can u pls give us guaranteed SSR as if we are doing gacha 100/higher
I bet like 5% of the players have even seen the series xD
Don't expect anything from the game and just wait will come one day
Doesn't work on Android 10
"Amazing game, anyone who says otherwise probably has had bad experiences with summoning. Only bad thing I can think of was the 24 Hour maintenance that happened not long ago but not much was actually lost and the compensation was amazing."
THIS GAME IS ANNOYING ITS NOT LETING ME PLAY
Good game I have always wanted to play fate but there should be an auto mode or tikets to auto clear since its really story based.
After I have install the game I was not able to open the app. It give me an error instead. Please help me with this issued.
"It was fun playing until the update came and told me to redownload my game and I lost all my save data, all the money, time wasted just because they did not have a binding account system, pls do something about it and if possible help me retrieve my account."
Love the anime so much that the game gets 5 stars automatically
"Started to play I was hit with many issues for connectivity to the game. The server could hold me for about 40 seconds max, then it would lose connection, or it would break the game and reset all of my data. It took me 17 hours to only get halfway through the tutorial. I want to play and enjoy the game but this really saddens me and I had to uninstall because of it crashing."
great game but ye
I respect how the developers issue apologies if something goes wrong. It's a great game too.
So enjoy able
"Good story, good graphics, easy to get game mechanics, item drop rate far worst than their gacha drop rate, don't expect np skip but the recent issue over their 24hr maintenance shows subpar management and lack of foresight when their maintenance got extended for more than 12hr. No amount of quarts, apples or ticket, etc can replace the log ins that were reset. They have no contingency or fail safe in such issues and it might/will happen again in the near future so log in count is useless."
"Decent enough game, but the support team is worthless. My login streak was broken during an event due to extended maintenance, and the update news said there was compensation for those in my situation. Except there wasn't any in my mailbox. I contacted support about it twice, and their response was essentially, sucks to be you, but we told you what you would get and we aren't doing anything more. Except the thing is, the whole reason I contacted you is because I DIDN'T GET what you said I would."
Crashes on launch on android 10
Over all it's a great game the only thing I dislike about the game is how many quarts they give u for completing one quest I believe they should raise it to at least 2 or 3 quarts because with getting just one I would have to comple 30 quest just to get the ten rolls and that's a lot of time considering that there's not even 30 main quests in the singularities
They not fix my login streak. I really upset
Didnt like the idleness.
Love it!!!!
Gacha has taken the majority of my life
"This is the P.T. Barnum of mobile games, it will rip you off big time, and yet it gives you the maximum enjoyment. THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME!!! Also, ARTORIA LANCER IS BEST GIRL!"
Fun but pay to play essentially
This game is good civilization
"Gameplay gets stale after a year of playing as it is the same card game-ish over and over again, not much live interaction midgame. The visuals are great though, the characters are well modelled, smooth linings, good graphics. Controls are really easy just tap and tap and tap. Another thing I dont like is how stingy the rolls are for the amount of grind you need to do for the roll. My average good character per roll ratio would maybe be, 1:20 good char to rolls."
Help me plss.... i can't update what is wrong my phone or your game?
Decided to give this another try but now I can't get past the title screen all I get is a white screen and that's it restarted my phone and cleared the cache still can't get past the loading screen
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏™‡πå ‡∏î‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏î ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏´‡∏• ‡πÅ‡∏ï‡πà‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏ó‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏á‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢
My friend lost his account. But thank to the support team he manage to get it back. He been grateful for the fast help the support team provided. But beside that it a really fun game even if the gatcha make you wanna pull your hair out. It all good just gotta wait for free summoning tickets and stuff like that.
"Never even got to start playing. Nothing but errors and failures to load. It isn't my phone either, as I tried 2 other new downloads afterwards without issue."
That's hell you're walking in to.
Login broke due to horrible update
It's playable but prepare to be disappointed at times with less than satisfactory rolls.
"The gatcha system is so unfair!!! Edit: There's a bug on the Santa Event Shop. Everytime, I clicked on the event shop, the screen just freeze. Hope you can fix it."
"Out of all gachas I played, seems fair this game is beast in terms of story expansion, characters and customer service. Yeah it's expensive, but there are other games out there that it's expensive yet customer service is the worst and story is weak and futile. So good job and change the rating into 4.5 *"
"Fun, but can be tedious and frustrating at times. Especially the gacha."
I had a over 700 day login streak but cause of the latest update and the problem with it I wasn't able to login an now I'm having to start all over. But beside that one of the best mobile games there is.
app refused to open.
Where is our 10 tickets? We didn't get them because of the maintenances
Very Addicting and Great if you are a Fate fan
Good enough game cant get the hero I really want type wise could at least let a fan pick type like archer or saber or lancer for first summon
"It's kinda fun, but good luck keeping a login streak. The reset isn't at midnight which threw me off when I missed one day after 47 days in a row. Then this most recent update took about 24 hours along with getting error messages of the servers being overwhelmed and to try again later. So now my next streak of 13 or so was broken again. I'm getting tired of my rewards from logging in getting reset because of this type of easily fixable problems."
The gacha god blessed me with Hercules's and on the banner they gave me gils and merlin
"Gacha rates are bad, and you really don't get anything concrete for doing a 10x roll. But in exchange, you get a game where you can use every single hero in any way you want. There is no competetive aspect in the strictest sense. It will take awhile to get a character you want, but if you're willing to wait for some time, then this game is for you."
Screen get stuck a lot and it doesn't load
"Best game in my opinion. The only one that compares was Holy War: Saber, which I assume died out because I can't find it anywhere"
It is simply the best game that ever exist.
That's hell your walking into. But still pretty awesome.
Really? Bring out a one-day-update then make us lose login streak? No 5star for u this time
Really good story
I help with getting my data back and stuff I have worked hard for ASAP
The game is fun but the load times are incredibly bad.
It's pretty fun
Abandon all hope ye who enter here
uwu
Bone daddy
"HI EXCUSA ME, WHERE THE FLYING FISH IS MY 10 TICKETS FOR SUMMONING AND NOT TO FLIPPING MENTION... MY FRACKING FREAKIDDY FRICK FRACK LOGIN STREAK!!!??????????????? DEVS FIX EITHER YOUR SERVER OR YOURSELF."
Rate up and gacha are a lie
Very grindy game but fun overall
Hot Anime waifu collector is a fun game and made me and my anime waifus happy.
I love Medusa (Lancer)
"Gameplay kinda grindy,boring and unrewarding, doing the same quests over and over for progress with insanely slow quartz for summons,also the most horrid rates for not even 5 stars but 4 stars i have personally have seen on a game.Unless your lucky you can dump a 2 week paycheck in for quarts and still come out with 100% dirt haha. Finally got sick of it and uninstalled without saving my account,didnt see any changes at all and it got sickening spending money to have more fun only to get stress."
this game ruined my life
"Great Story and fun events, it runs really well and there's plenty of content to play through but the rates are terrible for the amount of currency we get."
stupid and incompetent admins/developers...worst game handler......always long maintenance.......
Lmao RIP streaks. Day 1 squad
Favorite game
Your prayers won't save you from the gatcha.
did maint for 24 hours now it wont load
"The story is meant to be reminiscent of the video novel type of storytelling. Some of the events get extremely hoakie, but all around a very enjoyable game worth supporting. No real necessity to spend money on currency because ample awards of currency are available for simply playing. That said, it is worth doing so on the rare occasion to reward excellent content. Enjoy!"
Ill give you 5 star if you give me a 5 star servant üòòüòò
Actual gameplay is just plain boring while the update for new events travels at a snail's pace. I imagine the only reason people still play this game is merely due to the popularity of the Fate franchise itself.
UNLIMITED MAINTENANCE WORKS!!
"Failed to connect to the game. It says my wifi is unstable, but its stable. It'll break my login streak!!!"
Very fun to play!
Couldn't log in 24 hour maintenance.
I love this game but the recent Maintenance really messed up my app and now it can't launch please fix.
Maintenance for over 24 hours broke everyone's log in streaks and did not compensate at all. Delightworks is garbage. Dont support this trash.
i think the summoning rate is bad but the game is overall fun however the grind for items is a pain and should up the drop rate
One of the best mobile games I've ever seen!
"Waifu Wars, Astolfo is best girl"
Can't connect to the server
Its really fun to play
Great game nice story interesting characters love the fate series
Needs some game play improvement
"Very great game. Just a heads up though theres a lot of granding in the game. Also, make sure you set up a password and transfer number in case you have to recover your account."
"I'm officially addicted to gacha now, good grief."
It I wonderful game.
It's just all around fun to play. Normally I hate playing games where you have to read the diolog but this one wants me to read it more I wish the account setup was different but 9 out of 10.
I like this game it's not the best game and I dont think everyone will like it but it's one of my favorite mobile games and urge people to at least try it
The gacha is abit rough but I still love this game/series. Wish they would increase the 5* rates by .10% though at least. Their welfare servants however are worth it though if you have a hard time getting 5*'s like most of us.
To Muchs to load
How long is the maintenance? Its been 2 days now but the maintenance isn't over yet
What's going on with the Maintenance? It says maintenance from 11-11 20:00 hour to TBD. When is the TBD going to be determined?
Cuz waifus
There is an event running right now right? And it has a time limit to finish!!! Why the friggin maintenance!!! No consideration for people who cant play whole day and has to go to work?
The rates are bad but the story is good.
"If you really like Fate, you should probably like this imo"
No money required a great ftp rpg with plenty of content.
Yo it is bommmmmmm!.
"The game itself is actually pretty enjoyable, but if you have developer options or USB debugging enabled on your phone then the game refuses to open. The only way to run the game afterwards seems to be performing a factory reset, but considering I'd only been playing a few days I won't bother."
"Terrible support, lose your account if your phone dies, and some of the most egregious microtransactions in any gacha game I've played. If I could rate it zero, I would. No waifu is worth this."
"Great storyline. It is amazing how much detail and work that they put into making each character! Not only that, they put nearly equal effort into each character, whether it is a 1-star or a 5-star. However, I think they need to raise the 5 star drop rate from 1% to 3%."
At the moment of the recent update it ask to download additional info about 23MB and it cant download the data without crashing. My wifi is doing fine and i have space for the game. It ask to reconnect and my wifi isnt the problem.
Good game but the mantance time too long for us player
Engaging storylines and a vast array of characters. There is gacha for the higher end characters but you can easily do everything without spending a dime.
"So much fun, I can't put my phone down!"
Give me free quarts
"Awesome story line, diverse servants and most of all, in-depth lore!"
Awesome game I've spent more money here than in real life.
Pls gib me those rinfaces
Dammit i cant login due to maintenance amd my login spree will be ruin dammit why
"Fantastic, beautifully illustrated, and lots of player benefits. Great job on the title, one of my favs!!"
Well i have had a this game for a long time and u got to say i love it there are some things thay could be improved but it's fun
Got Nero Bride
Still a fun game to come back to
Fun to play even for a newcomer to the nasuverse. The only problem I have is rarity certain level cap breaks items for the season themed characters.
"After paying lots of money, I stopped playing for a while. Unable to log on, and ignored by support, I'm rating lowly to avoid this app from being suggested to me. Good Bye, thanks for taking my money, with no returns to speak of."
Best waifu simulator
I think the money that I spend on this game could have bought me a mobile home.
"Gatcha games are salt mines, and this is no different. That being said, the story is good at times and the art and animations are all good at bare minimum. There are some things that people won't like but there are plenty more things as well so don't judge it for just the bad things and try to judge it as a whole."
Another Fate VN but you also get to collect your beloved servants. What could possibly be bad about that?
Get this if you like Fate.
This is hell you're walking into - if you gave addiction problems and love for .pngs of your waifus and husbands steer clear because youl'll drop hundreds for them
"Love it, being a gacha game, it has its.. Rng but its so fun"
Thank you for making such a wonderful story!
Thus game is really fun to play and beginner friendly (for the most part). Despite what everyone said this game has some if not the most balanced gameplay for a gacha game. Even lower rarity character can be useful if you know how to build the right team. But on god the drop rates are terrible. üòÅ
I can't even launch the app
"Doesn't work for pixel 3 xl, crashed just by starting it up with nothing running in the background"
Amazing rate it 20 stars
"Really enjoyable game, the lack of pvp make it better because there is not p2w, the rates are a joke for ssr and Sr, but you can clear the content with low rarity units. Beware, this is hell you are walking into it"
Straight up the worst gacha rate and pity system I've seen. God I love this game tho please send help
"Crashes a lot of times, goes ""connection lost"" even when I have stable Internet connection. The game will not respond after pressing ""Retry"" on ""connection lost"" most of the times. Frustrating experience"
Rate up is a lie! The game is very versatile on free units however. As usual though lucky draws 4-5 * stars make the game easier. My first round wasnt the luckiest but second time is the charm!
Wow that's awesome üëçüòÄüëçüòÄüëçüòÄüòÄ
Story is very compelling and is unique.
Made saltier than the see but still a good game
This game is cool üòé
Keeps crashing anytime I try starting it.
"Promises were broken, setting an unfortunate precedent. Otherwise, it's meh."
"Took an extended break to focus on life, returned to an update which seems to have cleared my data, maybe because I downloaded the game on a different platform and updated here?.. RIP Okita and Mordred regardless. Overall okay game but goddamn am I devastated that I can't get Okita now."
"Sell your soul to the gacha, get waifus. 5/5"
I love the Fate series. But this game needs some serious optimization! Any kind of loading takes a long time and takes the momentum of both the game and story down a lot.
"Deceptive and terrible NA management have destroyed any credibility that English translated Type Moon products have left. Claim that bugs are features, lie to community about intents and practices, and completely shutters out any and all feedback. Game is fun but NA handling has ruined it. Play JP instead or just read story translations online."
"Took a month to update for Android 10 (zero compensation for missed events) so I figured I'd wait another month to update my review. I will say it is a ridiculously fun and addictive game, but the gacha rate as well as the expensive of it is horrid. The game is not worth paying a dime on unless it is the garunteed gacha. I will leave it at 3 stars, and will only give more if the gacha gets better and/or the devs actually begin to care about their playerbase."
It sucked
Love it thank you
"It made me love the Fate series even more. Interesting and good story with quirky, funny and badass moments. Gameplay is good and pretty unique. The gacha rates are impossible with no real type of pity system, but you can use the freebies and others you get to do everything, unlike other games where the SSR's end up being necessary."
"It's an amazing game, but with the recent update, it just pauses on the loading screen right before the main menu. It's really pissing me off and don't wanna uninstall the game to lose all the progress I've already put into it"
It's cool. Rates are kinda stupid low though.
"I must have farmed almost 1,000 saints quartz playing this game and I have rolled nothing but 3 star servents and crafts essence. It got to the point where I didn't feel like playing anymore. One day the mobile game demanded a human sacrifice for a 5 star. I thought it was stupid but so many craft essence. So I tried it... My first born son is what it wanted. The mobile game accepted the offer and when I rolled, I saw it, a rainbow stream of light. It was a 5 star... 5 star craft essence..."
This exactly a FREE-TO-PLAY game...but you have to PAY to have fun. ^_^
Amazing game üôåüôå Love the series
"After an update, can no longer open the app."
"I'm hooked on this game. It's simple to grasp at first and has more to it once you learn the mechanics of the game. The rate up banners have bad drop rates for higher rarity servants, but that's gatcha for ya."
Grate game
Best game ever!!!
"Simply, the best. If you're looking for a way to kill some time and read some good VN. Fate never disappoints. You're in for a ride for everytime they give apologems and free quartz. Really not stingy for gifts and rewards. Been playing for almost a year and still hooked up ever since."
"I love my waifus, Frick the gameplay"
Anyone who contributes to the cancer that is nu-TypeMoon deserves death by exposure. They're so retarded that they probably wouldn't even be able to tell they were dying in the first place.
Best moble game ever very addicting cant stop playing
Does not start.
Very entertaining storyline ... charming character design... easy grind but still makes a challenging game specially on events and boss fights ... recommended for anime and jrpg lovers
"Amazing story and characters but is ruined by low drop rates on everything. They use horrid micro transactions that turn you into an addict for trying to get your favorite characters""just a little more money so I can try and get this character"". It would be fine if a 187 pack of saints quartz was like 25 bucks but its 80, which is way to much for a 1% chance to get a character that's a 5 star not even to get the one you want. It's kinda sad that this is a great game but it just about money."
"Great game overall, amazing graphics and story never fails to keep me interested. There are many events continuously being introduced which keeps the content fresh and interesting. The characters are lovable and unique in their own ways, great game! üëç"
"It's okay, I guess. Kinds grindy though, wish I could turn off or skip the noble phantasm animations. Also really needs an auto battle option, would make farming a lot easier."
"I've played this for a little over 500 days now. 1st off, I love the Fate franchise. If it didn't have Fate on it I wouldn't have tried it at all. The game is simple in comparison to other gachas however, there is love behind most of the designs, animations, story, and events. Can be very grindy/Off putting to beginners but very pleasing to max out those .PNG waifus/husbandos. It suffers from a very low-rate gacha and poorly written beginning (1st 4 singularities) but gets amazing onwards."
It's where all your favorite gacha memes come from.
This game is amazing Good work creaters keep it up
How do I recover my old account on this game? I give it 2 star for repeat back from scratch.
Honestly it didnt seem that good at first. But then i realized how fun it was in battle and interaction! I love how there's even a bond for masters and servants
"Simply amazing, one of the greatest mobile games out there if you like rpgs."
Good quality kinda boring sometime but if u get in the middle part its start to get goof keep it up
This game always crash after a fight or after summoning a servant... 2 star for now
"Can't open the app, it says error unplayable environment."
"gameplay is boring, too much loading screen and the loading time takes too long."
"After two whitewashings, I'm officially done with this app and I want nothing to do with it"
The main thing i didnt like about this is the update time it takes about a day for mine to update and when i start playing it wasnt worth it and it was a waste of time
"I use samsung s9 plus and i can't open this game anyway, can you fix it?"
"A very good and addictive game. The only problem is the gacha drop rate. Other than that, definitely a very good game and a good story"
"Bad rates for 5 star, but game is still fun."
Broken for over two months with no end in sight. Doesn't even launch anymore.
Day 7 player here with ~5000 in the game and hit 850 logins. Sadly I got an overdrive version of the crash that's been happening recently stopping me from logging in for 5 days straight. Devs told me to go wait for the next big patch or get a new phone. So I'm moving on to azur lane. Best of luck to you fgo.
Very Great!
"Unable to open the game after install, I am positive my device supports the game. Any help?"
"Keeps force closing on Pixel 3XL Android 10. Already cleared cache, uninstall, reinstalled the app, force close it just won't open."
Battles take too long to load (~1 min) depending on your device.
Ok Good job
Amazing üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
Its honestly a wonderful and addicting game. It keeps pulling me back over and over again with new events and gacha banners.
"I rate five stars, you give me five stars Please"
Currently not playable on Android 9 on Razer phone
Its a perfect game for a private person
Best game to ever live EVER
Washija!
Love it and best part is the game has the characters from the Netflix series of fate.
"The story and interactions are the main reason I play this game. The combat system aspect is fine but can get stale at times, the grind is pretty tedious, and it took me 4 months to get my first 5 star servant, but I do recommend the game. Definitely promotes paying players, but being f2p is very much possible as long as you put in the work."
"Amazing. Great story, only moderately monetized (for a mobile game), all characters can be viable, and of course waifus. Been playing this game since it came out and still love it."
Entertaining and addictive
"Very great, the part that confuses me is how to get rewards from the quest I do"
10/10 gomenasorry not so gomenasorry
"I love this game, even though it treats users like garbage with terrible gacha rates and a heartless lack of summoning resources. If you're a fan of the Fate franchise you can find some of your favorite characters here, but don't expect to get most of them without spending. And in some cases, spending a lot."
"after update , game does nott want to start anymore . i cant uninstall since i might lose my data . it was worling fine before the update"
"I've been enjoyed the game and the anime i watching all the fate/series i've been good to know all the history,myth,and other heroes On the game.its good to play"
"Change to 5 ‚òÜ, got a good loli"
perfect game
Coolest game ever made
It just has a tendency to crash every now and then but it has everything a fate fans could want
Played since week one
Gacha terooos
It's a scam. Doesn't give you the servant you want
"I love the story and the art, and the graphics are good."
Make it to where you can link your Google play account or Facebook account to recover data. Edit: i see that the recovery hasnt changed.
This game is the best. Ancient heroes fighting to save all of Humanity.
Sugoi
Love it! Best waifu collector
Salty gacha but i'm happy bec i got my waifu
"Only problem is too many waifus, not enough time."
"Fate Grand Order is a fun take on characters from certain historical periods, and how they clash together to make a heartwarming story. Though the game is known for its salt in the gacha, the gameplay is easy to understand, and choosing your waifu, Husbando, or Meme is fun to play with even of there are terrible servants. Also if you loose an account expect the support to be the worse at help."
Free Saint Quartz Please
Gatcha is hell
Its an amazing game but goddamn the gotcha and the 5 star servants are to hard to get if not this could have been 5 star rate
It's a very good game.
All the alters are my waifu!!!!!! Change my mind
One of my favorite mobile game
Warzone with historical figures also some are waifu genderbend. 5/5 would throw money to fuel my anime waifu collection addition
I love the fate series in general. The gatcha is a bit of a problem tho. Just save for one or two servants and you will be fine. It also feels as if the servant picks you instead of the other way around.
I want a waifu üò§
"Saved for month's, didn't get Illya. Overall 10/10 experience."
"Fun, good story, good gameplay, just save all your quartz since rates are abysmal."
If i rate it 5 stars i will get more 5 stars
It is super fun and simple to play plus it really does do a good job of working from the show.
Very niceu but wish pull rates were better like instead of 1% pull rate change I to 2%.
"definitely a fun and engaging game. great story, lovely waifus/husbandos. spend your SQ wisely"
I have played this game for over half a year ive finished all the major story missons and got 2 SSR's and 8 SR's and im free to play if you like the fate franchise and have time to kill i recommend it.
Programe alway broken i lost money to this game more than 500$
Download it now
The draw rates are horrendous and mixed with non-hero pulls. But the game itself is quite fun. You don't need 5* characters to beat it which is a good thing.
Best game ever !!!!
"I can't connect to the server, help"
"Good game, good story line, good graphics, but terrible programer who doesn't seem to bother to optimize the apps. Click one button, loading for half minute, click to start battle, loading for 1 minute, battle finish, loading another half minute, and so on. Really bad user experience. And no, it's not my phone or connection problems."
"Fun to play but not being able to disable the support ruins it for me, having to take a hugh level support into a low level quest takes the fun out of it."
The best keep it up
The game loading takes longer that it makes me fall asleep if you can fix it I'll rate this to 5
Good game. Good graphics. No play-to-win.
Great game. I enjoy all the characters and the customer support team is awesome. When a problem happens they get it fixed.
It is really fun and not boring
"Very pay to win unless you're incredibly lucky, like I've been. The story is a great balance of everything. It will have your waifu, or you'll find one. That's really just how it is."
"Game itself is fine. Gacha experiences differ. However, inane design where USB Debug must be disabled for the game to run, or suffer incessant attempts of bug report. Requires me force closing the app from Memories each time I turn back on USB Debug. Unlikely to see the game accept Android advanced features in fear of cheating probably, since game doesn't sync up and is tied to the DEVICE."
"Fun enjoyable game, would love if certain things were easier to get but that's part of the game"
Thank you thank you thank you
Kinda good
Who knew you could spend over 100$ and get absolutely nothing of value or any good characters. Fantastic.
Nic
"Great game play with great story line, i love this"
know your fate
"Awesome game, love the anime, really fun getting favorite characters from the show"
My money is gone ü¶Äü¶Ä
"It's good, I just hate the prices for SQ"
"Absolutely time killing, and very fun, the grinds are just addictive, the story is amazing, events are fun!, Amazing arts and noble phantasms!"
Amazing game! Each Chapter has very interesting and entertaining stories with unique and memorable characters. Historical heroes of all times all clash against one another! Events bring awesome or sometimes funny stories to the table. Its HIGHLY likely youve seen a mayority of these female characters in the websites where you...battle your demon tower. Music is amazing ~ Free to Play is possible easily. Farming to stay afloat is true doe.
Why don't you make my account link with google play? That'd help if if anyone lost their transfer password(like me) to get their account back easily. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GIVE OUT MORE FREE SQS OR IMPROVE YOUR GATCHA RATES
Every summon ticket is a 5*
Amazing game!
Cuts connection off alot but good gameplay. Why does the recent update cause an error. Wont let me play. Please fix it.. Because of the update I was forced to start over my game.... Really makes me mad!üò°
"Don't bother playing this game. The gacha is a scam, drop rates are scam, management are scum and players are in another level of scum."
"Details, Details and more Details... Love It !!! Heck, I got Medusa in my first try... thou then I realised she had a cute and hot form so... Should've downloaded this game years ago xD"
Great üòÜ
THIS GAME SUCKS JUSTLIKE MANY RPGS I'VE PLAYED! . THIS REALLY SUCKS BIG TIME! NOTHING LIKE THE REAL ( F ATE} I HAVE FOR MY COMPUTER IS WAY BETTER.!
It's such a great game!!
nice story... laggy on s9+
Fun story
Great Game still needs earlier updates
Great moblie game!
i want to get off mr kao's wild ride
Prepare for empty wallet
"Great game for fate fans, few issues here and there, but a great story and all the characters we know and love."
It's a great game for any fans of the fate series!
Downloaded in Japan. Best game I have ever played!!!
"Fun game, good story and the events are humorous."
"Great game, my biggest gripe is the rate at which you get the ingame currency severely drops off. It had been a few weeks since my last 10 summon."
"The game is good all and all but there's this constant crashing that messes up the game, especially in events. Grinding itself is already tedious and these ""something went wrong."" everytime I press retry or cancel the game freezes I hope you can fix this."
Has any had issues playing the game and it closes and says it's not under your play environment
"One moment, I was playing a game, when I turned on USB debugging for the app i was developing, now it won't turn on even if you switched back off debugging and developer option. Really sucks on their part not supporting those kind of features."
I rerolled 284 times for miyamoto
Gacha-hell...
.... it was working....
Love the game when it works. After the latest update the game continuously crashes on my device.
"Currently, the game is kicking me out since the release of the new halloween event. Please fix this problem. This happened on my LG G7 ThinQ. Others may be experiencing similar problems."
"Really fun game, but when I tried to transfer my account to my new phone they wouldn't accept my password and when I tried to get a hold of support I never heard anything back. I can't say this game is fun enough to start over from scratch every time you get a new phone or need to transfer your account. I lots a lot of servants I worked hard to obtain so I am fairly upset by this"
Recent update keeps crashing. I can only log in then the app force closes
1 tick Tamamo caster 10/10 would yolo again
Enjoyable but can be expensive
"Unforgiving Gacha, but excellent non-even stories."
I enjoy all the different characters they have in the game as well as the system for combat. I also enjoy the story very much
Gacha is pre-determined just keep rolling singles once every day then you'll get a 5 or 4 star... if you want a specific servant then... good luck!
"Okay so I just figured out that this game can not let me repeat myself can not run with USB Debugging on, if it's on the app just won't open. Glad I figured it out, can't wait to have Mashu Kyrielight in my team! Really wish there was a Facebook or Google Play Games option to sign in to save data. The game was acting wack, so had to delete it and I had my transfer code never used once. I tried signing in with the transfer code and nothing happened, told me it doesn't work. So I have restart now."
"I love this game but it just doesn't seem to work anymore. I'm on a pixel 3axl. Load time for game is 5+ minutes on Wi-Fi, and that's if it decides to connect to the servers. Lots of sputtering, lots of disappointment. I hate to give this game up because I love fate but since the Android 10 update its been unplayable, even after the patch. Very disappointed."
"Enjoyed the game and story up to the end of the toutorial. Once it was completed, started exploring things and the game crashes randomly. Uninstalled because game will not stay open more than a minute or two without any error or indication why."
"The game crashes recently after the update, telling me my game isn't playable in my playing environment and to email them. Please fix this soon."
Latest update causes constant crashes. This game is literally 2 years old and has been play tested by JP. These bugs shoudn't be happening.
after update game keeps crashing
So cool actually I think that everyone should get it.this game is like the best RPG ever
Very entertaining. Wonderfull storyline
Honestly a pretty good game. Through the grind to upgrade servants can get annoying.
"Gacha games are fun, people complain about rolls and not getting 5 stars but thats how a gacha game is, some 3 stars are a lot more powerful than 5 or 4 stars just grind those out as a tip btw! Overall great game!"
"Translation is passable at best. Worst than most fan translations. Runs worse than JP version that has 2 yrs more content, even b4 that vers. Engine update Giveaway SQ doesnt matchup with JP, which i don't personally mind but can be a deal breaker No indication of reducing the 2 yr gap with jp. Be warned"
Phenomal
"It's a good gameplay experience. However on the pixel 3 it crashes now quite frequently, something I've not seen ever on the Japanese version of the game. It's basically not worth even playing on the device right now."
"The micro-transactions are pricey, but even F2P, the game is a great RPG experience, and I feel good about supporting the developers financially given how much I've played the game. Just make sure your ratio of playtime to money spent isn't too lopsided towards the latter, and you'll have a good time!"
Personally my favorite gacha. Know that this is a gacha but the gameplay and story are great. Plus if you stay long enough you can begin to see and understand the depth of strategy available.
"The game was censored without so much as a warning nor an apology, despite promises to the contrary. Over eight months later and despite numerous complaints, there has still yet to be so much as a statement about it. Furthermore, multiple in-game events that were present in the Japanese version were skipped entirely for no reason. The developers are deaf to concerns and criticism. Do not play this game if you value honesty, transparency, or integrity in a developer, as you won't find them here."
Animu wamens are da best
"Great game,you can get alot of characters without paying,or just putting in the effort. Keep up the good work!"
First fate game I've played fun lore and characters cu'cullans a bro
Fate is just great in general
The story is good and gameplay is fine. The performance is bad & there's weird loading at times. But worth it if you're a Fate fan.
"It's a solid game, dont expect to get new characters constantly but they give you solid characters most events that help fill out your teams. Not the game to play if you just like spinning the gatcha wheel but definitely something to pass time."
Best gacha hell ;)
"Unironically my favorite mobile game of all time. The game feels like a proper RPG while still being convenient to play from my pocket! The gacha rates are draconian but honestly, the game is balanced just fine to be entirely clearable with nothing but the freebies anyway, so even if you don't hit the jackpot with the big SSR prizes, you will still win!"
I'm addicted. Please send help. :p
This isn't a game its a money sink. Combat is bland and rng and doesn't understand basic principles nes RPGs did better. Ie random encounters resouces drain. Fgo's are filler and waste your time. You get one interesting fight for 200 + no auto. Devs refuse to fix anything. Like special skip or craft essences in pools to make summoning feel bad. The gatcha is just awful and ruins what might be a mediocre game to garbage. If you like fate watch a playthrough for the story and music avoid this.
Gacha for this game just isn't worth it and it sucks since I love the series so much but I've used probably a good thousand of the in game currency and have been playing for almost a year with only 2 five star characters to show for it. I understand having gacha be stacked against you but if you literally aren't getting anything what's the point in playing?
Love the game great game keep up the good job
"Gacha gacha. The game itself works great. Gacha. The story is well written and interesting for the most part, but due to the nature of the game there is a lot of fluff and battles boating it to about 10x their optional length. Gacha. The actual gameplay loop is fun enough but having to sit through unskippable videos for Noble Phantasms (super moves) is pretty mind numbing. Gacha All that said, this game is inherently gacha-y. A lot of side quests and even the main stories are basic manipulation."
Good game and all but it's pretty rare to get a really good character
Hell of a fun game but the file got too big for my phone so I have to stop playing sadly.
Fantastic mobile rpg.
Heavy-handed changing of dialogue in translation makes this game less than it could've been. Adding memes and ruining characters is horrible. Game performance on Android is the worst I've ever seen. Game is constantly 2 years behind and nothing is ever a surprise with no hope of ever closing the gap to something more reasonable. I really want to love this game but in the end it's trash hard carried by fate.
Great game with so much content
Worst game I've ever played
"don't you go spending those 3 saint quartz all at once lil johnny! F:GO is a great game. But the gacha will eat you if you let it. As long as you're not too discouraged by not being able to roll for big 5* star servants, the 'wellfare' servants should treat you well."
Good game for good wallet
VERY AWESOME
"A fun gotcha-mon style game with all the great hallmarks of the anime, and a quirky self aware humor"
Game stopped working and I can't open it anymore. Problems started when my phone (Android) updated. Edit: game now works again but it took forever and limited time events were missed
"Great game, but makes more sense to playy if you're into the Nasuverse"
This game is amazing I love it and love fate
Gilgamesh!
Love the storylines
"It's a lot of fun, but wow are the cut scenes LOOONG! If they could shorten those that would be great"
its a nice game but its data backup system is a bit dated it doesn't back up to a server or to google or anywhere sadlythe only way to recover is through a code you must get before something happens to your device if you don't you may have a chance at getting your account back by contacting the support and you may not edit still no better way of backing up accounts and to be fair they have had plenty of time
pretty fun game to pass the time
Pretty fun game. Spending money is not required and you can still clear everything in the game. Grind is a bit much tho and the energy system kinda sucks.
Love it just want more 5 Stars lol
"English translation really help since when I played the Japan server i don't get the story. Also, I keep playing this game because they always give me most servant that I want."
"Pretty much a must play for all fans of the Fate series, it's completely possible to play at a steady rate without cashing at all, although the game tends to beat you repeatedly with all the fan favourite characters they dangle in all the banners."
the company does not care about it comunity
Very fun and very addicting
"Highly addictive game but hours of fun! My gacha luck has really improved and I enjoy all the events. You really do need to spend money in order to get those rare 5 star servants as I've come to realize having gotten 5 already just by buying quartz. I just wish you could speed up the battles alot more as grinding becomes tedious and the fastest in game speed is not fast enough. Other than that, the gameplay is simple enough and the graphics are great! I would recommend."
"Been playing for past 2yrs, but still the Gacha rate in this game is soo hard. Not reccomend for f2p players"
Rate Up Is A Lie
"Top notch story, best charater-design, the soundtrack is okay and the game mechanic is decently simple, however, can be challenging if needs to be. One special thing about the game is that even the low-rarity characters are useful and competent. No PvP = relaxing. There are plenty of ways to farm premium currency to compensate for disheartening pull-rate. Being a gacha-based game veteran, I can easily give this one a 5-star."
very great and I love history
Its a great app with beautiful graphucs
Great little RPG. F2P is quite viable and the story is top tier in the mobile market.
"It's awesome, but its events are grind fests. Edit: This is my first gacha game."
"Good, can you make my account luck into ex rank? Cause its hard to not get what I want and wasting my quarts. Please. Lol"
"You'd better enjoy farming, because that's what the ""F"" in FGO stands for."
"Great game with many possible team strats, however the gacha may drive you mad due to low chance of getting SSR/ 5 star servants, but luckily you can still get by with the proper team composition with just 3 stars."
A game that really test your limits and luck at the same time
Really fun game. Lives up to the reputation of the fate series as a whole. And the first phone game Ive ever been faithful too for this long!
Purple mama
"Money is temporary. Love from ur jpeg waifu is eternal. Waifu is laifu, who cares for some papers and numbers in credit cards ?"
Well although the gacha rolls are kinda bad I'm happy with it i deleted it after I got my account login and when I 're downloaded and tried the password and login ID they gave it didn't work but im more than happy I atleast got my saber miyamoto musashi from the gacha so I'm pleased here have a free five stars from me
Wish the rate ups were a bit better
The best game ever !
Waifu Gacha that you can play completely free very easily.
Brutal
Its fun but ive noticed this last night theres sometimes a slow connection issue i have also noticed sometimes theres a blank after enhancements to crafting essences and servants and it doesn't go into the success. However after i rebooted my phone there was no issue but there was still the slow connection issue. I don't know if this is due to lag or something but can you explain it?
Game will not run at all on a LG G7. That really sucks...
"Amazing story, the gacha itself is pretty rough if you're the kind of wants to collect character. The game can be cleared with the most basic characters, so there's no hard p2w wall for us f2p players o/"
Absolutely love this game!
The graphics are incredible for mobile games and addicting turned based rpg combat.
FGO is a great game and I recommend it.
RUNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Still can't play the game on Android 10
This game have it's up and down when summoning but the story and characters make it up for that and most games wont let you level up a 3 star (because they mostly suck unlike this game some 3 stars servants are actually good) to lvl 100 if you truly like the servant you have so that's a plus.
"The new update will not install. Seriously I really love this game, and now it's a brick."
Not working on OnePlus 6T. It just crashes without opening
LAG
I can't open it on Rog phone2
Its stupid everytime i download it to my phone it won't open up you creators need to fix this right for me to play this game on my s8 plus in order for you to get a five star rating from me you got that
"Cant even load. Click on app, i get a white screen. Errors out. Have a nice day."
"I'm not giving this game one star because it's bad. I love this game, the characters, the story, and the gameplay. I'm giving this one start because of the terrible support when it comes to data recovery. I play this game extremely casually and am sometimes absent from the game for very long periods of time. I have however, invested quite a lot of money into this game because I like it and would like to see it continue. HOWEVER, recently I had some phone issues and was unable to play because the app crashed on startup so I uninstalled it, not knowing that doing so would cause me to possibly lose my account. After re-installing the game I tried to get access back but found that I had no way of doing so and contacted support. To my dismay, I found that their data recovery service is entirely reliant on a user remember many different random things about their account, which, if you do not play the game religiously or remember every detail of your account will cause you to lose your data and start all over. This seems unacceptable to me when so many other games sync with either an account that requires a log in or simply with some other cloud service that saves your game data. While they were thankfully able to restore my data because I had played recently, had that not been the case I could have lost my data. At least in my part I will not be making any more purchases in this game until I can see some sort of resolution for data recovery that is efficient and not reliant on the user's memory. This is frankly an outdated and inefficient method of data recovery."
Gave this 5 stars. Because my luck is great at the game fufu. But seriously dont spend money if ur after the story. Only use money if u wanna get ur waifu or husbando with certainty. Its fun for me since i am just for the story haha.
good!!
The biggest pay to win game ive ever played.
Amazing game for people who enjoy the Fate series.
"Other than the low drop rates and poor account recovery method, I have no other complains. It is a fun, grind heavy game. The issues I had were fixed in timely manner."
"Fun game, if it could actually connect to the server..."
"It's alright, not the best mobile game, story is good at moments with some nice events every year. Personally I prefer epic seven and all it's quality of life features that fate go does not have."
"Alright so not gonna lie. This game is literal gacha hell if you're f2p and get too immersed. Either that or your luck's just garbage, 1 of the 3. I've played for about 5 months now and still haven't gotten a 5 star, though the 4 star character's are generally alright. Biggest rule of thumb from me is definitely to not get too confident, because trust me. You'll be dissapointed a lot if you think you'll instantly have everyone you want."
"Even though its a game of chance this game makes a great job at making everyone at the game good, useful, and a viable choice to use. It may not seem like a f2p friendly game but it is since even 1* servants have their use"
Bad the game all about gambling you pay like 79$ all you get depends on luck most of time i got bad cards i don't why any anime game that has free to play is just grabage game.
Wasn't their fault it didn't work in android 10. Android update fixed it.
The game crashes and doesnt start please help
"Grindy as hell, but a really good campaign, great character designs, animations are starting to get really elaborate, and an overall good experience if you like the Fate series or just want to collect husbandos/ waifus :)"
"Enjoying the content so far, since I'm new to the fate series I see other servants I don't recognize but overall is enjoyable."
THE HELL IS THIS? WHAT'S WITH ALL THE LOADING? IT TAKES 3 MINS OR MORE JUST TO SHOW A SINGLE PULL? THE HECK?
Great games
"I'd rate a 0 if only because I cannot get game to launch. Just opens white window then closes, no error, no reason why."
"The game is fun, but it stopped working after the new android update. Please fix this!"
Now compatible with the new Android 10 update; sp happy I can play it again!! Probably the only smartphone app I've ever found myself actively invested in.
Absolutely love it
"Highly recomended for those who like action, anime, beautiful girls and drama. ;)"
‡πÇ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å
Good character designs
"My favorite phone game by far. Good characters, good stories for the most part. People complain about the rates, but honestly after a year of playing without spending, I'm doing just fine. Only complaint is the horrible support that was given upon the release of Android 10. Missed a month and a half of game play and routine, but so far that's the only issue I've encountered."
It was exhilirating
"Overall a great game. The only con for me is that it loads too long. And once you lose your game data, if on a previous phone, you have to start over from scratch on the new device. Kind of blows because this game is time consuming-- also not to mention if you've spent money."
"Seriously, what wrong with the loading screen time. I just played a few fight and got out of patience waiting, i mean i cant wait a minute for every fight like this even with good connection. I want to enjoy the game but this really ruin the experience"
"Cash grab, and greedy devs. The game to a certain point is heavy to run despite having a very dull and annoying UI, stupid and VERY low quality combat animation. And the worst of all about this game is straight up using EXTREME fanService (almost pornographic) to keep you attached, and suck your wallet dry, basically relying on your sexual addiction instead the enjoyment that this game could provide (it couldn't for me). The story is pretty good tho...that's THE ONLY good thing about this game."
Only for whales. Don try this game if u r not willing to sell your liver to get the heroes you want.
Won't even open if you downloaded the new Android 10 update. Ridiculous how they haven't fixed it yet.
I accidentally deleted the game and when I reinstalled it I lost all of my previous progress. Is there are way to get it back? Because I have no desire to play from the beginning again.
NICE
"A Fate Game....I'm Starting To Get Into ""Fate"", Which Lead Me To This Game. I Will Say That Finding A Character From ""Fate"" That You Like As A Character To Use In This Game Is Very Important, Since Once You Get That Character, Everything Else You Get Via Gacha Ends Up Being A Bonus...The Only Thing I Wish Were Implemented Are A Pool Of 4 Or 5 Star Characters That The Player Gets To Choose From Instead Of Uninstalling And Reinstalling The Game For A Certain 4 Star Character."
Nice game but poor loading üëéüëé
Really enjoy the game and the characters. Only real issue I have with the game is the gacha rates.
Like playing with your dolls but online
"Great gatcha game, very faithful to the original source material"
Nice :3
"I like it... not too competitive, while on the same note, not too collaborative. The friend assist is a really Great Feature"
No comment ....
I love the game! I really love playing this game because it is a lot of fun and im a huge fate/ fan. :)
"This got me listening to raikou and shuten asmr. Good game for the soul, Not for the wallet"
did not start up
"Disgusting, oversexualized art. Bad gameplay, and even worse characters."
It's a gacha but it's fun
"Understanding the tasks, and deploying them, is a bit tricky for those of us that have never played a game like this before. All in all, a good game."
Took more than a month for the android 10 update
I like it a lot but I'd really appreciate it if they could fix a bug where the game will disconnect then just stops working and I can tell it stopped working because the screen would freeze and the music wouldn't stop after I get out of the app
Very nice the game runs very smooth for me and the assortment of characters is wonderful.
A great addicting game where you dont have to pay to get a five star i currently have four and haven't payed a penny
Love the game but doesnt work for android 10!!!
"Gameplay is pretty good, the chracter is good as well. Saint quartz is hard to get (a lot of grinding) and the rate is kind of low. If the company improves this, I'll be addicted to this game."
Rate up may or may not be a lie
"What I read of the story was interesting, that's always a plus. I disliked the battle style and the long load times. There were a few was times I thought the app froze, it just takes quite awhile to load a new screen."
Gatcha hell is real but I want my waifus!
It's one of the more interesting game's I have played
"Terrible Gacha summon rates, endless and pointless farming, horrendous pity system, the global version gets treated like the red headed step child and the animations and artwork are subpar at best. Avoid this game at all costs don't even bother with this trash."
Very good.
"Excellent story, excellent game, excellent events. Absolutely love it, and have been playing since English launch üòÅüëç"
Only 750$ to snag my waifu what a steal!
Great game. 10/10. Love getting angry while rolling for my anime wife png's.
"a fun RPG lite, with a great story, brought to us by the original author Kinoko Nasu. The main plot is fairly serious, but a lot of the side events are pretty funny and goofy. For example, the Paul Bunyan event was pretty comical."
Fun campaign Just campaign though
Gatcha life
"Great way to spend time, no need to spend money!"
"I originally tried this out as a joke from some friends, but the gameplay and way you try to form a team is pretty cool. You can play without spending money just fine though I did out money in due to the fun I had and how fair it was to new players. Definitely recommend if you like darkest dungeon style combat"
Yeeeaaahhhh boooyyyyy
I love this game. My wallet does not.
Finally playable on Android 10. Thanks! üëç
"I love this game so much, as well as the entire Nasuverse."
best game in Fate I've ever played spent more time playing than anything else
Apex Legends
Love the story love the characters but they got to make rates better they also got to make higher tier characters alot better than common characters and maybe add more to the game to keep players maybe like FGO arcade.
Love this game have many five star heroes and have been free to play and events are fun FGO forever
"Android OS 10.0 update erased my data, giving me a new user ID. I didn't have enough info for them to restore my account so I'm out of many hours and 80 bucks spent. Us support is non-existent. Never touching a game by these guys again."
"The story(exept argatha) and characters are amazing , it would be nice if some of the servants got new inturludes but what can you do."
Let me get tomoe to np5
"Love the game, super fun to play. Just wish the team would stay on top of compatibility with OS updates."
Fun to watch the animation
"My tablet has trouble loading this game, galaxy tab 5se"
I love this game! It's always updated and gaining servants isn't too hard. Grindy but fun
Spent over 10k on the game. Very fun
"Lost all my data. They app wouldn't load so I had to uninstall then reinstall which caused me to lose everything that I've worked up till now. I've lost level 5 summons, event only exclusives, everything! I'm not starting from ground zero again that's too much time and money that I've lost. The transfer code and password system did not work for me and now I just can't. Love the game which is why I have it a 2 but I can't start over."
I enjoy playing FGO every day!
Fgo!!!!!!!!! Gachaaaaaaa
Lovely could use better starting summons but an amazing game never the less
"This game was wonderful, and it had a lot going for it, until Android Updates had stopped the game from working. If you're on Android 10, I suggest playing something that works. It's been 2 weeks and no word on any fixes. I'll change my review when they fix so I can play again. Update: I can play after a month! This game is an OG gacha salt and pepper. It has classic turn base combat. The story is very anime, but if it's your jam you will enjoy this sandwich. Don't take the rolls seriously."
Gay. Give me qurstadgy
Lots of fun. You really don't need to spend any money at all to enjoy the game
"Despite the recent update to allegedly fix Android 10 compatibility, there seem to be a large number of people, myself included, who still can't access the game. Needs another fix ASAP."
"Pretty fun game with an amazing story. However, beware the gacha."
"Love this game. Great addition to the fate universe. No ads, and not play to win. Ideal for me."
Sell your soul to gacha. You'll get a great story and 3*s in exchange.
Very engaging without requiring a massive time sink. Able to be played without spending any money without sacrificing the experience at all.
"The game is amazing, the summon system maybe a bit dettering but the game is perfect"
"Amazing over all, just wish there were even slight rewards for fateverse knowledge or something. That would get people to really know fate. Also slightly higher chances or some of the 4‚òÜ and 5‚òÜ"
I love everthing about this game. I just hoped I'd have better luck getting five star hero's lol. Keep up the good work!
We good
"It's a fun game, if a little expensive."
this guy I know named chris. we went to korea together. his entries korean experience was completely warped by this game. he has spent countless hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars on this wasteful app. I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul.
üëåüÖ±
Rate up is NOT a lie
This is one of the best RPGS I've ever played.
"Really good , gets me to watch Fate Series. Only problem is RNG when its already hard to get saintz quartz at high lvl"
The story is pretty good. The gacha can be irritating however and cause you to end up being helpless without support from more veteran players.
üòä
BEST MONEY WASTING FOR WAIFU GACHA GAME EVER
Nasu's writing is awesome.
Super slow but fun.
i spent about the price of a car on this game
The game has a very spectacular graphics..
The perfect mobile game
10/10 Will grind for gems
üáØüáµ
May we all have Luck EX on the gacha.
"I love the game, i hate the gacha."
Fun mobile game 10/10
"This review is written by a casual player with mid-end spec devices. The game have awesome story, characters, and well-balanced. High rarity servants just serves as the dev's income as well as a difficulty reducer for the player. The sad part is, the game's efficiency in terms of gameplay and game engine. It takes almost a minute to load a quest on my 3GB RAM device, 2-5 secs for scene transition or enemy spawns, and no auto-clear system. A big problem for casuals/standard phone users."
It's a fun game if you're good at management and love history.
Bless me rngod
"Mostly about the memes but overall story, gameplay, mechanics, becoming big brain, leveling Cu Chulainn FIRST was great"
rate up sucks!!!
It has a great story and amazing animations
Only mobile game im addicted to
"The new update isn't opening. Love the game, but its just not opening. Sometimes offers to clear chache, sometimes almost gets to 30% of the data update, but always ends up autoclosing. Dont want to risk deleting the app because I dont have my recovery code, just my ID"
You guys are doing well üòä
Dis game is AWESOME!!!
"Very fun, but is a gacha game, so prepare to spend a little money to progress beyond a certain point"
I'll give this game 4* because there's only a 1% chance I'll give you 5*.
Off to epic seven
A great game with an intricate story of the Nasuverse. Fans of the Fate series should give this a try.
A customer service that is incompetent. But I was still aboe to recover my account
If your a fan it a great pick up.
Great game! Looking forward for more Nasuverse fun!
"So I'll start with the downside, and it's one that most ""free"" mobile games have and that it that it is very P2W. However the upside to that is that it isn't as bad as it could be. The game gives you Saint Quartz (The currency used to summon) every day as well as weekly challenges to earn more. Microtransactions are an option I never like, but it never feels necessary. The game has a pretty good story as well as great gameplay! Servants are addictive to collect, highly recommend for any Fate fan"
"Waifus are real, I'm just glad to be able to roll for my favourite characters."
Great. game
"A good game, but I am of those people who don't like gratuitous cut scenes. Before and after every fight! Condensing the number of cut scenes would help people stick it out imo."
"Gameplay is ok at best, just a standard turn based mobile game. I'd advise only playing if you're a huge fate fan if not I would steer clear as the gacha rates in this game are unforgiving compared to other gacha games."
waifu roll simulator has a decent story Edit: Has a very good story after 5th singularity
"A fun, enjoyable game that has easy to use controls and doesnt take long to get addicted."
Good storyline with constant updates and events
Good Game But Gacha Rate is F-Word
Gacha is hell...
"Thank you DW, very cool"
t·∫°ch gacha r·ªìi m√† cx ko ce drop :'(
After playing for a while i realize the spawn rates arent that bad. Especially when have good servants but have a hard time rasing them because you have too many
"My favorite gacha game, even if the rates are abysmal."
"Best Game I played ! Graphics and Animations were great, storyline is the greatest and battle strategy is challenging :3"
Has a good story and an amazing cast of characters. Gameplay is fun but gets repetitive and the gacha rates are insidious. Highly recommended but play at your own risk as their premium currency is very expensive and servant drop rates are so brutally low you can spend thousands and still not get the character you want.
I just like the game
"I am legitimately addicted to this game. I need help and so does the gatcha, we need higher rate ups. A lot of grinding when low on mats or qp, but still really fun"
Great game :)
"For a company that makes $1.8 billion a year from addicted waifu collectors, the lack of immediate Android 10 support is inexcusable. This happened with Android 9 as well. If they make this much money, why can't they hire developers to react and anticipate quicker? This is the only app I have that won't work with Android 10. It's embarrassing, Aniplex. Get your stuff together or I'm pulling the plug on this already geriatric game."
Yes its good ihope so
Needs to be update to Android 10 soon
Love the game but it needs to be updated its unplayable on more recent versions of android.
Won't even open the app. Crashes in less than a second. Why you broke?
Fun game great characters
"I don't care for over-hyped things but it pops up everywhere so I thought I'd give it a try. Low and behold, it crashes as soon as it opens. Looking through the other reviews and how long this has been happening for other players, the silence is an implication of the developer's fervent refusal to fix this issue. Actual customer service seems to be non-existent. I might, though it's not likely, change the review depending on how long it takes them to actually work on this issue from now onwards."
"Can NOT open app, android 10 issue."
"As I played this game, the story really hit me hard and I'm glad that I installed this game."
"Thought I would give this game a try, but it crashes upon start-up on my device using Android 10. Did some research and found that It's been over a month since this all started. Still no Android 10 support or any communication to the players on a fix after all this time?? Doesn't sound like a developer who is too concerned about the players. Yikes. Hard pass."
Doesn't run on Android 10. So I can't tell you how good it is.
The biggest problem I have will always be drop rates even if I'm just going after a 4 star I know I'll never get the one I want then the event for a four star went up and I couldn't use the item
I was pretty far in the game and I just got the servant astolfo so I was really happy too. but then my phone broke and I can't get back into my old account on fgo. I might be wrong but I think there isn't a way to get your account back so I'm very upset. ... but the game it's self is really good I do recommend trying it out just be careful not to break your phone or whatever you use like me.
Terrible reward and developer doesnt give a damn about the player.
So much for the hype. After installing i cant even open it. A send to email pops up. Whatever I choose it still won't open or boot up.
"Played the game quite a while ago and remember it being pretty good. Wanted to get back in for the Halloween Event, but like a lot of reviews on here it looks like the game won't even launch after updating to Android 10. Given how long the Developer Beta was running before release and how long 10 has been out to the public I find this very lazy and unprofessional of the developers to not be supporting the new OS yet."
It crashes its to much if your putting on phone
"Fate GO offers a fantastic story with rich characters that I've actually grown an attachment for. While its rates can be awful, it is clearable by all types of players and gives fantastic event servants to help its F2P player base."
"The story is very extensive and the character art is really nice. The biggest downside to this game is the insane difficulty of acquiring 5 star characters. Overall, this game is great if you have a lot of time to kill and get lucky summoning. As for me, I seem to lack both of those so I respectfully choose to uninstall."
"Can't even get into the game, I try to load it in and it stops"
"Hell, I didn't even got a chance to play the game. It just shuts down every time I open it, but the device doesn't seem that as a crash so I can't find a report or anything"
"It was a great game that I loved playing, however it's lack of compatibility with Android 10 is very disappointing. When it becomes patched to work on the new version of Android I would love to give a 5* review."
"Fate: Grand Order's story is amazing, characters are beautifully designed and all have distinct personalities (though 4th stage ascension art for female servants can get a bit..) and it can never get boring. F2P players, like myself, won't have any problems. Unlike with other RPGs, some of FGO's lower ranked servants can still be more powerful than 4 star or even 5 star servants (Hans, Ushi, C√∫, etc.). Overall a fun story driven and F2P friendly game. Keep up the good work DW!!"
As a free to play person im very disappointed and every time I I draw with 30 Saint quartz all i get is craft essence for my four to five stars instead of a servant so im giving you a one star. You should do it improve on your draw rates or separate servants from craft essence drawls and give the players a choice whether they want to draw for crafts essence or servants
"Loved playing this game, but the lack of urgency in the compliance for Android 10 is just plain unacceptable. Clearly the developer is not interested in moving forward with supporting the game."
"Been playing since launch, love this game to death lol"
"I have to say for a game that has a 4.4 star it sure does keep it's words. I installed the game pretty quickly but as it completed installing and getting ready to press turn app to launch it, boom! My app crashes without me even being able to see the loading screen on my brand new Google Pixel 3 XL.!"
Downloaded the game but it crashed as I open it
1 star because developers still haven't white listed Android 10 leaving people vulnerable. About to miss two months of patching and now there is a zero day exploit that I can't patch to because the devs won't support it. Way to go when you had months to prepare with the beta. They did this with Android 9 as well.
Wanted to try it out because a local con had an event. Doesn't work for Android 10. Can't even open the app. ://
Judy si is jol
"Amazing story, great gameplay, good for downtime"
"I really enjoy playing gotta collect them all, but dang is the game grindy. Which are most free games and having not been here from start means there are some servants that are event locked which I can now never obtain which feels bad."
"It's getting me mad because the app keeps stopping, it won't even let me in it"
"URGENT! App still incompatible with android 10. Since my phone forced the update on 9/20, i haven't been able to so much as open the game, missing out on all the limited time content. Others have been locked out since early August. This is unacceptable, and NA support has not been willing to disclose any sort of ETA when it will be fixed. If you really want to start, i suggest finding emulation tools to play the JP version, which not only plays on Android 10, but is more generous with currency."
great game. still need to get me altera tho ;-;
Game doesn't work on Razer phone 2
Game does not work after last update to android
"Overall great game! But there's no way I can link it to an account so I save what I have. They have a transfer code, but it sometimes doesn't work when transferring. I also got a Pixel 3 and it worked for a time, but now it won't open even after I uninstall it and reinstalled it again."
"Definitely the best story, gameplay, and characters of any mobile game I have ever played. It's even greater, as it manages to capture the visual novel style of the original Stay Night, while also introducing genuine gameplay and fun events. Despite annoyingly low gold rates, it is easily the best gacha game to be released, and a genuine accomplishment for Type Moon."
My fav
Was really enjoying the game until a few days ago it's started crashing every 5-10 minutes with an error code that no one has ever heard of. I've tried everything I can think of to fix the issue and so far the only help I've gotten from support was basically to buy a different phone despite everyone else with my phone saying it works fine for them and it was working fine for me before.
Gacha is hell and I like it
The only gacha game i sticked to
"I love this game (granted I don't play many mobile games) but I updated to Android 10 and well now the game doesn't work ;;-;;. Will there be a fix? I hope so, I wanna play the game again."
I got UMU. 5 STARS!
How is it that this app which has millions of players is never ready for the next Android update? I'm missing the entirety of the current event because FGO doesn't work with Android 10
"I've been playing since launch (around 2 years) and heres my basic one line review: FGO is a good game, just not a great one. Lemme explain. The gameplay is average, story and characters are good for what they are. Its summoning rates are typical for a gacha game though it's usually touted as the worst rates. This is FINE because there isnt any significant competitive edge using rare characters in the game except friend points. And what brought this game to a 3 is support. No Android 10 update!!"
Total lack of Android 10 support 2 months after it's release is unacceptable and lazy.
"As a weeb, this game really entertaning"
Wasting my time (sometimes in a good way!) The character models are fabulous! The gameplay and story are...decent. But any fun I had grinding away for another chance to get more of the beautiful characters and maybe even one if your favorites from the many series is instantly lost when you dont get a single exciting draw again and again and AGAIN. Thankfully the horribly overpriced microtransactions were so insulting expensive that it's easy to not feel tempted to gamble your money away here.
"Technical difficulty. Upon opening app, it immediately tries to open blank email window. Can't play game. Only game/app that I've ever seen do this."
Since the software update for Android I haven't been able to open the app. Please address this
It's a great game of one of my favorite anime franchise. I'm looking forward to seeing the next updates!
"Three star game, RNG critical. Not working since installing Android 10 on my esential phone, so one star now."
The worst and greediest gacha rates in the genre but dammit this is fun
"Very well made RPG. All servants are useful as you can built a team around them. The story gets better as you progress (in my opinion). There is an anime coming on October 2, 2019 about the Babylonia singularity if you want to check out the story for that part. While 5* servants are usually better, you can still make a team around common servants. You just have to be smart with how you play. (I've been unlucky on when I wanted to roll for someone). The gacha can be bad due to the percentages."
Doesn't work on my note 10 plus what gives!
Just a copy and paste game
Really good game I like it and that it probably have over a lot of characters that I can get. Mostly it's one of the best game to play for people that are bored but even so this game can make them play for hours
"WARNING: do not update to Android 10. This app will no longer open if you do. Please Aniplex, patch the game. This game has given me 5* experience since I have downloaded it, but now it no longer functions at all. As others have stated: This rating shall change to 5* once it is patched and works as expected again. Thanks. It was fun while it lasted!"
love all the crazy charecters in the anime and the game a bit to grindy but love the game keep up the good work
"This game needs work. I love the concept, I really do. But, it just runs poorly. I'm playing on a fairly up to date device, and it is still very slow and lags whenever a noble phantasm is used. God forbid if you play this game on normal speed. The rates, well I don't really care about them. They're obviously greedy, but what game company isn't? Even at 1% rates I have 3 5 stars servants, with barely any summoning. Outside of that, the game honestly needs an overhaul for performance."
5* v√¨ ƒë∆∞·ª£c ch·ªã C·∫£i d·∫´n t·ªõi :))
I don't think I've ever had an app that basically made my phone unusable before I even opened it like this one has. For some reason it doesn't work with the LG phones that I've had for a while and it even affects my phones UI just by installing it which again I have never seen on any android app or game ever and I've played from the cheapest knockoffs virus games to high end popular games.
like when it worked
"Game runs horribly on my Moto G4+. Framerate stutters, and the tutorial railroaded me way to long to even see if I could tone down the settings for better performance. It looks like it could be fun, but the downtime between actions and poor performance burned through what little patience I have for mobile games in general. Also, ""summoning"" multiple things forces you to watch a painfully slow unveiling for each individual item, which was the breaking point for me."
"Its a pretty good gatcha game. However there are two big problems I have with it: A) The gatcha system has really low drop rates for how hard it is to get anything. B) The transfer codes only work once, so remember to make a new one every time you need to switch, or else you'll lose all of your progress like I did. If you like the Fate/ series, definitely check this game out."
the only game app i play
Super fun and always something to do. Perfect for fans of the Fate series by Type Moon
Garbage this sorry excuse for a game never loaded up and forced to exit the app when it never lisded up. It's just another scam from low lifes
I also love this game and can't play it after upgrading to Android 10. Sucks!!
"This is a fun game. But i have a serious issue with the AI having abilities we cannot use, such as unrestricted use of skills and the fact that their noble phantasms are a GUARANTIED instant kill where we cannot instantly kill with a noble phantasm in nearly every case. If you are going to give them hundreds of thousands of HP you need to balance that by restricting their skill use by at minimum double the cooldown time of the player's equivilant skill at its level 1."
Still no Android9
"It's ok but I think it's going a little too ambitious when they're trying to give us the JP experience, maybe break that experience and speed up the events just like the other servers. Leave a year of gap or something, that'll be nice."
Its a fun game you have to keep an eye on your servants levels and skills and upgrade them using materials you got from ether the campaign events or training areas which switch by day some events may be block by the campaign for the second campaign is on the horizon starting around dec of 2019 for the NA severer Jp is still a head. Oh ya and do not expect to get your favorite servant off the bat for that set you up for disappointment chill and use the 3 stars if you lucky to get them.
"Incompetent developers that seem to be using a whitelist instead of a black list, resulting in significant delays in supporting Android 8, 8.1, 9, and now 10 and Ios 13."
Best Waifu Simulator
the game is crashing now... i cant even run it... i think its bug or something.. onegai make a hotfix of this..
It a good game from the series
Top rated grossing game on the Play Store but actually unplayable since Android 10 update? It's been weeks and this is getting ridiculous. When I emailed customer service I was told not to take the Android 10 update like this is my problem and not the problem of the game company who is supposed to make sure their titles are compatible with new Android launches. Absolute joke and how you shouldn't run a game.
"im a really big fan of FGO and the anime, I can't wait to start playing this game. This will be a hole new experience for me i rarely play mobile games because of how busy i am"
I love the game so much that i have another account with my another cp. Still one of the game in my phone for over 2 years by now. I dont know why I dont get bored playing this game even though there is a lot of moblie games out there
It's very addicting and just is a good story.
I cant open the game is says: the game is not available in your play environmwnt
"The game was fun to play, and I had wished I still could. But since the app still hasn't been updated for almost a month now for Android 10 users I am losing interest in it. There have been many events that I have missed out on and I highly doubt they will make up for it. I have tried to contact support and have just been handed with ""there's not much we can do about it"" in an email. It's disappointing."
The best mobile game I have ever played period!
Very fun f2p great story and interesting characters
I think it's amazing
"Customer service would not allow me to recover my account even though I gave them a screenshot of my google play transactions with the email I was emailing them from with the GPA. I told them the last time I played the game and the servants I had as well. This game is dead anyways, I recommend epic 7. They have better customer service there."
"I have really been enjoying the game. As with any game of this type, the RNG for character pulls can be very frustrating, but having the highest tier characters generally feels like it's more for preference than necessity. I'm glad I found Fate/GO and I'll probably enjoy it for quite some time."
I play this daily
BAD CIVILIZATION
"No support for Android 10. Fun game otherwise, if you're into Fate/Stay Night gacha."
The game was good very interesting to play i hope you would have a new update thank you
Great game. Great Graphics. Thanks for a Wonderful game.
can you guys add a Google login
imagine playing this game for almost 2 yrs and still couldn't get the servant u want
Can't play it i dont know why it sends me to a email thing I put in my email and it says I can't do it
Fixed the section 11 of fuyuki everytime I play there it force close the game. I can't finished to the other stageüòî
You want free trial in hell? Then come play this game
A long term game.
Gacha is too unfair.
Does not work with Android 10
Aliceüò•
No update for Android 10 yet. Hope the devs get it out soon as I'm waiting to play again.
"The new update has crashed the game twice so far. When I went to summon screen, and at the end of a battle during event."
Pretty fun game
Unplayable on Pixel C with Android 8.1 and Pixel 3 with Android 10.
I just downloaded the game and I can't even open the app. I already redownload the app and restarted my phone but still doesn't work.
not available on pc!!!
Will not run on Android 10
"I've tried installing multiple times and never has it once worked. As soon as the app tries to open it crashes and closes right away. Not even have I seen a display, it has always just immediately closed."
"Literally taken over and consumed my life to the point where when my old phone auto updated to android 10 i went out and bough a new phone, so yea pretty cool game."
Great game for Fate and TYPE-MOON fans but please update this to work for Android 10! It's a major showstopper for many players!
"This game is amazing. It has an incredible plot, and great gameplay. I love playing it, and when I lost my game data, the developers helped me retrieve it. If this is your first time downloading it, you need to get a data transfer code before anything else. Other than that, it is a wonderful game that I suggest you play if you have watched any of the animes."
Got merlin.
Wish there were english voice actors
"Super expensive in-game purchase, Well, your money will be worth it only to Steam games than wasting it on buying quartz."
Honestly way more content then I was expecting from a mobile game. Couldn't recommend it higher if you're a fan of the Fate series.
"I love this game and its characters with great story lines, would definetly recommend"
I was in the middle of a summoning when the app crashed and when I logged back in my saint quartz was gone
Please fix. Ever since I updated my Google pixel the game does not want to start.
Awesomesauce
Instant crash on Android 10. Disappointing
E rank luck
I really love this game but the problem is that I unfortunately updated the game and it now can't open the app
I Got Astolfo ü§óü§óü§ó
"Honestly, I love collecting the characters and reading the story from each level and event. Games where you do not have the option of auto_ing stages are the most engaging. This is one of those games. Amazing illustrations and unique storyline. Have always loved the fate projects."
Love the game but too much of a gamble to get servants.
Expansive story and a slow paced hunt for characters
Freemium garbage
0/5 still no summer jalter rerun
"Wish they cared as much for the EN server as they do Jp, they already updated their game to fix the jp game for Android 10 while leaving us EN servers a few weeks with nothing."
Won't even start OnePlus 7 pro
I LOVE ANMIE SO MUCH
I love this game. However it has just stopped working on my phone. Had to uninstall and reinstall but still no luck
It very enjoying
Can't even pass the new account creation.
After my 4 star review I was blessed with many 5 stars so here you go I'll give one back.
user friendly controls and challenging mechanics
This is literally the best game ever made
"The best, and most fair gacha on the market. Even commons can kick ass with a good strategy. Still a gacha but I recommend it if you have some patience and 15 minutes a day you want to burn."
Its great but damm gacha man its tuff
Does not work on Android 10
Great game but the fact I'm losing my over 100 day login streak for upgrading to Android 10 needs to be fixed and better support never got a response when asking them to fix this three times.
"Best waifu experience, rate up is a lie"
Fate is really good. Would gladly spend thousands of dollars again.
I didn't get merlin
Lots of free contents and you only need to spend money if you want the rare characters. I wish you could skip Noble Phantasms but oh well.
I love nobunaga she is 100000000/10 stars
New update. Still no Android 10 compatibility.
"I still miss my old account but it doesn't mean that I can fight the urge to play this game. I really love it, even though i don't have that much luck on gacha games. I still find it fun and I am still attached to my servants. I miss my old servants too tho, but I love my current ones as well"
"There is actually a lot of effort put into this seemingly cruel gatcha mobile game. the storyline is long and verbose, so if you like the classic Fate/Stay Night visual novel, you will have plenty to enjoy here. On top of that, there are endless free events going on for all levels of player, so you can jump in anytime and get a valuable character to help you through the story."
It's fun and passes the time.
"The more I play this game the more I appreciate how they give all players everything they need to play all content in the game, no money required. Some of the best servants in the game are on the free gatcha, and they regularly have events where you get a free 4 star servant that is usually quite powerful. Plus, even if you spend a lot of money and get a lot of 4-5 star servants, you still have to play the game to get the materials to make them useful."
"I love having choices in dialogue. Most games don't do that and you're forced to play a character that you're not. Thanks, it's so much fun. :3"
mmm very good
"Beatiful game, amazing graphics, I can't wait until global catches up to the japan server."
"The freaking drops, so bad its unbelievable!! Almost 800 quartz, nothing but essense cards and repeats, only 3 four stars, rest 2-3. Just wow...ur money will not take u far, i play it because of the show, just not what i expected. U been warn..."
Very good gameplay fun and great graphics and story.
Doesnt run on my lg aristo.
Excellent üëçüòÄüëå
A download glitch keeps happening when trying to download the Moon Festival event
Love playing this game! It's my favorite moble game with beautiful art.
Fate for life
Fun if you're a fan of Fate. The gacha rates are not great though.
Rate-up isn't a lie :pepega:
I wish there was a pvp arena but otherwise a very fun game with amazing visuals and amazing hand drawn artwork in all of the cards. Again the only low point is that there is only one way to interact with other players and that is by sharing servants.
"Got what I wanted, lol. Its easy! Just get lucky."
Its an amazing game its just laggy but its good
Evil app that i still play regardless....
"No game has ever been so brutal at gacha system to the point that people are wasting their 4 month rent just to get a servant,people breaking down in tears not getting them and people raging as they swim in salt seeing people get them this game is brutal,evil and can destroy families,friendship and relationships...10/10 would waste money again and again"
My dreams of waifus and husbandos achieved!üëåüëåüëå
Gacha pull is BS
"I loved this game. I easily put almost a hundred hours in. I had most of my favorite servants from the light novels, but I can't access my account anymore. There should really be an option to bind it to an email address so you don't lose all your progress like I did. I don't even want to play anymore cause I had already gotten so far in the story quests."
Best gatcha game ever
"This app can be a pain in the ass on times because of it's chances for getting a five or four star servant, but in the end, I love it. It always makes up for things like that. I can't give it less than five stars."
Heaven in a game
Would say better about it its fun but the summoning rates are so low you can get 40 things and none of them are gonna be a five star
I feel like I am in a real anamade
Best wifus
"Bad pull rates, good waifus."
Get waifus and destroy your wallet's laifu. What's not to love?
"I don't understand how people let randomized drop rates affect their ratings... It's a gacha game; if you dislike gacha games you probably won't like this. The rates are exactly as advertised; while I hate not pulling what I want as much as anybody else, I got exactly what I signed up for. Re: the game itself... I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who isn't a Type Moon fan already, and the story isn't up to the standard seen in a lot of other Nasuverse works, but it still offers a lot to enjoy."
"never paid attention to the fate series before, but after seeing someone i follow online hype about this, i just had to check it out. and so far, i am utterly absorbed. i'm having a lot of fun and the game helps me destress. wonderful story, a variety of characters WITH voice acting, beautiful art and interesting gameplay."
It is one of the best game i ecer 0layed in years
The best game I had ever played
This is one of the best Fate/ games out there
Tasteful waifus
"Its been a blast! You get pretty cool servants quick enough and then doubles to power them up. Story is intriquing cant wait to compare it to the show! All in all, bravo."
Rate up is a lie. Still fun though
Would love to be able to play it again put for some reason they still haven't updated it to be compatible with Android 10 or the new IOS. I guess when you're the top grossing game you can stop caring about customer support üòë
Great game I love it
umu!
"Took all my money, but got my 2d waifus"
Moedred is best
"There's a lot to dislike about FGO, the gacha rates are cartoonishly bad, the game is stingier than any other mobile game I've ever played, and loading and battle can be incredibly slow at times. I still feel like I can endorse it despite all of that though, because the story and characters are so charming and pleasant that there's plenty to do and see even if you can never even get close to any of the rare characters you might want."
"I got merlin in my first week of playing, thank you Aniplex <3"
Good game i really like it
"The game is great and one of my favorite. Beautiful art, solid gameplay and a good story. It's a game for those who have lots of time and those who just hop on once a day."
The developers doesnt believe me I want to recover my account and i forgot some of its info. I given the screenshot and even my purchase history and they didnt believe! What a system
The Gatcha is a fickel mistress Pepega
Took me a lot of reinstall to finally love both the game and anime. One of the best games ive ever played in my phone and probably the only game ill be spending money on UwU
"After playing a different phone game of similar style I can say: the load times are insane, the drop rates are inane, and I have to press update support list like 6 times per battle to get my friends list to actually show my friends."
Love the game and card designs.
Fan of the anime.
Best gacha hell game ever
I love playing this games
"Pretty good so far, very grindy and luck based, Maybe increase the chances of getting good servants or decrease Saint Quartz usage for summons by like 5 or 10"
Waste of valuable time
"I had hoped this latest update would make the game work on Android 10. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to. Dropping another star."
"This is a nice game, the story is nice, the gameplay is nice and there are voices for every character in the game. Only thing is, the low chance to get a 5 star servant. But that does not bug me cus its mainly on upgrading. Nice Job!"
Great game. No need to spend money on the microtransactions. Just play the story and events.
"NOT Pay 2 Win. In fact, the only reason you would be paying for this game is to support the game and get that certain character for yourself. The main story and events can be finished with 1-3 star servants. Speaking of events, some events gives a free 4 star Servant for compensation if you ever get unlucky with your rolls. That said, no matter how unlucky or lucky you get with your rolls, you won't find the need to compete to get the best servants available since there is no PvP."
My favorite game!!!!
Dabicapped
The game's fun and the characters are great however it feels like it's not very free to play friendly and geared towards those who would invest money into this game
It is a incredibly fun game that supports free to play. though if you miss a event and its rerun you have no chance to redo it... that is the only problem I can think of
Love Fate and I enjoy fgo
"Good story. Good and memorable historical figures made into anime characters. Simple, yet deep gameplay. Overall, a really good game with a good community. Only downside is the gacha and it's not so great rates, but the game is still very good and playable besides that."
I go to update my game and it uninstalled itself what the heck
"Aside from the abysmal roll rng, the game has a solid structure. Some of the best servants in the game are given to you after completing optional events. I found the Remnant singularity arcs have better stories than the original story. I think the QoL has dramatically improved since launch and there is so much free stuff you get from login bonuses."
"A really great game. There are seasonal events all year, strong servants, top of the line craft essences. All 'round its an amazing game and worth the time"
Damn you gacha gods. Holding my wallet tighter than my belt to my waistline
"I have been dying to play this for a very long time ever since the Jap version came out. I'm a very big fan of the Fate series and playing this game has been the greatest enjoyment I've had recently. Good gameplay that does not rely solely on rarity but of team composition and timing of actions where one is forced to plan more than two turns in advance. Not too hard nor too easy, it is a very enjoyable tactical TRPG made to be enjoyed by both the fans of the series and gamers."
4 summon tix and alrrady got merlin. Love it
wish me luck :)
Good game but rate up is a lie
"It's based on Fate/Stay Night, what else can be said about it?!"
its great (give us more qp)
Best Gacha Period
It's Great Game... My Only Problem is The Gatcha..
"This is my most played mobile game, I was hooked on day one. Just wish when using the special ability it wasn't as laggy. I love this game no matter what and the anime was just as good."
One of the most enjoyable games ever wih it's interesting plot and the low winnrates makes you even happier when you manage to get a 4/5 star servant
Loads of fun though very farm heavy.
"The gacha is merciless, but the game is still pretty fun. The plot's good and teaches you a little IRL history too."
"Censored content, poor English at points, whitewashed characters"
I cant pull Merlin.
Awsome sauce
Good time waster
"I'm a fan of the Fate series, and have been playing this since the start of the original JP server. Finally having an English translation of the game is a really enjoyable experience, instead of having to rely on wikis and fansites for translation of the material from the JP server."
"Out of all the games iv ever played on mobile, only 2 have stood out as being actually great games; Tales Of Link (Rip) and this one. FGO is a shining example of a game where being f2p isnt a death sentence. All sevants have uses from the low 1 star to the highly sought after 5 stars. Being a masdive fate fan its really cool to play this game to set combos that would never exist in universe. Thats why its a 5* game to me. Its just that great."
"Engaging characters, well done plot, and frequent events all make this game great"
GIB MORE SSR PLES
Sasuga Greg sama!
it has waifus and its good
I'm enjoying it right now to give it 4 stars. Although rates are still very bad. Not for people with horrible luck. I just offset my bad luck with more $$$. Careful not go so deep down the hole just to regret it later.
Fantastic game! I like how it combines card battles with a visual novel. Impressive story and good battles too. Just wish it wouldn't crash so often. EDIT: This game crashes way too often. Lowering to 3 stars. Good luck if you have a low quality android. It's also my only game installed.
Gameplay is really enjoyable and rewards high-iq team compositions even with f2p servants. Spending money is optional and the gacha rates are at least in my opinion okay. Some of the lower rarity Servants have meh animations and some of the skills did not age well at all but ytill a good game nonetheless.
My daily login is ruined due to the Maintenance times so now I will never get the reward for the 7mil campaign. Not to mention the game lags way more than the Japanese version which shows little to no lag for me.
"Gave it 2 stars cause i cant play it, i emailed support about my issue and its been a month now and they havent replied.. the game hangs whenever a noble phantasm attack is used.... would give it a 1star but im a big fate fanboy"
"3 weeks in, and still not compatible with Android 10. Top game on marketplace, but you can't play for a month after each new OS update?"
This game is for gay weebs like quinton
"Rates are bad. Really baffling that for months that there is no single sr or ssr that I had received. And you think rates are bad? It gets so much worse. Gameplay is dogshit, really dogshit. No nerfing of op servants (lmao). Power creep for every month of new servant. UI is bad, game engine is old, and everything is trash. Worse than summoners war ill give you that"
i really love playing this game but i just updated to android 10 and this game doesn't work anymore. I still haven't used my free 4* servant ticket. It's frustrating when i can't log in and the ticket has a time limit to be used.
Its really bad just a clone
Gl getting for Waifu!
The rate up is an lie other than that good story but much grinding so ill watch the movies so if its not your thing thats fine but as a fan of fate its pretty good.
xoesnt work with Android 10
Is sad when Root device are not support :'( Am love play this game but am now using root so good bye FGO :'(
"Repetive, boring content. Bad rates with tons of grinding. Sos get me out of here."
"Gacha System game, but, enjoyable"
"I love the game! It has a lot of different colorful characters with different abilites and stats, and their stories tells us who they are and such. The only problem with this game, it doesnt have a character selector ticket system, like week one you get a ticket, and week 3 you get a ticket. The stars are on certain weeks like first week you get a 4 star, and the third week you get a 5 star. So i hope you add this system one day."
"I never expected to enjoy this game as much as I have, so much so that I have several accounts including on JP. Let me preface this by saying that this game is not pay to win and everything can be beaten as F2P with a bit of ingenuity. The story is great, and got me back into reading. I learned myths and histories of characters and places I would have never heard of otherwise. Combat is simple enough to grasp, but continues to evolve. Definitely worth your time, just don't whale."
10/10 Gacha HELL.
Great game. Mega greedy MTX tho. Not worth spending money on.
"FGO devs didn't prepare the app for Android 10 release. I can't claim my 4* unit and will miss the opportunity because of their negligence. I'm out, don't think I'll continue playing this game given the atrocious rates, poor support, and weak currency rate."
salty but good
It gud
"I was trying to get back into the game after a hiatus and I soon figured out o couldn't even log in. Something about the Android ten update. Since it hasn't been fixed and the game won't run, I won't even be able to use my ticket for a free 4 star. Kinda disappointed."
Its rigged
"Great Character Design, Great Gameplay And Nice Story! Totally recommend playing this if you haven't yet!"
"One of the best gacha game, you cant get all the servant but thats the beauty of uniqueness. The graphic still one of the best compared to other ugly chibi 3d sprite, although more and more graphic oriented game started appearing namely *p*c7 All in all gud stuff, be proud of your Chaldea servants"
Loved it. It's a very addictive game and I've been playing it since a year ago everyday nonstop.
OOF
"dont get me wrong, the game is fun and all, its just how you get servants is very predatory towards the player. Saint quartz (the summoning currency) is a bit difficult to get and you can buy it, to get servants from events or some 5 star units is very difficult. it shows you the percentage of getting these units and some are a bit crazy like 0.700% chance in a pool of 200 items"
I have MASSIVE CACA WIFI
Its a great game but i camt use my 7 mill summon ticket the event doesnt even show up when i look for it and ive completed singularity f
"For some reason, events that happen in the davinci shop dont appear until after the event ends."
"The game is good, though for the free sr Servant event right now, i cant seem to exchange my ticket. Any suggestions?"
10/10 would waste money for png voiced waifus :3
Im addicted run before its too late!
Loading time is too long
Censored games deserve zero stars.
11 Merlins from 10
"If you love this series then you will love this gameüòÅüëçüèæüí™üèæHowever...when you summon using your crystals it is a rare guarantee that you will get the person you're looking for, so be careful when paying for crystals. Even though it says drop rate highüòì... I spent plenty of money and came up with 0 5 stars, but overall a great game to playüòÅ üí™üèæ"
I have always loved TypeMoon for creating fate. FGO lets me interact and learn more about the servants I love so much! I will continue to support this wonderful game even if I get minimum rolls!
"Cool game like , enjoyable Great game has some of my favorite servants like Nero , artiria , mordred"
Great game if you love Fate and want to experience more of the Nasuverse story.
"The game is great overall. Amazing Noble phantasms and graphics, iconic characters from the fate series and so muvh more. But there is one issue that keeps me from rating it at 5 stars. Ive been getting this log in issue where i was able to log in and play yesterday but yet today i cant log in and im stuck on a black screen after the white starting screen where the loading doesnt show up. I dont know if this is a bug or not but please for god sake fix your bugs"
Turn off USB debugging. I guess they're afraid of cheaters. Why not make progress server-side?
I love the game it is so much fun with amazing characters but I have ran into a problem. With the ticket event going on it won't let me use it. I cleared Singularity F like it said I need to and when I go to Da Vinci's workshop and click on event it doesn't show. I look through my items and I have it.... What do I do?!
"Amazing story, characters and gameplay. Although the rates are abysmal for SR and SRRs, you can get through the game just fine with the lower rarity units. Overall one of the best gacha games I have ever played."
5 stars! I hope i could get one ;c
Useless app. Can't even adapt fast on the latest android version. If I could rate 0 star I would..
"The game tries to open up with paypal or gmail...& i can't seem to even open it at all, downloaded multiple times."
"""Connection to the downloading server has been lost. Would you like to retry?"" Selecting the retry option just freezes the game forever and I have a decent internet connection.. Can't even get past of the tutorial because of this. Fix this"
"Honestly it's epic!! I'm really glad that they made the anime fate grand order, fate zero,fate apocalpse...and so much more! I'm really glad that they added every single character. The only thing I recommend is that there should be Pvp,guilds,and a chatting system other than that it is amazing!! I recommend it to fate fanatics."
"Every year when a new version of Android comes out, this is the only app that doesn't work. Android 9 it took them almost a week to fix. It's been almost a week since 10 came out and it still doesn't work. Every other game I've tested works fine. Over 20. It's only. This. Game. Drop rates are also really low and prices high. Gameplay not that good tbh. Combat is dull. Play it for story or not at all"
"Probably the best gacha game in the mobile market right now, I would have given at five out of five but right now I found a bug. This bug is not allowing me to use the free 4 * voucher ticket to get the 4-star servant even though I completed the first main storyline to use it. I don't know I'm the only one are there others like me?"
The game will not launch any more after the Android 10 update that pushed early this month
I cant exchange the event ticket .
This game is really funny and you need a luck to play this game :D
"5/5 if you're a fan of the Fate series, or even just TYPE/MOON in general. If not, maybe 3.5/5."
"Been a week since Android 10 update on pixel 2 xl, still no update while other gacha fixed with in a day to a few days... C'mon just when I was just getting back into it"
"Enjoyable, however the game has started crashing at startup right after I updated to Android 10. Uninstalled and reinstalled, game will not run anymore."
Connection always gets disconnected even with stable connection. It will prompt me to retry to return to the game but if I tap retry button it will just get stuck on that window prompt so I need to close and restart the app. Please fix.
This is my favorite mobile game.
I have Singularity F done yet I can't use the exchange ticket at Da Vinci's shop bc there's no banner is that an error or something?
7 million exchange not showing up in da vinci shop
Excuse can you answer? how do you use the 7million downloads ticket that are given? pls explain in simple steps. :)
Great game overall but fp has almost no use so I have over a million if not over a billion so if you add a better use or just a type how many you want to summon button I'd say it's a five outta five. Also maybe add material from past events in there as a super rare drop I have a few servants being useless due to not being able to ascend them just a suggestion though.
Please update this game for Android 10
"The game is fun but my phone recently pushed an update to Android 10 and the game will not launch. The same exact thing happened during Android 9 launch and it took weeks for the fix. As fun as this game is, the support and service for this game is so disappointing....you'd expect so much more from the #1 grossing gacha on the market."
"As a fan of the fate series, all i can say is that this is give this game 6 stars of i could."
Used 900 sq and didn't get Merlin. Rates are bad so not worth trying.
I earn my 30 saint quartz and i spinned it and the game crushed and eat my quartz and i don't recieve any summoned so pls fix this and thank you
"I have always been a fan of the the fate series, and this game is a wonderful adaptation of it! It's just frustrating that earning saint quartz is so tedious and takes a while"
"Slow servers, didn't even roll my waifu, but stories are interesting"
The graphic still stuttering a little despite my old phone already fulfilled the recommendation. But overall it's a fun game.
The game is good. I love the story and the side stories of the characters. I cant wait until more content comes out.
"Y'know it's actually not that bad if you don't include the gatcha rates. You can farm most SR servants from events and rerun and during download events you get a free SR ticket. All the servants are pretty balanced as low tier scale up 1-3. If your starting the game fresh you might see some difficulty but with this game, but the longer you play the more free stuff your going to be building up to make up for the pay wall. In the future I hope they can give out a free SSR ticket tho prob unlikely."
"Why dont you add a system for every 100,000 friend points you can exchange for a single saint quartz"
had an issue with my account and was greeted quickly and friendly and they were more than willing to help and solve my problem. thanks again. The only actual complaint I have is the the whole transfer code. I just got a new phone and i have put plenty of money into this game and since I got a new phone I cant access my account due to not having the transfer code. If we could get like a fb sign in or a gmail or something to make it easier to recover our accounts.
"As much as they promote f2p it's sadly p2w. Just the fact that the most 
groundbreaking and wanted servants are behind a gacha lotto.it requires a 
lot of time and real world money."
Uninstalled reinstalled game doesn't start anymore keeps crashing was working before recent update T-T
All games essentially work on android 10 but this one decides not to open. I know we were given notice about the incompatibility but the devs were also given advanced notice about android 10 as well. Honestly just shows how lazy the devs can be on this game.
Game is really good and interesting I do have a problem with the save account that needs to be changed. Overall I do love and enjoy the game and it's store.
Its nice but they could make a bit easier to get summon crystals
I have tried repeatedly to download and play this game to no-avail. I've confirmed that USB debugging is not on. Not sure if this is due to the recent Android 10 update. But a fix would be nice as Fate is one of the best series out right now. Edit: This is definitely due to Android 10 update. My wife had 9 still and I tried the game on her phone and it worked fine. It wouldn't work on a fresh install after I updated her phone. Let's fix this please.
It discared
Very good quality but can u add more servant
"Would be better if it wasn't so focused on paid rolls, but it still viable for f2p just wont get all the best people."
Everything
i love fate
"The game itself is really fun, but I can can't give it a good review because of the terrible localization. Not only do they change character art for no good reason, but they also change the translations of character dialogue, sometimes butchering the characters completely."
"It's a really good game, especially if you're a fan of the franchise. The battles can get repetitive, summoning from the gatcha is really hit or miss, even with rate ups on event banners. Overall, great game, just not one you should play if you want fast progress."
I rate this app Saber/Saber.
"Fun so far, but during first bit of campaign, mobile coordinate No. 0, section 11, the game keeps Force Closing after the cutscene. One Plus 7 Pro."
Crashes on open on Android 10
4 star 3woooooooooooooww
Unfortunate doesn't work...
bad
"The game is fun and all but the thing that bugs me is that you can't link the game data to your social media platforms, stuff like facebook, instagram or whatever you happen to be using. I recently lost my phone, which I also saved my transfer code in and neglected saving the code on another device, and now I can't get my data back. If the game devs are reading this could you please help me recover my account?"
Its a very good game just dont focus on getting 5 stars
"I've rated it 5 stars, free gems pls"
"Great waifus/husbandos, BEST in the industry! The customer service is too notch too, actually saved Nerofest for me by getting me a transfer code in a timely fashion when my phone updated itself to Android 10! As with all gachas you should expect some heartbreak wheb going f2p, but it's more than doable with patience and good ol' 2 year NA foresight."
I recently lost my original account but I remember having so much fun with it that I'm redownloading it to run back my stuff and I doubt I'll regret it.
"Can't even play the game, it keeps on crashing for no reason. Don't download this game, it's a waste of time."
"Terrible UI, horrible gameplay and progression and disgusting behavior towards their players."
"The game itself is amazing, the only issue i'm having is with the whole ""Data transfer"" method. I've entered both the transfer number and my password many times and for some reason it keeps telling me it's incorrect, otherwise I had a fun time playing."
Won't run since updating to Android 10.
After Android 10 update the game wont open up at all
The game is really fun and easy to play. My only complaint is that you more or less need the cash shop to get the full experience.
First I left a bad review bc I had been locked out of my account for over a month. Well the support just helped a day or two after me making this post so I'm giving a different review and higher rating because the game is good but the developers must understand there ability to help the players is also a big part I would give 5 but the wait time was truly annoying
"The rare servants are extremely to get, getcha is bad civilization, inceease the drop chances of ssr cards"
Cant even play it. Keeps crashing or doesny even open smh
doesn't work on android 10.
DOES NOT WORK ON GALAXY S9+ . Please help me fix this issue!
P2w with low chance even if u oay
The story is top tier!!! Must play!
For fate degenerates who love their waifus
The Best
i love this game :0
"It is a fun game to play, but the app itself takes up enormous amounts of space and has awful load times. It constantly requires updates which also takes up more and more space like the very hungry catapillar. Additionally, to make the game even playable with the wait times, you have to download even more data so it will be preloaded, but a lot of the data you download will likely be never needed anyway what with how much stuff is in this app."
"It's really sad that they ruined this game. Because i enjoy fate but they had to go screw this up! Garbage summoning rates, it take a long time to level up servants."
Love this game you guys make this hella good and fun keep up the good work
<3 i love meltryllis
it was nice but it dose not play after sabers move it just stops at blanck. And i cant play it is just goos back to home screen.
I love the story.
Don't download... Gacha Hell... Be...wa...re...
Loving the salt! Keep it up!
"I love this game and really like,but there is one thing I hate the saint quartz is really hard to get,can make it easier to get saint quartz"
doesn't work...
Good good just really grindy and ridiculous greedy don't buy for anything in this game. You will be wasting your money into a game that wants more money than player satisfaction. I REPEAT DO NOT PAY FOR A DAMN THING!!
It's an amazing game... The gameplay and story was smooth and entertaining... Keep up the good work
I farm so much saints quartz and I still don't get anything good and would rate 0 stars if I could.
Won't even open with Android Q beta. Used to enjoy the game but haven't been able to play it almost all year since the Q beta released.
Amazing game. From the characters and their NP'S to the story and the fights
It's an Amazing Game
I lost my account and didn't have my transfer code. Their customer support team retrieved my account within two days. Great service and game üò•
it sucks
Hands down one of the best phone games.
No multi-player aspect but good game.
5 stars cuz i have one 5 star
"FGO GAME SO GOOD! They have quality sounds, voice and cute characters umu recommended for Fate Series fan."
I spent over $200 on anime jpegs
Why not ?
Like Brave Frontier with slightly tweaked mechanics and more relatable characters. Nicely done. Standard grjnd'n'gacha fare for the most part.
Super fun game to spend some time on.
"This game is amazing, it kind of reminds me of a final fantasy kind of setting and it's got a lot of cool characters like Gilgamesh and Nikola Tesla, I just can't wait for Napoleon to come out :3"
"It's an amazing game! I do reccomend you watch the anime to understand more and to be more immersed, but regardless it's a great Gacha game with a HUGE fan base."
Red all the way
"Used to be super upset about the cost of paid Sants Quartz. However, the rate you can accrue apologems and other types of free Saints Quartz have made me feel better about the price they charge. I love the depth of this and how it adds to the Fate universe so I've got no complaints now."
Okay.
"Fun game, always a joy to meet intresting characters in historical settings, plus with lots of events there is plenty of content. The in game currency is a bit stingy, but not excessively"
"I have no idea what the game is like because it refuses to run on my third party phone (Honor 6X, for anyone wondering) which seems to be a trend for any smart phones not considered to be ""first party"" phones. I'm definitely not going to shell out money just to buy a phone that actually runs it, so the change will need to be on the devs' end if they want a proper review. Edit: The phone is now supported, thanks!"
5 out 5 stars it takes your money for the waifus you want to collect
Awsome Game. Great work!
I think even if your not a fan of the fate series like me you should at least try it once newcomers it's actually a really good game especially if you like gacha games and visual novels the plot of the story is 10/10 so far you really going to want to grab some popcorn once you get to the seventh and final singularity though lol so hit that install button
"Excellent game. You dont have to spend money to have good characters, money just expedites the process"
"I love the game, I'm a big fan of the Fate series. Hoping you make more/new servants, maybe more alternate forms of existing one's ^-^"
Quite wonderful :> Brings back a lot of memories from the series UvvU Gameplay is quite nice as are the graphics. Nice work
Good Job Fate
I have spent 600 dollars rolling for joan.. still don't have her..... cri 5/5
"It's gotcha, but it's a gotcha with soul"
I dont like the constant updating
Idk why my friends even asked me to try this the drop rates are terrible. Uninstalling this waste of time and money lol i have better drop rates in Fire Emblem Heroes.
I'm giving this a 5 star rating so the Gacha will finally give me a 5 star.
"Been playing for over two years actively on two accounts. I love this game, and the Fate series overall."
"Slow and clunky app, what are the jp devs even doing lmao. Gameplay is incredibly slow and grindy, every single event is a slog if you're trying to go for the bare minimum. Story isn't good enough to put yourself though the bad gameplay."
Lots of fun
"Best gatcha out there, that is if you like the fate franchise, if not then you will learn to love fate. Other than meh drop rates for high rarity servants and draining your irl wallet its really fun."
This is great. It really helps me to learn about the fate universe. The graphics are amazing and the story is impressive.
I love the fate series. You can tell that the people who made this had love and respect for both the serious and parody tones the series take. You can tell they had fun with this.
Takes up a lot of room in my phone but its worth it tbh
10/10 Would roll for waifus again.
The Waifus and Husbandos are good
"Been playing for close to a year now. Not rating 5 stars, since this game is not perfect. I play pretty casually and maintain loging in for daily rewards. But I've been lucky to save and get some good 5 star servants. Quartz are pretty grindy, but if you save and play casualy, free2play isnt terrible. Combats pretty fun, load times can depend on device/connection and there's a lot of story to invest with. Never gave a review before, but overall imo the game is worth trying."
Good game. Rate up can be frustrating some times.
Good game amazing story and the characters are all useful but summon rates kinda suck unless ur super lucky
"The game has a surprisingly good story and characters! But the draw rates are TERRIBLE. Lower star character can totally be viable, but getting 5* is incredibly rare. Kinda wish rates were better."
"This game is awesome and the best game i'd ever played but its suck because my favorit character has the lowest max attack of 9,906 (Charles henri sanson) . over all its still the best"
"My favorite mobile rpg (despite the crappy drop rates). I enjoy the stories and the characters quite a bit, but take that with a grain of salt as I was a Fate fan before this game came out."
Gacha hell... But totally worth it üêß
Gacha sucks sometimes but its better and more fair than most mobile games
"I love this game, I've played the Japanese edition for a while. So I was ecstatic when we finally got it for North America. To be able to play this fantastic game in my native language is so nice! Having a translated version of Fate/GrandOrder [albeit a little bit behind japan] is five star worthy me. The visuals are amazing, i specifically love the animations for the noble phantasms and as mentioned earlier, a translated game means I can enjoy the great stories F/GO has to offer."
Game's fun.
It's a really fun time sink.
The power
"i really love this game and i've been playing it for a long long time, it's just so sad that the drop rates for assension materials are just so imposible. i super love fate but this is just so frustrating..."
Gacha Hell but easy to become heavily invested in the characters and story
"Good game, one of the best gacha games out there and would recommend 100%, but could you do something about the unusually long loading screen time, even for high end specs phones, it takes a considerably long time to load each time even after downloading all the content, im using android 9, is there any issue with the game and android?"
Fun ... gacha is hell though
I LOOVEEEE ITTTTTTTTTTT
Welcome to Gacha Hell
"Didn't roll my favorite waifu, time to end my laifu."
Game is super fun and personally i dont have to much gatcha salt
Nice and fun gatcha game. Can pay or play for free.
"Great, the combat is pretty fun, it has a good story as well as some pretty amazing art for each of the servants."
Summoning rates are bad and seems to not change. Story is good and is one of the best on mobile. Problem starts with story locked events due to the long story which becomes a chore to do after a while. As much as i like the game forcing a player to rush through story to do events isn't fair. I would like to enjoy doing it in my own pace.
I will fix my review as there is a small note that needs to be added do not run this game with usb debugging on if you transfer devices. Solid game even though gatcha rates are bad some of the lower rarity servants shine when given the love they need. You can beat the game with what they give you. Some of the event 4 stars surpass 5 stars. Just play how you like and enjoy the ride for the story. Don't overlook any servant some can surprise you.
Kept me from committing suicide for 115 days+ already
It's a fun game. It's a bit grindy to get stuff to summon servants though. Overall it's a good gacha game
Gacha hell that appeals to the nerd in you
"This is my first time playing this game I have so much trouble with it! First, loading is take too long. How can only this game on my phone like that but any games like PUBGM looks fine?! Second, chance to get SSR is so impossible! No new player summon! Third those material to upgrade servant is impossible and takes long to get!"
150 quartz and no Umu...
Busty waifus everywhere!
It's alright...
I'm in gatcha hell. Help.
Fergus is my best sabre in the game because gacha.
Love the game! I've been following fate series ever since I was still a kid.
It's a mobile rpg with gacha. You probably know if you're into this already. You collect husbands/wives/children and level them up to make them cooler and sometimes they go racing or something like that
"Yay, I really like this game, all the game instruction, animation, storyboards, all great. But I was bit disappointed due to the summoning system, i didn't get any Saber (except Bedivere) and not that much Berserker (I have Kiyo and Chacha). Well anyway my player name is Yuna and I have finished Agartha and still fighting in Shinjuku (I'm still a weak Master but I still my strategy enclosed to me). And also I used my mom's phone and account (I wish I could have a phone and transfer my g data)."
best game for those who avoid toxic gamers hahaha
Cant play. it crashes on start. already sent a message. help.
It's a living hell but I need them waifus
"I've played for 2 years, no pvp is the reason I'm sticking to this game despite crappy gacha rate and stingy saint quartz. Would give a 5* if the devs are more generous in handing out summoning currencies (saint quartz and tickets)."
"If you are here, odds are you already know what this is. If you are wondering if it is as good as you think it will be, odds are that it will be better."
Read the source material you casual scrubs
10/10 Would blow a paycheck and nut on .jpeg again
GACHA SUCK
Boom
great game. story is absolutely superb. game isn p2w at all and im strictly f2p. not having all 5stars characters doesn't impede gameplay at all
Wish they changed the puppet animation
I've been playing this game for a couple of months now and I still haven't gotten a single character above a 3 star character. Unless I actually pay for saint quartz. The character rate for 4/5 star servants is atrocious. on top of that the craft essences are in the same pull as the servants instead of being in a separate pull. I've loved this game up until this point despite what people say about it. But I can't keep trying to farm for saint quartz anymore trying to get servants I wont even get.
game refuses to even open. it just instant crashes galaxy s9 on P and pixel 3 on Q
Now all we need for it to bring great happiness is Saber Lion. Gao!
"The game is pretty decent but this game just won the worst gatcha awards in the history of games, my god 0.1% chance to get a 5 star hero (sigh). Could you atleast be a bit nicer to players and raise the percentage of getting a decent hero. Not everyone is filthy rich to buy crystals you know. If you take my advice and raise the freaking percentage im sure you'll get tons of new players."
Gacha is a disease.
"Loads too long and many and much of the loading, tho i like the graphics."
"Just started the game. Was able to download the added content. Was able play it for few hours, and then it crashed! I relaunch it. It says unable to connect to server. I cleared cache, restarted phone and even reinstalled it. You what i got after reinstalling? I have to update/ redownload the the added content! So annoyed that i have to redownload it again and again."
Meh gameplay was boring. Can't win me over on good story alone.
Long loading time
I love the game its fun and a great story with awesome characters
Glorified slot machine wifu style.
It's a pretty good game. Gacha sucks but that's just a how most of these games are
Bloody amazing many people are saying it is pay to win but spend a good solid half our and you will get lots of saint quartz
"it's good and all but the transfer issue is the problem it's complicated and I lost my ishtar,altera and kiara"
I Cannot play this game error code 61
Fun and addictive
this game is not fair
The loading and connection take longer then the fighting. Look more like a loading game. Epic fail. Fastest uninstall game. 2 day
"This game is trash. It lags to the point of being unplayable, and the rates are garbage."
"With a lot of the complaints of horribly low 5 star character rates, a new complaint from me. I can no longer get the game to run on my phone."
"Love the game, a must have for a fan!"
My life is ruined
"Lost my data. Game wouldn't load so I uninstalled it and did a redownload. Same phone, same Google account. I even spent money on here so I thought it would remember my info along with me moving it to my SD card. Story's interesting but gameplay and text speed is to slow for me to be motivated enough to restart."
"The game is great, but i wish the CE and servants were in their own separate draws to make it easier to acquire whatever you need/want. Also the draw rate could be better out of all honesty."
Although this games gatcha system is beyond trash (mainly bc 90% of your pulls will be CEs) it has an amazing story and gameplay is easy and fun. The animations arent bad either
Now I know why i don't play Grand Order so much they make it harder to get servants by putting them together with Craft Essences they should have them seperate to make it easier for those who want servants.
"If you are a fan of the series, chances are you want a certain 5 star character. But unless you are willing to drop a couple thousand dollars during a rate-up of said character, you won't. The game is ""generous"" enough to give you quite a bit of quartz for gacha, but the chance of getting a 5 star is pathetic. Out of the countless gacha games I've played, this is arguably the worse one. You can tell they are just pushing out ""limited time gacha"" to force fans to spend on the game, it's just sad."
I dont have to explain
Excalibur !
A Really fun game that boils the Fate universe blood in you
"Gacha rates and drop rates are horrible but gameplay and story isnt that bad either so eh, play at your own risk"
"Once you get into the actual game, it starts to bug you constantly for money. The combat system is also extremely ""meh,"" as you tap cards of your characters with different types. The art style of your fighters also look like sheets of paper with moveable joints, just....not my thing... and I love the anime."
Sana nakuwa ko Na üò≠üò≠
You hit the pay wall pretty quick. Uninstalled after 1 week.
The money i spent is worth a luxry car
Gacha salt
"Why I rated this as 4* this time, you ask? Well, it's because of the loading times and abyssmal drop rate, my dears! Once I had rated this full 5 stars, but that I haven't considered the time I spend on waiting for it to load its initial download data (2 hours!) and those loading screens üò£ and I was born E-lucked so I guess I am a reroll god so that's so not fun üò§ But anyways that's the only thing I don't really like about this anything else is good like the story and the artwork is good..."
This game is so addicting...I'm F2P and start right on summer event..so happy to pull Nero caster and oda berserker in just 20 summons..plus get Ishtar rider NP5 for free..
"Tried playing this game many times now. Whenever I launch the game, white screen forever. I've tried all the solutions I could find online, but nothing has worked. I'm honestly shocked their development team hasn't fixed this issue."
The pictures on the play store for this game are a lie. Basically sit and watch bad animation fights and long cutscene's with no real depth. Not worth my time sorry.
"""Great"" Gacha Experience"
thus game is pretty entertaining. my only problem is the drop rate for ssr servants. they're too low.
A really great game to play for everyone
"Won't open anymore, crashes my home screen and asks me if I want to open Paypal, Gmail, Edge Browser."
Cash grab using the fate IP
"One of the few games that have me begging for more. The story is thrilling and in no way predictable! While the gameplay may get repetitive at times, you can really feel the impact of picking the wrong card or not using the right skills. It gives you a sense of control over the battle, which I believe is an amazing feat! Keep up the goodwork! :')"
Sometimes lucky and sometimes not
Don't roll the gacha
Too Cruel On F2P Players
It's super fun!
Best game and story I ever played in my life!!!
"I love this game, but this game runs very very slow on android. The loading screens take so long I don't feel like playing this game anymore. Pls fix"
It won't let me update.
All is good except for that you will really play hard to get enough saint quarts(if you're a F2P player).
what a memorable game
"This is a great game, and is fun when we get a new heroic spirit."
History am I right
It's just amazing
Do not play with game it's not worth your time unless your rich the spawns are badly unfair and the grind is way to hard the only way you'll get good stuff is by throwing a good 50$ or more just to get a sr I did not get a sr or SSR tell I bet the hole game it's a rip off and it's is just a sad tempt to milk you for your money like your a bank dont spend money on here go try a different game this is not worth it at all :(
"Clever servant names, neat servant designs."
things get repetitive after some time you do missions events and get rekt with rates
awsome
Great game but can u pls make another fate stay night game but like bleach brave soul it be really cool to play around in summon easy
I cant play this game after i download the game it always say that this game is not applicable to my gaming environment etc. Sad
"The game has a great story even though the early bit is a tad cliche. Additionally I see a lot of people complaining about the gacha rates, but none of them mention that there is a guaranteed paid 5 star 2x a year and they give away several 4 star servants a year along with hundreds of free quartz and tickets. Besides there are no story quests that require the paid servants in the game, friend servants are enough to carry you in the story and events. Upgrading is a grind though so be aware."
battery draining game. even when not being played.
"Not new player friendly, avoid this game."
"played so I would have something to talk about with my weeb friend, now I need more SQ for event banners."
Incredible game if you're willing to work hard. The hard work pays off.
"Trash rate, trash game, stay away if you don't want to go broke."
love grinding this is the game for you

"Takes too long to get to loading screen, THEN takes too long to load (freezes, loads a bit, freezes, loads a bit, and repeat EVERY TIME)! Want to like the game, but due to this, I hate it. üòí‚òπüò•"
I picked it up for the story and ability to collect the cool characters coming from other fate installments I had partook in. The gameplay is moderately enjoyable. The system for summoning servants is abysmal and the upgrades to them are similarly bad. If you intend to whale on a game you enjoy the story of then it's fine. If you would rather play reasonably priced or free games look elsewhere.
C o o l
I love FGO üòâüëåüíØ
garbage - no idea why some neckbeards like it - many other better rpg or gacha games out there
"The game is grindy like a lot of other Japanese games, but the plot snd characters make up for it. Gacha ofc"
"Thats hell your walking into - Emiya seriously if you have a gamble addiction or give in to tempation or are willing to sell your soul for a miniscule percent chance to get your specific waifu then turn back. if not, then download this game now because on gameplay stand point of view it very simple yet complex and story doesnt get amazing till Camelot singularity so dont expect much from earlier stories."
"As a Fate fan, it's really enjoyable and trust me, you can play this game for hours. My only complain is that sometimes the dialogue is messed up and people who complain about gacha rates shouldn't really. One could easily reroll and at the end of the day, we're dealing with percentages‚Äînot certainty."
"First off, let's talk about everybody's pet peeve. Yes, the drop rates are beyond horrible, but it's really not that bad. The combat is pretty much set around a paper/rock/scissor concept, so a 4 star  ""paper"" will do more damage to a ""rock"" than a 5 star ""rock"" and a lot more than a 5 star ""scissor"". So pretty much most of the characters can be used.  Furthermore, I've played many gacha games where you pay through your nose to get a powerful weapon, just to be junk in one month. Not in this game. All the servants are just as useful now as they were a year ago. And last, the welfare servant. Every month of two month they have these specials when you can acquire these 4 star servants that come basically with a maximum Noble Phantasm (their special attacks), and they are all very good servants.  My biggest issue with this game though, and reason I gave it 4 star, is the loading times. They are absolutely ATROCIOUS. Every screen change takes 5-6 seconds. Combat loading can take 30-40 seconds, in the least 20. Farming can get tedious, but other than these I really love this game. There's a lot of thought and work put in the stories and characters."
This game isn't free! The price is your soul as you fall slowly into madness. You will suffocate from all the salt you get from the Gacha. Only those who have fallen into the deepest abyss can warn those oblivious on what's at stake once you hit that download button. You think that you'll be able to finally get Altria Alter with all the SQ you saved up. But no...you'll just get Jing Ke and a bunch of eessence. All in all a great experince 10/10 would sell soul again.
took a lot of my memory
best mobile game out there
"I've been playing this game for awhile and have not once gotten bored doing so, it's a fun and interesting game with a great story. You may not get a 5 star for a long time but it's fun none the less"
"7/1/2018 This game was great and worked well for me when I first started using  it....a week AFTER it launched in the US since it was almost impossible to  download it when it first came out. However, I started having issues with  the game less than five months after I started playing it. They haven't  been fixed and this current update completely broke the game for me. The  tablet I play it on is fine for specs for playing the game and I was  usually playing it at home on my own Wi-fi. They really need to do  something to fix the issues it seems a lot of people are having. Update 8/12/2019 Well, I finally contacted the developer about the issues I was having with the game on my tablet, and it turned out that my tablet doesn't have the minimum required RAM to play it with all the updates, which is 2GB. They should mention this in the specs somewhere though, as the original specs that are required to download and play it were enough for me to play the game at first, but not over time. Kind of really a downer if you're looking to keep playing it on the same device you started playing it on. I still have to give them the information they require to transfer my account to a new device."
"Game is good though it does have a heavy emphasis on paying to win. Mechanics and animation are also getting updated to the ones in JP which is nice,however,it would be great if devs added a guaranteed SSR roll if you haven't gotten 1 in like a few rolls. At least this way,I don't feel like I actually have to fork out cash to even get a chance to compete in the harder levels."

"Cant access it on my phone, been trying for a few updates now and it still isnt fixed"
"welp, fantastic it is."
boring and lame. i like the anime but not this horrible game.
Downloading 6% in 5 minutes. No thanks.
Worst loading of any mobile game I've ever played. Unplayable if u want to go ftp. Prices are insane even for EA lvl microtransactions. Dont waste your time on this game.
game is good but it takes a long time to load the game and battles. also drains battery life. sadly with those issues thia game is not for me but it is good.
Game is great but crashes often
"Not for everyone, 10/10."
can't play
"Eh, I overreacted in my last review but I was worried I'd have to miss out on Chloe von einzbern, one of the best 4* servants. Fun game and the pull rates feel higher recently."
Gacha rates are so bad. It is just dumpster. Putting any money into this game thinking it will he enjoyment will just end up in disappointment. Unless you are ok with burning cash. This game is not for you.
"Fix your game. Literally unplayable since last update. Try to launch tge game and it doesnt launch the game, just tries to share it to email. Sad excuse for devs."
"good graphics and turnbase action, characters looks great also. good game...for whales that is. the gacha is just bad, wasted 90 crystals got no 4* or 5* servants. this game only good for whales unless you're a lucky f2p player"
"Lost all my progress and refused to help me recover any of it. said my account was ""too vauge"" to find. even though I had some of the most rare spawn drops, identifying name, and had logged many hours. I LOVED the game. I can't say enough about that. but having to start all over? when I was really strong.. it's like playing pokemon and getting through the first 3 gyms and forgetting to save and your game dies. no, I will not start over- you need to fix your player recovery."
pay to play game
it wont let me play it says it's not compatible with my device
boy
it okay
i cant launch the game keeps telling me to email my error code you shouldve had this compatible with most up to date phones and tablets
best game so much great thing I can't explain it
Overall great game. Only issue it takes forever to grind away and get gems to summon better heros. After a year long break because i lost my account the team was able to get my info back to me. Supper excited about this
"It's a fun game that has hooked me for 2 years. However, the customer support is terrible and I've constantly emailed then but to no avail. Not even a reply was sent to me to confirm they had received it or is looking into my case. So for such a great game, shame they've got one of the worst customer support."
Great game but can I get another transfer code for my account.. I switched phones bcuz my old phone broke but I forgot that the transfer codes only work once.. I only have my old transfer code to when I switched to my now broken phone.. pls help thank you
was excited to try it. but keep getting crashes when I open it with no explanation or found solution. will be happy to change review if it ever works.
good game!üëçüëç
came back after awhile to find everything wiped to square one. no way to get event exclusive ones again as events no longer exist. bye
"Ok game, but the rates for pulling anything halfway decent is so low. After roughly a couple thousand pulls, I have only received 1 5 star servant. Its supposedly a 1% chance, maybe I'm just unlucky, but this seems a bit off to me. The 5 star craft essence rate is 4% and I've pulled a fair amount of those, but more than likely the rate for a servant is a big lie and scam to get people to pay for more currency to keep rolling. Beware."
I have played this game for going on two years now and I think the game is great but would not recommend it to anyone the amount of money you have to pour into the game is ridiculous. even after putting a lot of money into it you are not guaranteed to even get something useful for the game when you do summons you literally eaither get the top servant you were trying to get or you will get trash that helps on no way just might cost you hundreds of dollars to get one servant that is good
Its decent except for the fact that when you go to collect your rewards for completing your daily or extra challenges some are uncollectable which means they just sit their while you click on it and it doesn't give it to you even though it says completed.
"""We only have so much money, but we have an infinite amount of love to give."" Grail your favorite waifu/husbando to 100"
I love fate grand order a lot but when will fate grand order arcade to come the USA so then I can play it and when will the vocies for all the characters be in english for both fate grand order and fate grand order arcade? Also keep up the amazing work and when will you guys do a crossover event with a diffrent anime or game?
too hard to get good characters
The NA team is possibly the most racist bigots in the industry. They cencored a black man and made him more white. Do not give them your money.
"Canon Fate/Type-Moon story by Nasu and others, but lots of exposition for newcomers and pretty f2p-friendly: every servant has a strategic use. After playing this game for 2 years with a few super-rares, I still turn to common rarity characters because of their strategic value. Just wished there wasn't so much to do!"
"I got my waifus, so I will rate 10/10 would gacha again!"
it's a little bit good but I like it it's too good I don't care if it's not good but the thing is I wish we would have had a dual then we would have I would have level up my team and I would have been stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger until I could beat everyone else and no one can beat me if I be stronger than y'all cuz you guys are well.? you need to be better than gas better than gas better than cats or better than cats well you're better tree cuz I'm at level 1000 no one can def
Don't want to play
"bad rates, encourages spending money to get more characters"
"it freezes after i completed 1 mission (my device is asus zenfone max pro m2), kinda frustrating cuz this game is pretty enjoyable"
"The game has an amazing story that is constantly being developed. The gameplay is fun, especially against boss enemies but while grinding it is very tedious. The gacha is honestly just luck, I myself have gotten nothing multiple times despite spending money(a frustration that makes me wanna pull my hair out). Though the opposite is also true. If you are a fan of the Fate series, I reccomend this game because it is honestly amazing and no salty review about the gacha should deter you from it."
Your game Is a peace of trash
"As the summer heat reaches its peak, with kids playing in the water, we the ones who's lives have been dedicated to this game slave away waiting to see if we could possibly pull saber fran. but, it was all a lie as your on your 7th multi you check the rates one last time, but then, you see it, the thing that you feared, you roll before it was just Fran on rate up. you cry ""it's not fair!"" but, young one, this game is not fair that is the life of those who play The cursed game, Fate/Grand Order"
"Love the story, the art, the voice acting, and the waifus, keep up the good work, I'm a dolphin"
had the game for a few years now just downloaded the new update and I lost my whole account and all of my saved data that I had!!!
Not available on Android Q. It will crash afte you press the icon
game refuses to launch.
saberrrrrrr!!!
"Trash game with no real gameplay and 10 minutes in this game would make you fall asleep. If you are not a hardcore fate fan, this isnt for you"
really fun enjoyed the story and extra content.
"If you can play JP, much better. EN version is behind content, not welcoming to new players and is just hard to catch up without incentives. i made JP account 2 weeks ago and got surpised with my progression through their giveaway EXP cards"
gacha is truly hell but it's fun. been f2p for a year and I have a ton of 5-4 stars u just need to be patient and be smart on who to roll for
The Fate franchise is just awesome. ‚ô•Ô∏è
gilles best servant
ahhhh
"I have to say that this game is prefect but My specs aren't suited to the game, the fps in my phone is low and I cant really enjoy it so please make this compatible for low end phones that's my only request :)"
The games story and characters are amazing. The issue is the gacha but its mad up for by the fact that even the lowest rarities can be used to do challenge quest. overall a little grind heavy but it is quite a bit of fun and a intersting story with some fun events
5 months now and they tell me that they foubd my account but cant verify its me how hard is it to litterally check which account it was that purchased things in your damn game. dont forget you account ID cause it doesnt matter how much info you know about your account they wont give it back unless you got that account ID.
game uninstalled itself and i lost all my progress
It is good but the updates usually takes forever and it glitches out sometimes
Another card game. :(
I love the fate series and I love this game
this is a fun game
"Worse than the Japanese version, the US version has censorship and significantly less giveaways than JP. Still better than Fire Emblem and many other mobile RPGs."
doesn't work
The longest game I played. Has the best story mobile game I ever played. trully a masterpiece.
"Story is fantastic. As far as gacha games go, this is probably the one I'd recommend to Fate fans and non fate fans alike."
i installed this game about 1 week i haven't downloaded the content yet cause it is downloading like a snail that have a cancer in the butt cant even dowload when i minimize it and now it wants me to update it and lose all i dowload? uninstalling takes only few second better take that route
"Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but the rates and cost of summoning is just absurd. Generously, I'd say it's 25 dollars per 30 saint quartz. You get 1 per first time completion on a quest. The rates are literally 1% per SSR and 3% per SR. The game could've been a better experience for me if it wasn't so pay to win. It seems many people would agree with this."
"Trust me, if you dont get merlin, this game is trash1"
i really liked the game however at one point when i switched to q new phone it was impossible for me to get my account back i know my account id but i never set a password if theirs a way to get the account back i would appreciate the help
"Damn it! i just downloaded it, then won't even open. Can't even see ""this app has force close"" something. Hate it"
"Nice and interesting story:‚òë LOADS of recognizable characters ‚òë Top tier waifu appeal ‚òë Constant time limited events that crank FOMO up to 11 ‚òë‚òë Super expensive in-game currency‚òë Impossible gacha odds ‚òë‚òë‚òë This is the poster-child for all exploitative micro transaction driven games. But I like it A LOT, and I still haven't spent a penny on it mostly because a 0.01% chance to get the SSRs I want costs $3 a pop and the game is actully relatively generous if you spend time with it"
"If only it loads faster for Android, I love this game but it forces me to stop playing since it loads too slow."
Yet another game that blocks you from playing because you're a developer and use your phone for work. The mobile eco system is a joke.
"Stay away. Posted rates are half of actual. They are actively screwing you out of your money. If you want to play an actual good gatcha game, check out Granblue Fantasy. One server, 99.999% in English. I'm out this B"
Great pass time with addicting gameplay
Game crashing at grand order chapter i cannot progress any further. I am using a One Plus 7 Pro.
Easy money üòé.
"As long as I have a good luck, this is a good game."
"Mostly good, load times are a little long and gameplay is a bit boring."
it wont let me open the app after installing it‚òπÔ∏è
"won't even attempt to open on note9, as soon as I click the icon a prompt forces me to open gmail and email the developer with a prefilled message saying the app won't work"
It's nice n all but the gacha mechanics is kinda ok... still it's a good game with very nice girls reason why I played this game is because of mah girl mhx
"*tears* This is a really good and legit turn-based tactics game, but it's buggy and freezes sometimes. When email support isn't helpful at all and you try reinstalling the game without issuing a data transfer number, you lose everything, so don't be a fool like me. *creates a pond of tears*"
"A disgrace to this franchise 1) bloated unskippable, flamboyant animations and inefficient data use make opening loot boxes take 5 minutes depending on connection loading times are painful bc animations and sprites are too high quality 2) character designs are atrocious anime tropes with names of historical and mythological figures slapped on them arbitrarily nero is a skinny swordfighting girl, and there are too many genderbends/hot girls because some otaku needs something to fap to. boring."
good game but to many updates
"The game is amazing and I am fascinated by the gameplay,the story and the servants.However,I would like NA to catch up with the JP version.I can't translate all that Japanese!"
"Welp for having played this game for little more than 2 weeks. i can say this game is quite fun, i find myself enjoying the story and the overall gameplay as well as the animations and detail put into all the characters. After playing so many gacha games that i have this game probobly has my wallet on a leash and i dont even know it, but so far it seems more free to play friendly compared to other gacha games so i may not even have to throw money at it."
"Gameplay is boring, and recycled into your Madoka Magica game. Story sections are extremely boring to trudge through. Graphics are bad."
"Good Game, Collect the Waifus! Being more serious the story is extremely amazing, the events are always fun (Cept that thing called farming. But thats more optional and up to you the player, you can enjoy the event and kts story with pretty minimal farming). Stick with it and it pays when you have higher servants. You have to work for making your servants better. you don't just get free handouts. ot make the quality of the game that much better! Plus those final arts for the servants, Oh baby!"
i hate this game and rateup is a lie.
brilliant game but can be repetitive sometimes
It is a decent game for mobile.... if you ignore the long load times. down right usless CEs researching for team lay outs for f2p plauers and pouring dozen of hours per charachter to make them work. hundreds if you are lucky enough to get 4 or 5 star charchaters story is hard to follow thanks to the textbeing almost all dialogue at times. the gacha is so predatory and bad that playing for 4 years and i only have 7 gold charchater. only one of them are a 5* yes you get hundreads of duplicates.
an absolutely stunning game it isn't dull and boring like the other kind of Gacha games because they keep us entertained with the idea of events and servants that keep pulling us back In and isn't as easy as well so you have to focus more
"Insanely repetitive with no method of automating the grind, the gacha system is what it is... The art style is super nice, though, and at least there's all the FATE characters you would want."
"It's a fun game, although like many other games. You need to either play for many months to get amazing characters or pay lots of cash. Whenever I restart my phone, I always get a app crash message. It's happened since day one and it's rather annoying"
I NEED MY WAIFUS
I don't play much so üòí
awsome game love the anime series
"The game is good but my main problem for now is loading time per fight, takes about 1-3 min. I don't mind the drop rates for a servant since this is a gacha game but farming materials for some reason on my account is harder than other players"
Yet to get anything and I'm satly
it was great to play a game that i really enjoy
Lost me account after the new update
it is fun
if you like it; you like it. this is a great addition to the fate-verse
awesome servents
The ultimate waifu collector... also the reason why im in massive debt. 5/5
not gonna lie I've never been this weeb in my entire life
this game really helped in expanding the nasuverse and my understanding of it
fun love the game
LOVE THIS GAME
my money evaporated
Amazing game.
This game is the best i love it
best fate game ever execept for the abyssal drop rates other than that best waifu collection game
best story and great gameplay for RPG fans.
it gud
"if you like having money, then stay away, this game is unlimited waifus works but you need to sell your soul first to win."
All you need is either astoundingly abysmal or frighteningly tremendous L U C K to have fun with the epitome of anime B U L L that is this game.
Overall a fantastic game! Only complaint is gacha is bad civilization
This game is very fun and has an engaging story. The Type-Moon franchise is certainly coming full swing in this addition to their great repertory of games and novels. Because it is F2P with optional purchases it may be hard to summon.
"great game to spend time on in 10 minute bursts, and very friendly to F2P."
Well structured. Good stoyline and events. Can be successful without spending anything but extra time. Very generous with free gems currency and opportunities to earn them.
"Great Game! Like literally, the singularities can get you hooked into the main storyline. Rate Up for SSRs in the SQ Gacha may be a lie, but overall, you'll encounter minimum amount of bugs and glitches. Solid title to the Fate Series! :D"
when there was a error in the game it said it can't find the game server so wait a couple of days and it uploaded and it deleted my game data. I'm through of play this game!!
Gacha hell is best(?)/worst(?) hell
"10/5 makes me want to spend money that I don't have. Thanks, game."
Gacha Ruined my life
Censorship is never okay. Very poor performance.
"if you want an enjoyable experience, dont play this game. the jp version is much better"
Fun time burner all helps satiate any cravings for FATE
exceptional
Fun turn-based RPG.
"Great gameplay and f2p mechanics, is very grindy at times though"
watched the show then my friends told me about this 2 years later still enjoy it.
GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHAAAAAAA
"For all fans of the series, the story is awesome and entirely feasible regardless of the rarity of Servants. Add to it the welfare 4‚òÜ Servants in events and the generous amount of free quartz, the odds are usually fair of scoring the one you seek."
great see
"Great game, no bugs, plenty of information."
"I originally gave it 3 stars but it looks like my rating has been deleted so have fun with a 1 star. I won't change what I said though. Despite having great gameplay with interesting characters, story and events it is marred by a myriad of things. - Worst summon rates of all gacha games. - Very low odds for materials forcing obscene farming to waste entire days - Worst gambling practices I've ever seen in a game costing the price of a AAA game for only 2 10-summons with 0.1% chance for 5 star."
yung ate ko i nagdadownload nito app so i downlaod pero hindi nadadiwnlaod
"You've heard of Gacha. You've heard of Fate. Combine those two? You get this monster of an application. Simplistic Gameplay, friendly to F2P. + Characters are lovable. Too lovable. Rip Wallets. + Story is well written (Especially good at wrenching your heart after the 5th Arc) + Simple for players to get into. Many Freebies. - Grindy. Very Grindy. - Materials can be hard to get without access to events. Join now for they have not implemented a clear requirement yet. Now's the best time."
gud
I'm a Fate fan so...
i gave this 5 stars because its the closest ill get to one in this game
"Farming quests still take 4-5 minutes to complete. Could use an auto battle mode for farming materials. Many other games have this feature, FGO behind the times. Also, the fastest quest battle speed is like normal to slow in other games. Also customer support seems to not be helpful beyond certain ""core"" phone models which makes it fairly annoying. Finally, the dev still does not understand what it means for a player to farm mats in their game as they sees everything in rose coloured glasses."
awesome game engaing story great battle system and best waifus
"This is the best gatcha game I have ever played. While there are rare, powerful units with miniscule drop rates, there is also a lot of good units at lower rarities and the game regularly hands out strong units for participation. The story campaign is long, with a lot of fun characters that come and go and occasionally show up again. There is a great deal of variety between story sections, and almost every month brings an optional campaign that is lighter in tone. Very good customer support too"
pretty good game and this helps me alot with a lot of fate series story..
"A very nice game for fate fans, but I wish developer will take pity and second guess about their decision to pile up more and more hp meter for bosses fight. it gets mind numbing too much at times. also, the alternative mystic code have unrealistic exp requirement."
dont try to grind past the first singularity after number F. you will regret it. other wise have fun. its grindy but it's also a phone game remember. it's not ment to be played like a normal installment in a franchise.
its a fun game inlove the story plot and game play i kinda wish it had better rate ups tho
"Gameplay is fun, the gatcha rates are pretty terrible though. Other gatcha games I play (take Azur Lane for example) I can get enough of the resources required to roll the gatcha to get pretty much all of the event exclusive characters in a week beforehand. grinding for those resources in FGO you get like a handful a week maybe enough to roll the gatcha twice."
A game that's beautiful
suprer fun
Best Gacha Game out there
Gimme 5 ‚ú©
This game is more addictive than meth. Also I strongly urge people ignore any reviews complaining about drop rates as they were all posted by people who don't understand how gacha games work.
Maybe just maybe i'll get a 5 star if i rate this game 5 star as well
"Really fun game, interesting story for the most part. Good-awesome character designs. I dislike how leveling the servants works but that's the system they chose. Only other beef is how slow you build up the currency to roll on the gacha, really pushes you to pay on the limited time events."
"Almost a year playing this, the main story is very rich, immersive and entertaining, every month you got an event or two, it is not boring, you have something to do with the game, and the enjoyment and fun is there."
Game is good. First 5 min of world building is slow. then it's all uphill.
great app i play it every day to summon servants and grind and cotcha and play the events. I even volunteered for the FGO experiance at the madman anime expo. only thing that would make it better is more free saint quarts
DCM 8 TH√ÅNG KH√îNG SSR
I like Fate!!!!
dolphin!
"Good game, the mechanics have surprising nuance to them despite the gameplay being straightforward. Yes, there is gacha, but the free servants are surprisingly strong. Don't slack off on the grind - this isn't a pay2win game."
My favorite series of all anime
great game wallet breaking gacha
Absolutely addicting.
I love the game and have been playing for a while now.
"Loved the game on the Japanese version, and love the official English translation for this version. It's always exciting and enjoyable to read through the in-game events or story. Definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the fate series or looking for a mobile game with nice Characters for everyone, and a interesting story (albiet slow start, picks up around 3rd-5th singularity depending on person)."
So far i absolutely love this game. The music the graphics both amazing
"love this drat game SO MUCH. gacha is satan's work, but OTHER THAN THAT!!"
I now have completed my fox girl waifu collection. üòâ Fun game though.
"A culmination of what I like in the Fate series, can't wait for the anime adaptation. Completely playable as a F2P player."
"i love the fame and the franchise, but many of the decisions they have made lately are questionable. no comunication with your player base is bad, specially when you are currently competing with other apps that do much better"
yeet your meat to the beat
BB-chan!!!
"I love this game. Good story, good narrative and there is actual depth in the game."
wish there was auto play option
you are wasting your time with any other mobage
Great gacha game if you enjoy the Fate series or anime in general.
"ive only been playing this game since yesterday and i love it, the only problem is load times, it takes 1-2 minutes per almost every loading screen, especially when its exiting battle area, othereise i have found this game amazing and beautiful"
Umu by the beach... you know who I want Aniplex
Good job bringing improvements from jp earlier. Please consider bringing back old events to newer players via prism shop but as a one time clear only
would be 5 if you guys listened to the fans and increased the rate of getting 5 star heroes.
A lot of waifus... lol
Not playable on vivo devices üò§üëå
"A GREAT GAME... FULL TEARS AND SALT, WELCOME TO GACHA HELL!!"
da bomb
interesting concept but poor execution. just a bunch of loading screens. uninstalling now after three stages.
all the character designs are hentai caliber nasty.
"I really like the game! what i don't like is that your data isn't saved if you uninstall the app. i changed my phone and unfortunately i lost all my servants. You only get to use the ""Transfer Number"" once (which i didn'tuse that time)...and that really sucks...i wish they would change this... like maybe having us create an account to save all our progress."
"one of the best. great story, not a competitive one. just do at ur own pace, hard missions, strategy is 10/10 ,1* servants can outshine 5*. and gacha is one hell of a luck. i bet even selling ur kidney wont help u to get ur desire servant if its not ur day. then sometimes u get 5* on a free ticket. using some technique, weird rituals or pray might help üòÇ. my only downside is the loading. too long. dunno if its on my phone"
four sabers
Save your saint quartz
its fate lol
Hands down one of the best mobile games. Been playing for 2 years now and loving every event.
fun as hell but the chacha is hell
the best game i have played so far
"add google play saving smh i already lost 3 accounts, still a great game doe üëç"
Takes too long to load.
Not getting past the downloading screen even though my internet is anazing. Play Fire Emblem Heroes instead.
best fgo gameee
its a fun game and has many iconic fate charactes and more. Its largly a pay to win gacha game BUT If your lucky enough and willing to put in some elbow grease you can make even the worst tier servants into hidden gems
"It's a fun game, but can you please fix this app? It is taking too much space from my phone."
too much downloading
"The game won't open up once downloaded, anyone else having this problem?"
"Too much ""loading"", could not take it."
read reviews thought it might be fun. been playing for 2 weeks. absolutely boring game. every battle is repetition. 9/10 the support character beats the opponents while the regular character just do nothing. I found myself at day 4 just logging in and getting daily reward. went through 100k in friend points with nothing to show for it. just plain boring.
It is fun.
cool games to play
"This app is no doubt a work of art, no stars üåü are able to determine its Rate,  ï‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢ î"
its almost like the anime except not as dark
a fun game to play If you like to grinding.
"Best Anime Game. For Fate Franchise fans, it is best to play this game. Love it. Excellent Graphics. Best Storyline. Love the events‚ù§"
Its awsome
like it!! If can have some sale for the saint quarts..
well I a FP2 so i have no problem in gacha
i really do love the anime all of the fates but my favorite one was fate stay night unlimmited blade works
"WORST GACHA GAME EVER. Been playing for a while, saving quartz and buying them, but what you get from summon it's always the trash."
"4 stars only because I'm wait ting to find out if master and servant are a item, if this has a five star then that means I found the master X servant."
"Honestly lacking in content, and mostly atrocious pull rates considering the amount of gems given. I did a 3 gem pull and got a 5*, but out of 2-ish 10xs, only seen duplicate craft essences...the HELP menus explain absolutely nothing in terms of multiple things."
"gameplay is 5/5, however the optimization on android is terrible. frequent crashes daily and slow loading times compared to iOS"
"This game is grind hell if you value strengthening your servants and getting as many materials from every event. Writing varies from hilarious to heart breaking and you will fall in love with the characters. Gacha rates are awful for characters, to anyone who discovers they have a problem with gambling like I did, don't start! The debt hole is large if you want them all. Despite all that, a game with no PVP, great dialogue, engaging story, and simple gameplay, I can't recommend it enough!"
SUBARASHI!!!!
"had to restore phone, lost data, all purchases. everything's gone. now I gotta sort through my charges to see what to dispute with my back. terrible company and game."
intro fight was boring with very little actual instructions to how the game functions and the introductory cutscenes thereafter took entirely too long without explaining much and I got bored and uninstalled the game before getting to actual gameplay
"Phenomenal. This is one of the most carefully crafted and lovingly made 'self-aware' F2P games I have ever seen. No, IT IS the best. Hands down. Emotion and patience, care and consideration has been put into this app. It is not predatory in anyway, being the only game I can recall putting a disclaimer in the loading screen about paying being optional. Plus, it respects the break screensaver, which I personally find respectful. Challenging and thoughtful gameplay. Humorous. Try it for a week."
gacha rates are trash
"Luv the game hands down . If you're a Fate fan, all the more reason for you to play the game . Luv this game"
i want to pee on nero
"The gameplay is fun and the story shifts from mediocre to pretty good depending on the chapters available. The only problem is, getting to play with the characters you like is locked behind an ambiguous pay wall (loot boxes). Big fans of Type Moon are the target audience, so i doubt there is much wide range appeal."
I can't run into my Sony Ericson. always comes out.hays.please help me
"Now, I've never seen the fate series in my life, but I got immersed in this game pretty quickly. The various servant classes, art work, and events are just a few things to look forward to."
so five stars on this game but the only nitpick I have is the story Summons and the fact that 10x summon in any of the Gachas is 30 Crystal it is a bit expensive it would have been nicer if it only cost 10 Crystal this would actually make others feel excited to roll and for those with money to actually spend some money on Crystal's but what would be even better is if in all pulls had a SSR to SR guaranteed drop after say 99 pulls like have a countdown or something. but Good game overall
I like the game and all but the only thing I dislike is the one-time use transfer code. I don't really understand the point of having a password for something you'll only be able to use once. It sucks I can't get my old character back but the game itself is decent.
Two of my friends got me addicted to this... then I got my boyfriend addicted. Worst thing about the game is how addictive it is. It is really fun! A little repetitive with gameplay but it updates things frequently and has great events.
i love the story of this game
The BEST and fun mobile RPG game ever.PERIODTTT
"very fun and an enjoyable story, even if getting those 5 star summons is a little tough."
"awesome app! its fun but the RATESSS. My only thing I'd like in the future updates is for it to be full screen on my longer phone, instead of having black bars."
dont want ani other game
Good game. I've spent way more than I should have. Too many good characters.
"rng sucks, been playing the game for 2 yrs, not even a 5 star servant on my stash"
HELU GUDMURNENG!
Very additional
"does work, opens for a second and crashes right away."
it look fun
Game so far is good. Suggest adding Pvp mode into the game
"I ended up losing my account with no forewarning. The team was really quick to respond with helping me recover it, even though I couldn't provide them all the information. I'm really glad that they could, because I do love this game."
"The drop rates may be bad sometimes, but you don't need high quality servants to play the game. Even 1 star servants are capable of clearing the story. This game needs you to have patience, skill, and a little bit of luck. So go enjoy playing this game"
Me: 120 quartz no ssr My friend: 1 summon ticket ssr Me: Surprised pikachu face
Please help! I cannot connect to the game server today! its a loop of fail connection! I cannot delete because i cant remember my user id!
"Something is wrong with your game. I have re-downloaded it many times now and it does not open. This has been happening for the past 3 months. I enjoy this game, it would be nice if it worked again."
quite a good series i watched
cool nice
great (mostly because I like fate)
I like the game because of the anime but when u play it (in my opinion) it gets boring
"great game. I got it a week ago and it worked fine, but I had been trying to download it for a month without it working. I have gotten back to my house and it's not working again. It says it has no connection to the server even when I am sitting right next to the wifi box, can you please try and fix this problem?"
it Gud
cant escape from CROSSING FATE
No I don't want to do the stupid tutorial every time i have to put this on a new phone or tablet.  Give me a method to skip it and login to my account on first start up.
"would rate higher but there's no way to link account, my phone messed up and when getting my new one I had to start over. lost my np lvl2 5 star Enkidu, my 4 star babylonian Gilgamesh, my 5 star mysterious heroine x alter... all in all I love this game, just upset that there's no way to get my stuff back. 3 months later and I finally have my first 5 star again. I would gladly rate this 5 star if I could get my units back."
"fun, .lots of farmimg"
its not what i thought it would be but its amazing i just wish it qas english dubbed not with all the japanese but i dont mind at all i love it but also i want some hispanic mayan or what ever type of south or central american tribes or ancient beings still good game
"Thanks for nothing. Why was I given a three star craft essence, something i'll never use in game, in place of the servant that was promised? And why is the game now taunting me about not getting them by refusing to give me the roulette currency?"
i give you 5 star so please give me more saint quartz
Boring even by gacha standards. The new art in particular is uninspired.
Never mind the negative reviews you are playing a gacha game so stop with the saltiness you should expect to yourself to not get whatever servant you want everytime. as an F2P player with only 3 ssrs I am enjoying the game for its gameplay and storyline. ^^ Keep up the good work Aniplex and DW
Doesn't want to open
liked this game at first but it takes too long in between battles and then i had to keep downloading an update
very overly laggy. do not spend money on quartz to summon new heroes brcause theres a high chance you wont even recieve a hero of any star quality.
"It's fun, a little unfair with the drop rate of most 4 and 5 star servants but still fun nonetheless."
sweet
The game mechanics are fun and I feel like the story belongs in the Type Moon universe which you don't get in alot of spin-off games. The protagonist could have used more personality but they are supposed to be a self insert in the story so it's understandable that the player choices are sometimes bland and don't affect the game in any meaningful way.
"Been playing since the original run of the JP version. Good stuff, 10/10. Bunyan is out!"
It's good but way to hard to gain saint quarts unless there free ones
"One of the few games worth playing on Android. The story is great. The mix of personalities and historical characters make this truly ""grand"" in scale."
great story and characters
Best games for memes. 10/5
"unable to launch with developer options enabled and usb debugging enabled, sucks when I develop android apps, dev options and usb options are needed to do it and this app won't open."
"Life cold, tiddy warm"
Rebecca Williams
the only game I've yet to get bored of enjoyable story and awsome charecters
"good game but the amount of time it takes you to do a x10 draw is crazy, then you do two back to back and best you get is a kid gilgamesh whose a three star only... how can you progress with with characters? Sucks when you need to rely on friends which only gives 25 pts instead of 200 for story support but they're too weak and I can even beat 2nd singularity without. plus you need the friend pts at start of game to summons and upgrade"
"Great gacha game for those who love the Fate series. Great art, and summonable servants. The gacha itself however is very unforgiving with poor odds."
luv it
"If you like the fate series you'll like this game, it has all your favorite heroic spirits and honestly alot of of really neat free ones"
"I enjoy this game a lot, kinda wish it wasn't so easy to get duplicate summons though and get new ones but other then that I'm enjoying the game as a whole"
time is fun and it cool to play
realy love the game
gacha has no mercy
Mordred pls come home ily edited: Mordred came home with 1 ticket im so fuccin happy üò©üíï‚ù§!!
"Great story, fun play style!"
my phone broke and since this game doesn't actually save to a profile you can log into but instead onto your phone you're screwed if you can't get the code to transfer... honestly how they can do this when you can pay real money is beyond me.
if your looking for a good story and rpg wrapped together then go for it!
"This game is fun! Yeah, the censorship and gachas are terrible, but the gameplay, story, and events are quite amazing. I've been playing since it released."
Top quality game. Will make you lose your money faster than your wife could.
"Loved the show and games to include this one, customer service was amazing and very helpful!"
It's a good game if you love fate series
I have always loved Fate. The only downside is the game is so slow to load and excessive amount of updates. Cool game and storylines though.
"Basically...It's not too bad if it wasn't near impossible to get units. Like this game seriously is looking to grab your money! You're better off playing a slot machine than trying your luck with this game's summon pool. That aside- The game looks nice, and they do allow you to have support units. If im honest though...after Singularity 4 if you haven't gotten at least a SSR and a few SR units then you may as well uninstall because you get locked progress wise. Rather disappointed with this one."
awesome game!
"while this game lacks a good auto mode for farming at higher levels, it combines an interesting story (mostly) with easy to understand mechanics and a diverse cast of characters. the artwork is often disappointing, especially for female characters, but the game is otherwise fun and has good progression for f2p players if you put in a little bit of time. frequent events and drops make it possible to get a good number of summons without paying."
"üíñ 1-3 star servants is good civillization, dont let the number of stars fool you. its a fun gacha game. after all, if we could easily get sr and ssrs then we wouldnt feel the happiness and eagerness we'd feel when getting them!!"
tamabea
Greatest Game of My Life.
edit: i even spent money on this game and still summoned nothing üò´ Drop rates are terrible and makes it hard to invest even more time into the game especially compared to similar titles. Gives barely any quartz and makes it feel like if i want a character im going to have to invest real money and just pray. That being said the characters are cute and the game can be fun but its hard to feel like it's worth all the time investment.
awsome to the max
very great game. but depends on your luck
"only problem i had is the game says""poor connection"" and have to restart(thebn freezes if i tap one button) , how can I fix that? over all its all very, very good!"
huge fate fan
1 tix = waver :>
love everything about this game! not only the graphics are superb but the gameplay also requires you to take it seriously!
Tldr game is fun.
I like the fate series a lot and the story is really good but I mostly just dont okay attention in my history class so I watch/play Fate.
great story good characters amazing arts and talented seiyuu's theres just one thing that i dont want .... THE GACHA üî•üî•üî•
"Ive spent too much money, and the game is very easily played for free..."
its okay
i woyld have gave 5 star cuase it honestly deserve it if not for the fact that the devs is so bias to iphone users when it comes to loading times
Release me from this gacha hell
good game :)
"great game,fun to play at any free time during the day."
"Love the lore, characters and weslth of content and localization quslity... but I DESPISE the BS gacha rates."
gacha hell but it's my hell
"God awful drop rate, but story is a great, and waifu so 8/10"
haha waifus
300 saint quart 60 ticket the star above is what i get.
The game forcing me out and I can't even get my save data back what the f***
Gacha is Bad Civilization.
waifu/husband gambling
fun if you like visual novel type games but the core gameplay is verry bland and repetative
great game. too bad the summon rate sucks.
the most hellish gacha!!!!!!
one of the best game's i've ever played
adicted
Luv this game! Waifus here I come!
A very nice and F2P friendly game with lots of colorful characters.
Fun with thicc anime girls
an amazing game
love playing this my only complaint is paying to get saints quartz but you can obtain free ones in game so it's a minor complaint
Very good game... nice story board...
"A fun, if somewhat frustrating, game"
"very fun, great characters, intuitive and strategic combat. draw rates could be a little friendlier but, on the bright side the game can be cleared with low rarity and some of the free servants given out."
give me martha
have fun with gacha luck
"gacha = bad civ, story = good civ."
"love it, great turn based fighting with amazing looking characters."
Git Gud
fun game
good waifus
This game is great and the best freemium game that i ever play. But you need to know anything about fate franchise before play this game.
"Gameplay is simple, with just enough nuance to let you plan out rewarding sets of actions on a turn by turn basis. Power creep exists, but is much slower than most games, with future units doing mostly variations on existing skill combos. I do want to stress that while you can clear all content so far with lower rarity servants, there are clearly stronger servants that exist to bait your wallet. Just know you have a .7% chance of getting your desired 5 star unit."
"Excellent game, famous voice actors and amazing graphics and ost. It doesn't feel like a mobile game with the heavy story and that's what makes it excellent. One thing that is bad is the gacha system, very low drop rate, only 0.7% chance of getting what is currently in rate up banner. Wish it gets higher, and give more saint quartz please. But overall the gacha system requires luck, some only get the 5 star once a year, need to have A+ luck. Can clear with 3 star characters though."
great waifu game
"5/5, would blow an entire paycheck looking for that special SSR that I need."
Eresh best girl
I love anime üòä
"This game is a 100% waste of time. Lost everyone after replacing my phone since there is ZERO way to keep your data on Google play l ok let's 99% of other games. Even trying to get aside that, the absolutely mind numbing FORCED tutorial makes it impossible to get back into the game. This game only takes away from you with giving you nothing in return. All of your hard work is completely vanished."
i can't registered my date to even pass the screen wdf lol
best game i ever played
game wont even open. keeps crashing
"Closes without even opening. I tap the icon, the screen goes black for about a second and goes to the home screen and then nothing. That's it. Perfect üëêüëåüëç"
love the gameplay and visuals.
RAIKOU NUMBA WAN
"inb4 gr8 b8 banner m8 So, there are caveats like connection issues or whatever lags with stages that has too many FXes innit. However the Story seems to be appealing to original VN readers, people who's into this kind of story, or even people who have no idea what they're going to play. I'm kind of surprised that voice actors like Maaya Sakamoto can pull voices for different characters. Gameplay is depending on your approach, i'm just an adaptive type lol."
hey i have been logging every day for some time now and only got the weekly bonus and not the expo event bonus. whats going on?
This game has broughten me joy and Insperation It is My favorite game by far its fun as hell and The Characters and voice acters are awsome as is and id say my favorite is Emiya but the game its self Truely brought me Insperation music beautiful sure its simple combat and gacha game and grindy but it is fun as hell for me I will always play this
Gacha Hell :)))
"this is a fun game full a great story, characters, and fun times with friends (if you have any because you are playing fate) the fact that you spend money to get the right servant shows how much you love the game and you really will love this game."
Really fun!!!
This game is slow to progress and the combat is very dry. You will not enjoy it unless you're a fate fan
this game is total BS I lost my account and all the time I spent in it when I changed devices
"no np skip , trash rates for a supposedly ""single player"" game , boring dialogue , garbage animation , gtfo out of my ads , nice no auto battle btw i heard u guys like to do yr dailies for 1000 times a day"
terrible game play no proper save just over trash makes the rest if the fate games seem good compared to this one game also gets super boring after you beat the story they never add new story line or anything never add holy wars its lame and coupd be better but no effort on design team no real save and if your phone breacks while your top rsnk you lose everything trash game trash controls
great game love it
five stars because the one star reviews kept me entertained.
do to ask xr good the last one she did for me to use ferry sum setup the j co don't cry in front of me. edgkncml can figure something Awesome.
Waifu simulator. No pressure to spend as there is no pvp. F2P friendly. Enjoyment depends on whether you can get the waifu of your choice. Reroll is recommended. Excellent story writing from camelot onwards! The newer servant have excellent animation too!
"why the frick would you change a SERVANT'S original skin color? jesus christ that's so stupid, even if it is about the racial thing it's sti stupid, its a goddamn game goddamnit."
"simply amazing, this game is good just level your servants if its getting hard and get some good help from those support servants"
"I actually enjoyed playing the game for a while. However, after spending over 200,000 friend and quartz summons without getting a single 4*+ servant (every guaranteed 4* ended up being something other than a servant), I decided that enough is enough, so I gave up and uninstalled the game."
cant play it on my s galaxy damm
"Story 8/10, Graphic 7/10, Soundtrack 8/10 The game itself was very enjoyable You can learn something from this game I'm sure of it. There a lot of memorable moments in the game. Sounds~ Narration~ Characters~ Perspective~ ‚Äî Good point - It's ""Fate""! Bad point - Drop rate in the game are pretty low and it very annoying! *Pro advice: stay positive and don't give up also manage your time well* Try it yourself! You will know if it worth your time or not. overall score 8/10 (Inner me 9/10)"
drop rates too low. I couldn't get a good char the 4 times I tried playing. gacha system is broke af
it keep said i am out of space when i delete all my games
Terrible drop rates and P2W
Too hard to get a 5 star üòê
got sherlock Holmes
"Great story, engaging gameplay, but very frugal summon rates. If you're a Fate fan you'll love this game. Only complaints are the harsh summon rates make difficult missions seem less rewarding and certain banners are only available for paying players."
"Words alone won't express how amazing this game is, all I can say right now is this game is worth every cent you'll put in it. #ILOVETHISGAME"
"Been playing this game since its launch and it has now reached its 2nd anniversary. No matter how good other mobile games may be, I will always end up just playing FGO. It may not be the greatest mobile game out there and it does lack content than some RPG I admit but the simplicity, the characters and the story behind it was what made me keep playing it."
just try it you got nothing to lose
Your game is great! im giving you 5 ratings as a catalyst to summon sherlock in my alt acc hehehe
I like the game but it's way to hard to get saints quartz near the end of the game... IT SUCKS
the game is good but with out no way to link account to fb and google play. its not worth olaying god firvid you forget your user name and link oassword thing they can't help you
10/10 waifu fest
best RPG ever
for the story and and battles it great.
"The game is certainly fun and the story is written well and has its funny moments but i wish the gacha was more forgiving towards players whether you are playing for free or you're willing to spend. I've been able to get what i want, but i wish i could happen more often than not."
Best gacha hell :3
I find it ridiculous that I can't have dev mode and debugging mode active on my phone in order to play this game.
i enjoyed playing this game but for some reason whenever I log in now just to completely block screen cups I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but just stays.
doesnt give currency.
looks fun but it doesn't even load on my s7
love the game and the waifus
freezes during tutorial
Booghett said it was good
"Load times are ATROCIOUS. This Halloween garbage is, bar none, the worst event I have ever had the misfortune to take part in in any game I have ever played. Apart from just generally being a pain in the ass, it is MASSIVELY exclusionary to anyone who hasn't been playing the game for a year to have such a ridiculous variety of servants leveled high enough to survive in these asinine restricted missions."
Love the Fate series and Grand Order does it justice and then some. One of the best stories I've seen for a mobile game
It's pretty neat :|
Its Fun.
Love the heroes
Its without a doubt the best mobile game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Too bad my luck is horrible.
"Tough Gatch rates but consistent, quality content."
Spend 2-5hours daily on it. No regret.
"Never updates to fit our screens. Fun game, but quickly repetitive. No customization. More reading than anything else, which would be cool, but the writing leaves much to be desired. Sony can do better. All of this makes the IAP all the more outrageous. People spend thousands, gambling on the rolls. That's all these apps are. A casino. Cool music though! Makes me want to stay in the app."
"every time i open the game it instantly goes to chrome and fills like- 500 pages, when i go back to the game, it opens another few hundred."
"The first Gacha Game I've ever willingly sunk time into. Progression speed may be linked to higher rarity servants, though you are very much capable of taking a lower star team through all the content. The only thing limiting your ability to go through the story is how much time you devote to leveling your team, and even that isn't too hard if you have the proper support and team line up. Create a team of your favorite servants and combat threats throughout history to save humanity's future."
i hate my friend's luck who is also an f2p but somehow gets ssrs in rows
play this game if you are in love with the series
thanks ufvn
"Honestly hope this game gets hit by the loot box banning bill that's coming soon. Wow, the only time you put in an actual ""guaranteed"" summon, we have to pay loads for it since we aren't allowed to use the free quartz. Just wow."
Redo The Saveing Account Stuff. i have hard time keeping my account
well the story line is good gatcha is really bad hard to get 5 stars plus theirs a crashing bug at agartha
this 5 star summon looking mighty fine
I need the np animation skip button. (seriously it would be nice)
Eww
"A game that is worthy of your time. I have been playing for almost 200 days now and I am planning to continue to do so. Good story and OST , Loveable characters and a fun experience overall. Just try to be patient with the gacha."
all good but summoning rate is trash
I like the game it's nice n all but I feel like rate up is a lie. i also feel that buying quartz increases my chances of getting 5 stars. every time I've dropped 20 bucks I've gotten. a 5 star. Not sure if it's just coincidence 4 times but it seems suspect to me man.
i put in the code for my data to get my account back it worked succesfuly but when i logged back on it deleted my data please help
"I love this game so much! But the only problem is that you don't get 5 stars often... Can you make it a little bit easier to get saint quarts? Also, I'm the daughter who is playing this game, so just to let you know. But the gameplay, controls, AND the graphics are very good!"
its not working on my pocophone.
They lost my account
"Is a great game but is has a very bad way to recover your account, I lost mine just because my phone broke and I couldn't maje a password so I lost all my progress"
There is way to much reading involved with this game. It took close to an hour to get through the intro and 5 battles. There is so much reading that when there are cutscenes you will skip every single one which takes away so much from the game. Unless you are a fan of episodic novels you should seriously consider playing another game.
another great fate game
"Helps me sleep, rough gatcha."
"I enjoy the time playing this game, but the loading is killing the flow"
I get a can't install error. I have a Samsung Galaxy s8.
Way too grinding. Kills the fun after a while
the game is so bad it won't even load up instead it force closes I've played my fair share of bad games but at least the other games actually boot up come guys really???
i just downloaded the game and it wont start it takes me straight to my homescreen on my phone
crashes repeatedly on startup. can't play
Doesn't start.
I will find you Delight Works and I will kill you for your demonic gacha.
it is a very good game the graphics are great but i only have one problem and thats being able to summon because if you have zero it will take well over a week to get about half of the number you need and i just got sick of grinding and grinding then only getting 1 crystal to summon other than that it is a phenomenal game and i highly recommend it if you love fate but free to play players are basicly screwed on obtaining gems so if you are free to play like i was good luck.
"when trying to first open the game, it forces open an email client"
gave me salt
The rates are terrible you only get one saint quartz for completing missions when you should at least get maybe 3 or 5 for doing missions overall this game could be better and should reward players more who spent time and effort and this game and please increase the drop rates for 5 star characters  and give use more saint quartz for completing missions
"Installing this game, i was a huge fan of fate/series and was expecting it to run on my samsung galaxy s6. When running the game, an email pops up saying that the game is not playable. Is it not playable on samsung devices? edit: after leveling to 50 and summoning so many times, i got zero 5 stars. dont play this game if you cant invest money, anti f2p game lul"
welcome to gacha hell
"horrible load times, unplayable"
"A fun game that I spent lots of time with. It gets one star because the most recent update wiped my progress, and expects me to start from the very beginning. Very glad I didn't put money into this."
"This is a good gatcha game but,I can't not playing this game in IDN region. üòíüòíüòí"
love this game!
none
i dont know what happend but suddenly i cant play my account anymore. this sucks ive been playing this for 2 years and just now i cannot play everytime i uninstall or clear cache it doesnt work . now when it works it doesnt load my account
"its not a bad game. events are good, f2p and welfare servants are more than enough to win with, and the grind isnt bad as long as you do the events. dont spend money unless you have it to spare, rates can be soul crushing. story only gets better, and characters are fun. gamepress has a great site for tips and tier lists, check it out"
I like this game but I've spent so much money on the summons that left me disappointed every summon. I'm tired of not getting any good 4-5 stars servants.....just sick and tired of it...
"it is the best gacha game eventhough the rates are very low. But still, the game is very enjoyable due to the story and as well as the character (servants)"
Rate up is a lie. Ok but but like my natural Luck thrives in this game.
amazing story line and characters
"Game is really fun, but I wish that you were able to get the item required to roll for more characters more often."
The game is enjoyable! The gacha needs improvement! Give equal chances of the draws instead of the higher servants at less than 1% chance. Make North America get equal content like Japan.
I love that game but it is really fun but I'm a really good at playing Sion you nearly been me every single video with mouth Zoom
its hell and I love it
Would love the game alot more if it had Data Link
Can't Open using Huawei phone
5th time review got deleted. is this legal?
its fun
Yee its gud
"This is the only gacha style game I've been able stick with and enjoy for an extended period of time. The story is fantastic once you get a few chapters in. The characters are great. They really put in a lot of work to make each servant into a full blown character, rather than just a collection of stereotypes that only have one facet to their personality. The gameplay is decently fun. Nothing mindblowing but stays fun as things get more challenging. Play for the story, it's also F2P friendly."
it's an extremely awesome game so many waifus
I hope rating this game 5 stars will give me better luck in the gacha
Rate up Sucks
it's better than fire emblem heroes
a good game UwU
overall it was a great game
"I dont know why why it keeps trying to launch PayPal to send them a donation, this is fkd"
very nice game. very enjoyable
pls Give me good gacha luck!!!
cant even play
Gacha ahahq
I lost my account and got it back. Beautiful and quick customer service.
Ruined by energy
Great Game But the Gacha really Shatters thy Soul and breaks thee heart
Love it.too addictive..
"6 ng√†y - 2 ssr + 3 sr, c·∫£m ∆°n fate stay night ƒë√£ ƒë∆∞a t√¥i t·ªõi ƒë√¢y üòö"
Freemium with a boring story
just prepare for salt gacha~
because i only got 4 star
"""Can't read or see anything on the ""News"" and ""Summon info"" windows ever since I upgraded my device to S10+..."" (update)Issue FIX: toggle fullscreen mode for big phones like S10+"
As a fan of the Fate Franchise i love this game not only dose it have some classic RPG elements but it also has a fantastic story and the number waifus in the game are endless.
"I spend more time on this game then I should, I love the fate series as a whole so why wouldn't I enjoy this game. it's very slow In the beginning but it picks up after the tutorial. this game is awesome just get It already!!!"
love the gameplay and storyline. the drop rates are pure garbage for both characters and items though.
niceeeee
App doesn't work.
"If you're a fan of hero collecters, and the fate series, you'll enjoy this game. The card combat system is unique enough to make this genuinely different from most other hero collectors, and the well written story makes this an easy game to play through. Much like in other hero collectors, be prepared for a serious grind for materials and the cash currencies you can gain from playing through levels."
fun to play! actually feels rewarding being able to do 10x summons
"Played the game for the story, but gacha rates are abysmal."
great servants and story.......enough said
Amazing story especially if you love anime and the fate franchise
Still good to play even if the game style itself is a bit outdated. The characters are what get you hooked. Frustrating gacha though.
Addictive games
fun game üòÅ
awesome game
god like
"An exceedingly boring game, the battles are slow and animations swiftly become repetitive, added on to the extremely slow grind to get saint quartz (the premium currency used for the gacha, which hardly ever gives you anything even half-way decent anyways), and you get this pathetic excuse of a game that is an insult to a great series."
"error 43, even tho usb debugging is off it still forces close"
best game ive played
An addiciting japanese game blessed with English translation...
The Gacha salt is real.
Why on earth is this app so huge? The download size is way too large for what it's worth. Can it be optimized or something
"Awesome game just wished it was able to connect with Google play, I had the game before and lost all my progress because I lost my phone and had to buy a new one and my old phone had my code to get everything back in it and I had to start all over again from the beginning after almost 2 years of playing but beside that is truly and awesome game I am a huge fan of the fate series and was very pleased when I found this game keep up the good work."
I personlly enjoy the game andfate series.
Game ruined my life. 10/10
So many waifus no sq
enjoy the fate cranchise then you will enjoy this game
"I have played for 2 years, this game has one of the best stories around. Do be warned this game is one of the rare type that doesnt use power creep to make you want to buy into the gatcha. They simply make you like the character."
Hey lets have a 15% 5 star Drop rate so this game wont end up in the trash
"I love the game, the story but i hate how cheap and greedy the developers are, it's near impossible to get good units even with paying FGO is a nightmare of a gatcha look at brave frontier or Crash Fever they're high grossing but give decent summon rates in their games but the devs of Fate/ probably wouldn't care"
I love it since I am a huge fan of tye Fate Series
"Aside from the low rates it has been my favorite gacha game, it requieres plenty of time tho, constant grinding and dedication. Love it :)"
"Awesome Game. Truly an Epic F2p game; dont get me wrong you CAN buy items, but this is a true fair game. Awesome visuals 5Stars Type Moon!"
I AM THE BONE OF MY SWORD
"fun gacha game that you don't have to spend money on. been playing this game since the beginning, even the Japanese version, have not spent $1 on it. got all the characters I wanted, though you will have to grind non stop. Still fun, and u can put down and come back."
"fun, well-run, and very generous with the free stuff."
good game. im hook in it.
It's freaking fun and I've grown quite fond of it.
just improve the gacha rate
The RATE UP is not a LIE!
rate up is a LIE
my favourite gacha. spare me my wallet
Love it !! Originaly I am a fan of Fate series since I was a kid and totaly adicted to it .. well some say the gameplay is odd but for me This game rocks... maybe add more interactions in servants you've pact or summon especially Mash.... and please kinda rate up some servants in gatcha...
"Need help. Really love the game since release but phone crashed and can no longer turn it on. I am afraid to do a factory reset and lose important data. I'm using a new phone now and installed the game but I can not retrieve the old game. I can tell you my username, the servants that I have and levels for some of them if you need proof. I can also tell you when was the last time I was logged in. Need help. This is urgent. Thank you"
awsome game
The best anime game app ever ... i found it out on the anine called fate/apocrypha
Best waifu is here
Been playing this game for 2 years now and as a Fate fan I have not been disappointed.
"I completely lost my original acct & had to start over from the beginning.. 361 consecutive logins & completed final singularity, gone. It would be nice to be able to restore accts or have it connected to FB, so you can retrieve it if something happens. But I love the game so I've started over"
I love the Fate series so naturally I enjoy Grand Order. Naturally there's something's that I'm not a fan of such as the servants and CE's being on the same banner but I've learned to cope. All in all its a fun if grindy game.
rate up huh but pretty decent game
its a better then average gagacha game
it keeps crashing and keeping me off the app didn't even get to play it
Very cool characters!
"The actual gameplay is pretty shallow and the game is grindy as hell. The story eventually gets good, but that takes an embarrassing long time. Only recommended if you are a Fate fan,you like reading visual novels and can tolerate boring turn base combat."
"lost my profile because it was just a the black connecting screen for a week with a message to clear cache. I did multiple times never worked, then it said to unistall, so i did. when i got back on all my stuff is gone all of it now I cant get my profile back nice job. Mind you I never switched devices it was all on the same device"
"It's a good game, but I hope that the support team takes more notice about the complaints and assistance regarding on the recovery of lost accounts and forgotten accounts, because I had it hard recovering my old account."
"Having famous Historical, Non-Fictional Mythical and Legends people and characters join you in your quest of stopping humanity's extinction!!"
"This is okay, wish the gacha was a bit more forgiving"
"Rolled penth with only 70 sq, Thanks dw very cool"
LUV IT
"Been playing for 2 years since its launch and I have to admit, this is the only mobile game I have stuck to playing for such a long period. The story is quite good, which has a good balance of seriousness and silliness. The graphics are great, with each servants having distinct designs and lore behind them which one can view in their respective profiles. Although it's a gacha game known for it's horrible rates, the game's contents can be cleared by low star characters."
"I was able to play this game initially on release now i can't even play it 
and it continuously sends me to gmail and tries to send a report over and 
over again i would like to play this game again"
all these people complaining about the gacha smh
"It's a game that I can actively enjoy with other people without having to get competitive. The gameplay can sometimes be repetitive, but that's why you implement animation updates, which is nice. The support team was very helpful as well, helping me recover an account I lost within a week. Overall, good game, good team, good community."
"The game doesn't need you to have that much 5 Stars. With the proper grailing of good 3 stars is enough, but if your lucky atleast have some good SSRs. The game also gives free 4 stars, some are meh while some are good. Its F2P friendly if you're a grinder and all just don't forget luck lol. Overall, it's a fun game! :)"
"great characters, good stoy, not a great gatcha, but it is a good game"
like the game alot
Happy 2nd Anniversary
üëç gotta love them gatchas
"The gameplay, story, art, sound, voice acting, and community? All great! The Draw Rates (5 star Servants are a 0.007%) and Difficulty Curve (Good Luck in Chapter 6 onward)? Terrible. Still would suggest it."
2 years delay and no plans on catching up?
"Waifus and a good story, what else could you want."
incredibly slow loading times pn android make this unplayable.
SSR MEDUSA WHEN DW???
I love everything about this the story the servents it's awesome but I do have one problem with it when I play this game half of it go's blank on the screen and it does ot every time I jogin I was thinking of deleting it and reinstolling it and it may fix it I don't know but I would like to play it more than ten minutes.
"The game is great ! Has really good graphics and animation for a tactic rpg game, intense gacha and very immerse storyline great development devs i wish to see more adventures in the future :3"
I enjoyed the animes but not the game. Not very well done and lavks any real imaginative ideas. I was hoping it would have been better but sadly it lacks in too many areas.
Its a really good game and series
lame
SO MANY WAIFUS
i would give it a 5 but no i'm dissapointed its getting very hard to get things to level up im stuck now and can't do a thing but di the daily battles i'm disappointed i was really starting to love the game so much now i am mad at the creators i want help!!
easy to play and fun with nice grapics
damn those low luck sucker blame the game. Sill funny to read tho
good story and amazing character's
bad gameplay and p2w
SUGOIIII pls gib saint quartz
"fun game horrible drop rate, and a battery killer."
Played for 1 year. I LOVE THE characters. Loved the game at first. But it went downhill when you realize that only whales and super lucky players will win in gacha. Then the game mechanic would strike you from being bearable to super boring. Dont waste your money on pixels. This should be classifed as a waifu simulator not a RPG.
yeh üòè
uh no no
good story and gacha is bad civi
"Gameplay is good and does require some strategy in building your team and using their attacks etc. Fans of the Fate series will love this game and the NA translators do a great job in translating and adapting the scripts to a more ""localized"" concept. Even though this is a game with gacha features to get characters, it's possible for f2p players to get good characters by earning the gems through weekly missions, completing maps and participating in events. The game does need some improvements on some basic interface aspects. It needs to allow player to access GAME OPTIONS (e.g. sound settings) at any time instead of forcing the player to advance in the tutorial before anything else can be done. Downloading of game data to speed up load times takes forever to download and if the screen times out during the download, the download apparently pauses, which means your screen must be left on in order to complete the lengthy download, which is dumb."
"Okay, so there is a lot of people talking about this game and a lot of information is either wrong or skewed. 1) The censorship isn't as bad as people are saying it it. All they did was make a character who had hideously charcoal colored skin into tan. 2) The gacha rates are low, but this is compensated by the fact that there are no useless characters. 1-3* characters are usable for the entire game, plus there are no penalties for rerolling your account to get the best 4* from the tutorial."
"Gacha Is Temporary, Salt is Eternal"
love the fate series
Best Waifu Gacha
gibe me ssr lol
Disappointing game. Too much of a grind with terrible pull rates on banners.
Really good:)
My life depends on this game.
game sucks the life blood out of my wallet very efficiently. id rate it a 5 but sadly that place is for gbf which is more generous with freebies.
Fun and simple game with a very interesting story. Gacha rates are terrible and this NA version is 2 years behind compared to Japan. You can still complete events with low-rarity characters but if you're hoping to get certain 5-star characters... goodluck.
"Game loaded up once, and now it just stays a black screen"
"abysmal drop rates for any servant. even low tier, save your money and dont spend it on this game. If you want a free play through and a new visit through the fate series its decent and worthwhile, but as you get deeper into the storyline you'll find it difficult to progress due to horrendous drops for any servants worth your time. dont give these people your money until they fix the drop %s and actually provide to their clients."
This is the one of the best Fate experiences available.
that gacha though ;(
"Failed Support Team. My account was transferred without me knowing because someone exploited the Account Recovery and now I'm claiming it back,but they failed to verify that I'm the owner. Disappointed. The game is good but the account bind system and the Support team are pathetic."
"This game is amazing. The majority of people that post a 3 star or below are just salty that it isnt like other games they've played. Localization is never an issue in my mind, Japanese game developers usually release their games later in the West, so it makes total sense that we're two years behind them. It's not to say that it's fair, definitely not the case, but it's a game definitely worth your time playing.. This game is an interactive story waiting to be unraveled. Also, waifus."
I hate myself
The gacha is painfully hard to get anything worth pulling and requires serious investment. The plot is good but also drawn out significantly by monotonous battles that should take significantly less time to get through. The only time you're really rewarded with paid currency is if their staff/maintenance team makes errors which they do fairly often. Gameplay - 4/5 Gacha - 1/5 Plot - 3/5 Staff - 1/5 Events - 2/5
"the only thing i have a problem with is the summons,it makes it to where its nearly impossible to get a good character even when theres rate ups,and i know it sounds like im nagging,but not everyone can pay saint qaurtz when they run out of them,so all im saying is that you change the summons to where its more likely to get a good character"
wont play on my phone
love it!
I can't gain access to my profile anymore or my game so I don't know if there's something that I have to go on to look it up but I would love to know
I downloaded this game for one reason and one reason only. To write this comment about Minamoto no Raikou. Her art in ads is SO RIDICULOUS it guarantees I'll never play this game. I dunno who drew her but breasts don't go that low bud üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. 1/10 if the art is bad the game is guaranteed to be bad.
Amazing game I love it so much trying to get your own characters and the story is a fun experience though the battles get a little repetitive overall you should get it since you never need to spend a cent unless you need the best of the best though i have 2 and put in 0 dollars so it is not necessary whatsoever. edit: on two hundredth day in January got my last servant was a repeat of maria Antoinette so useless for me and haven't seen one again and i do all events to max rip my luck.
the character are the best
You're going to feel either anger or joy. Try it out.
"It's a good game, but the only gripes I have with it are the drop rates and the prices for the premium currency. Other than those, it's good. One thing that I will give credit for is that the lower tier servants are not useless, in fact, one of the best support servants is a two star."
Great game with great customer services
game won't launch - generates an error report to email the devs on launch. Galaxy S9 Android 9
im a fan boiiii
doesnt give out 5 star characters dont expect nothing over a 3 star character from summons. Very disappointing
This game is more story and less GAME. i feel like im reading a movie. but its a good movie.... i just really really really hate reading. the graphics are beautifull but i feel like im being slammed with it like its hard to tell if its a game at all. the tutorials a bit long and i just want to skip the conversations but i don't out of respect for the developer and my own curiosity for what they have to say. the words of the characters seem forced just not for me i guess? its a japan style yakno
addictive
gacha salt feels good
"The story is great, great waifu material, with that aside, this game has pretty good content with events coming out almost instantly to fill in content"
for those who rate this game to 2 star and below are just salty because they didn't get any SSR servants. see it for yourself.
a good game but the game is kind of laggy especially when loading i doubt its my connection
10/10 best gacha game drop rate is good
"This game, By Far Has the most beautiful Graphics I have ever Seen That is based on a Anime! Most Video games That are based On Anime are lacking either lacking Visuals, Story plot, And mainly Graphics (which is what I look for in a game) Well Done, And for those of you who are complaining about Gacha summoning You always get a 5 star with the 10x summoning and there is no censorship and if there is they ALWAYS Compensate it! Anyways with that this was a terrific Game! Thanks for making it! üòÄüòÅ"
not fun at all. gambling simulator with bad frame rates.
gacha rates r bad but overall good
The gacha drops are way to low and half the time you have to pay for quartz to get them
"I I'm so we so N lllppllkdaxa zs Zhsge agavx y hüòòüòôüòÉüòÅüòâ ZvzVg me, sv"
LOOK UP AND BEHOLD! ENUMA ELISH!
well i had good rng so yeah...
"shiny turd of a game, worst gacha ive ever played in terms of rewards"
the salt in this is real
The game states you're garunteed a 4 star or better for a ten summon but that's not true at all. Not once have I gotten a 4 star or better from it. Game was fun until I realized it was not rewarding at all. Countless hours for nothing.
its a great game i love it (¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ)‚ô°
Amazing but drop rates suck A$$
I really loved the game but I'm only bummed about how I lost my acc all that hard work just gone in an instant
Nice and easy game with a good story
"Great time-sink for those who like Fate's characters. Otherwise, gameplay mechanics are pretty shallow. Progression comes down to luck, grind, and expendable income. For a simple gacha, though, it is undoubtedly polished and always has new content."
this game is really fun but you guys should increase the change of getting a 5 star servant and you should add a online trading system with other masters. thx for your time.
"I'm a fan of the original Fate materials (VN and anime) so naturally this game is a must to play. Adds some dimensions to the Fate universe especially with Servant stories, so I can see any fan of the original Fate series enjoying this. Good story and a diverse roster of servants. One can progress thru the story even without any SR servants so it's not really pay-to-win. My only problem though are the slow loading times. But other than that, I'm enjoying it a lot."
"A colossal waste of money. After spending hundreds, playing FGO for a good year now, I've gotten almost nothing to show for it, to the point where I feel stupid going for 5 stars campaign after campaign. For the cost, compared to other gacha games, the odds are ridiculously low, and there's no recourse but to accept your real money got you nothing, time and again. Spare yourself. Play something else."
no me gusto mucho pero tienen buenos servants PERO no me gusta que tengas que pagar para tener SSR 5 servants con dinero por eso no me gusta y que al principio te den a arturia por la quiero pero nunca NUNCA NUNCA la he tenido por eso la quiero por el anime por que es LA MEJOR WAIFU = >
"I won't ever recommend this game again. On 05/28/2019, I helped my brother's account with the daily logins because he was busy for 10 days and couldn't connect to the Internet. I already had my own account before so obviously didn't create another on my device. When he returned, I forgot to bind before giving it back and we accidentally sent for help from different emails. Then the support accused us for creating multiple accounts and refused explanation and apologies. They haven't replied, too."
great game...well i got into it because im a fan of nasu's writing and takeuchi's character designs
good story but bad rate ups
please make this into an anime with like 7 seasons filled with dozens of episodes
game is nice overall
Bad gatcha rates. Too much padding in story missions. Monotonous gameplay. Just watch the story on Youtube.
"*****UPDATE***** I officially uninstalled this game until y'all figure out why we can't transfer our data more than twice. I had a dope ass profile Altera, Zhuge Liang, Jack the ripper, Dark Altra, Vlad, Orion, atalanta, emiya, Joan of arc and the avenger, Medusa ruler or avenger I can't remember and its plenty of more 4 to 5 stars that I left out I lost my phone twice and your telling I have to start over.... all the quartz I bought to get them and when I do start over I have the weakest people"
Events are not beginner friendly.
I like it but i wish the drop rates would be more fair.
The game is good but gacha is on the other side. Literally impossible to gat an SSR servant no matter how many times you tried to roll. Especially the Rate Up's are a total lie...
UMU
"Downloaded game on 2 separate occasions. game will not even open at all. First when I click on it, it asks what to use to complete action and it lists my gmail or email app. Then after that it just wont start at all. I'm using a Note 8 so it should be fine"
Fantastic Story and a great way for fans of the franchise to enjoy their favorite characters very F2P friendly
"gacha game, play at your own risk haha"
"horrible pull rates, probably the worst ive encountered in a gacha game. They dont even try to offset this with an easier time to grind for saint quartz. To sum it up, not only does it have horrendous pull rates, but you also have hours and hours of grinding and the 10 summoning gacha only guarantees a 4 star card that can be craft essence too. Oh also if you want to pay, be prepared to shell out a chunk of cash for a measly amount of saint quartz and horrible pull rates."
"Game is overall good. Story, characters, plot pretty much everything. I have problens with the game though. I experience common crashes when I do raids or boss battles. Please fix the crashes for smoother gameplay for other players as well."
Fun game but Tech Support not helpful
it a good game
"Overall pretty nice. Almost every servant is viable to use and I like most character designs. The odds of drawing a 5* servant are pretty awful though, even for a gacha. The story is a bit slow to start, but gets pretty nice around the 6th Singularity. It's still good"
"It's good but be warned, it's a gacha game."
"i love this game. easy to play, but its hard to get 5 stars servant."
Keep the husbando coming!
gem wibu
Worst Gacha Rate Ever
its gud i love it
More fun than I imagined.
Extremely low % on summoning any 4-5 star characters with the majority of pulls resulting in cards which have little impact on the game. Another gatcha game forcing players to spend money on RNG.
I LOVE IIIIIIIT üòçüòçüòç
good fun
good game with ever improving graphics. Drop rates for ascension mats and heros are way too low. Devs are way to stingy with handing out summoning currency. Some balancing issues between heroes as well.
"It's not bad for an anime game at all. The gacha comes down to pure luck most of the time though, and the dialogue can be realllly, reallly, reallllly cheesy, but I guess that's typical to alot of weeb-bait games anyway. Don't expect stellar storytelling and a truly realistic cast, but with that aside it's legit a top of the bracket anime gacha game."
it suppose to be no star because the update keeps on repeating not updating the app :3
waifu waifu waifu
"After the latest update, i couldnt play anymore. Error code =1. They say its because my tab couldnt support but I was able to play before this."
I love the series and this game has me hooked.
I love this game not so much the gambling for the servants but the game itself pretty solid
"Friend uninstalled game to make room on my backup phone for another game. Wanted to get back into it but now hundreds of dollars of purchases are gone just like that because i no longer have a ""transfer code"". No Facebook backup option, outdated. Very upset and disappointed."
Y'all really gonna censor a character and keep absolutely dead silent on it? Nah.
amazing quality and good story
this game ruined my life 10/10
thicc thighs save lives
Big tiddy goth gf
I enjoy the storyline that is given. The game itself is also fun for me. I like that I don't have to play every chance I get but I am able to if I want to.
4 stars bc I can't get my waifus but still a pretty good game gets a bit repetitive tho
cute loli servants
"I want to give the game five stars but it keeps saying it didn't launch 
properly. It's really getting on my nerves. Everytime I clear the cache it 
has to re-download. I've done this twice now and I still have the same 
issue."
Awesome but I think Cu Chulainn(Lancer) should at least be a 4 star thats all I love this game
game is great
"Great story I've loved fate for a decade it obviously sticks to and extends the character's and story. also rate up is a lie and Memelin works if your lucky enough to summon him. For real amazing game if your a noob just stick with it, the hours you put in will pay off. 3* are really good as well can get you through almost the whole game with base 3*"
Solid game that keeps the feeling of the Fate franchise.
play style takes some adjustment but its a game I highly recommend
Magical potatoes do happen
It's good.
"Formerly a 5 star review, I've downgraded it simply because each update through the store demands over 120mb free space, suggests deleting all my apps, and downloads the 14mb update. Fix this."
"microtransaction heavy game. dont expect to see any decent play until you spend 50+ USD, or slog through the time sink of a campaign"
l love my waifusüëå
gimme ssr archer plox
"seriously fun, always new content, and its usually pretty easy to farm up materials. only problem i can say it has is that if your not careful, it can be a huge money pit. also the half naked little girls, could do without that"
Great! I feel like i'm watching an anime with a lot of episode
c o o l
"it is a fun game, great story, amazing charaters, breath taking artwork but if i have to complain about one thing it has to be a terrible gotcha rates but either way you should play this game"
fun game.
I like gameplay and all characters
please add foreigner already
go agane
this game is so amazing
I fell in love. The plot. I stayed for the the plot.
amazing gameplay nice story line beautiful artwork waifus hasbandos and gacha salt
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
addictive waifu simulator
best app evur
"Awesome graphics, gameplay and gacha rates!"
An amazing and awesome game!
Best Gacha meme
"This game is pretty fun to play, I wish the Gacha chances were a Bit bigger tho. Actually even without SSRS this game is great."
Nero is best girl!!
nice uwu
5star wallet drainer
Great game... Love the events...
"do u smoke despite knowing it's bad for ur health? do u still drink despite knowing that u still have to drive home? if yes then this is the game for u, it will suck all of u, ur time, ur money, ur sanity, ur social life. if u haven't played this game yet, run. run away and don't look back."
Totally worth your time (save me please)
"Really, it brings out the whale inside you..... But other than that, this game is good"
"The game is fun and the events are really fun to play, the fequent time events comes in really helps ppl who hates grinding"
"Great game, and the vn-like story is really amazing and immersing. Lots of Educational Materials and Waifus too."
"Why do people play this game even if the gacha rates are abysmal? The answer comes in a few words that distill the essence of Fate: characters, story, and the imagination. The game is clever in that clearing a lot of the content, especially the story, does not require spending any money. You are not required to get any rare characters to progress or beat missions. But the characters are iconic, lovable, and have both a personality and a backstory to love. If that's your cup of tea, play FGO."
SALT!!!!!!!
Its got the big tiddies and the bad gacha rates. what more could i ask for?
not as good as gbf tho.
such a great game with touching stories
Tamamo no Mae Summer Goddess
Great Story . And beautiful Drawing
love this game to death. but the gatcha is hell
Good Game. Once you start playing you can't stop. Now give me SQ.
A great game!
will make it 5* if i ever get one O:
"rate up is a lie, and merlin will never come home Kappa"
Pretty good! Low gacha rates but the Story is awesome
"It's a great game and I love it. Animations are spot on and the story line reels you in and never lets you go. While the gotcha rates suck at times, it's just life and reviews are supposed to be about the gameplay itself. (You can get by with 3* and there's events where you get a guaranteed 5* once or twice a year)"
top tier waifu game
has waifus
Still happy playing even with low luck I'm not yet done because I haven't got my favorite yet
"Loved Fate and its storytelling for a long time now, and this game is a welcome addition to the Fate multiverse! Great servant collection and dynamic music to go with the stories and events, as well as comic relief and decent battle system. The gacha rate is pretty low on average if you want a 5 star servant, but events offer free 4 stars that can make up for that, barely. :p"
Give me more quartz
Best. Gacha. Game. Ever.
"10/10 would roll again but in all seriousness, this game is great. While it slowly catches up to the jp server, NA does a fine job progressing. While some things may be censored and rewards that are not as good as jp, NA deserves no hate and should be supported by the people who translated all of the scenes even if the translation is not perfect. And yes we all know FGO is notourious for the low rates, but it still encourages F2P with the free summon tickets and fragments."
"- Unfair summoning rates: always got 1*-3* Servants, and essence cards. 4* Servant or higher are impossible. This is my #1 complaint. - Spending real life currency to buy Saint Quartzs to get more chances to obtain 4* Servants and 5* Servant is considered gambling. It's absolutely not worthy to spend. - Story progression and challenges are beyond reasonable. Massive Health/Hit Points (HP) of all Servant bosses and high rank monsters is not considered challenge but discourage to the new players."
"Type-Moon did a great job with this game. They improved the concept of a typical gacha game, by not creating a pay wall, and allowing everyone to get access to all content. This game is story rich (the quality of a great visual novel inside a cellphone), character rich(100+ unique heroes with amazing art and original japanese voice acting) and very well maintained. The only warning that i leave is that, some people can't stand the random results of the gacha. Do your research and roll wisely. :)"
goof
good gach fun game
best app I installed
sabor so thicc
well its a good game although the gatcha rates are low its still good because you can get 4star servants in events its all good hahaha some people are too damn salty because they dont have a sr or ssr sevant i have 3 sr servants i get it all from the events
gud game but rate up is a lie
awsome graphics and game play
OMG I LOVEEEE THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!
There is a bug in Yan Qing's animation its a good game great for people like me who like History and adventure I would say I will give u five star if u fix Yan Qing's Bug
I spent $100 on their premium currency and only got 1 champion that was 5 stars (max level) from their lootboxes. The story is nice though.
I like the game that gives you commands That gives your choices of classes and gives you free gifts Events and updates I also like the classes abilities each one has Their own attack it's to bad the I do not have a enough memory for my phone.
"Game immediately crashes on Samsung Galaxy 8. I've played full 3D, 360¬∞ games this. Crashing shouldn't even happen."
"Here on FGO NA, you're treated as second-class citizens compared to the 
other servers. Don't even dare dream about faster event pace, quality of 
life update, good translation quality or equal rewards like what the 
Japanese, Chinese and the Korean servers have."
Great game and storyline is awsome
"Start whaling!! Once the US government passes the law to ban gacha, you can kiss your waifus goodbye!!"
It's good bro
probably one of the best gacha i ever played. my wallet broke tho XD
"loses connection to game server often, if not just downright freezes on me... please fix ;; o ;;"
A joy to play with a real story. Unlike many mobile games it feels like something more then just a way to get mirco transaction money.
fun and great art
pls give me new ssr
"Gatcha, gatcha....im melting--gudako"
"cannot even open the game, it takes me to an email and states that I cannot play this game where I live. I live in georgia, USA."
It one best I had to play and good events as well and good characters in the game
una beses ko pa lang lalaruin hehe
I have played FGO for almost 2 years now due to the fact that it has a strong story lines and events that made it so interesting to play. Even if most of the people whine about the percentage of summon drops from their favorite servants that they cant get. Trust me and try to play this game too :)
By far the worst gacha game I've ever played
Awesome! All Fate fans will enjoy!
"If you like Fate, you will like this"
decent game needs more action though
"fun for the more lighthearted history/mythology nerd, and waifu/husbando aficionados, a little grindy and sometimes really rough on the RNG, overall a fun experience with a community of humorous people for the most part, spend lightly when you want to."
I love the game the graphics are great and the gameplay is addictive
waifu!
"I LOVE MY BIG TIDDY MOMMY GF IN GAME!!! SHE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE! SHE IS THE PERFECT WOMAN FOR ME! SHE TREATS ME LIKE HER OWN KID I LOVE IT! SHES IS AMAZING LIKE A GODDESS ALTHOUGH I ALREADY HAVE A GODDESS TOO IN GAME! I CANNOT PUT THE GAME DOWN EVEN AFTER BEATING ALL OF THE FIRST 7 SINGULARITIES AND THE LAST ONE TOO THIS GAME IS JUST AMAZING! 100,000/10 THOUGH THE GACHA IS RARTED SOMETIMES BUT ITS OKAY NOT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT MY LUCK IS JUST BAD I LOVE YOU FATE:GO DEVELOPERS!!!‚ô°"
Nice story and animation
mikon over umu
"uhh, Obviously no need for Explanation"
I love the game but crappy gacha percentage and ascention mats drop... And i hope you guys use a link account to google function...
love it! the characters have such personality and the battle system is simple but challenging.
"i like the game and the character designs, the abilities, but i think gacha rates need to be slightly higher."
Great game but cant remember my password i recently switched phones and tried to sign in but forgot what my password is
"I absolutely love this game. If you love the fate franchise, or gacha games you need to play this. You dont need the rarest characters to beat the main story or even events. The rates are low but that means you really have to save or have EX rank luck. we get a good amount of freebies as well. One of the best gacha games out there."
so fun i love it
Gatcha hell
it was great but now that it's dine whats next
I only roll on banners with hot babes.
"Not recommended, because you will use all your money for gacha"
Luck EX
"""ye who enter here abandon all hope -dante's inferno"" is the perfect explanation of this game. This game will make you cry and salt but mostly salt, you think that ""wow i should avoid this game then"" well you should. This game is like one of those game stands you find in a carnival. except they cheat and when they feel generous and they cheated enough people they let some of those """"lucky"""" people win and when you're one of those winners then, you'll see why this game is so addicting. 5/5 stars"
One of the best turn based comprehensive RPG I've played. I've been following the JP version since it's launch and I've played the english version too since it's launch and it had not disappointed me. It's a bit behind on the servants and the story but well it's a version made after the JP version so that is to be expected.
Best game ever made in phone. it make a lot of fun
cant even retrieve my acc anymore
good storytelling an graphics bad anything else don't take my word you will see after playing couple months and feel the grinding and poor summon rate's
it has always been an amazing game. And I absolutely love the Fate Universe in general. absolutely amazing.
"I like the story, lore, and characters, but the gacha roll is broken and frustrating for me. also, rate up is a lie"
"Came for Astolfo, but I realized that the graphics were pretty bad on my eyes. They looked pretty ugly. The gameplay wasn't too engaging either."
screw rng
is amazing
"Its funny how people not accustomed to gacha games say that the rates are absurdly low. Like come on ! Its a freakin gacha game. XD Although I agree that the rates for SSR is a little low but thats what makes this magical. Lol seriously, just enjoy the game and let the gacha be with you. Friendly reminder : ""GACHA moderately and Yorokobe Shounen !"""
I love the series and I love this game Fate is AMAZING so everything with it is AMAZING
"can't even play, gives out error everytime"
"keeps telling me no connection when i have full bars, waste of time"
"Good game, good gameplay but abysmal worth. the draw rates for this game are the absolute worst of all gacha games. I'm sure this makes the dev's tons of money with whales but it actively drove me away from it"
"A lot of negative reviews seem to be because of pure salt. The gacha rates are supposed to be low so you truly feel rewarded rolling a 5 star servant, rather than being handed everything to you. The story itself is somewhat interesting but I have more fun leveling the servants I really love and bonding with them. At the end of the day it's gameplay is fun and rewarding when you play with your favorite husbando or waifu. If you're reading this may good luck come to your rolls :)."
"The game play is meh, but everything else is brilliant. The story is worth millions and the art is to die for."
"I loved Fate/Apocrypha, Zero, and Stay Night UBW. This game brings back memories of so many characters."
game just instantly crashed after installing
the drop rate from banners are abysmal. did about 10 pulls and didnt get single 5*.
this low effort trash is destroying the japanese gaming industry
üòâ
Great game completely outshines the Anime in every way possible
BEST GAME i have ever played :3
"Great game to have, especially if you're a fan to fate!"
Data cannot be recovered.
Good Game to play and I love and I really if is there a Free To choose your first Gold Servant pls
My servants... They've cost me everything. Great job devs!
the drop rates make me want to kill myself
Crash a lot after BB event update
After the latest update the app isn't functioning properly. HELP!?
"Great game, brutal rates."
really like collecting all the characters. Game is a bit of a mindless grind but that's perfect for the trip into work - can turn it off whenever!
I love fate grand order as well as the character design quality I also a big fan of the fate anime series. Good Job and keep it up.
"cant even play it...hangs on saber's excaliber then boom, white screen"
"The characters are amazing, the story is refreshing and the gameplay is okay. The game uses the background of the Fate franchise to establish its setting and it does it quite well! The usage of Singularities and servants prove very entertaining, especially considering that servants are inspired from historical figures from our reality. I do believe the detriment in gameplay stems from the inability to quickly do battles via skipping the NP. Overall, the game is quite satsifying to play."
I love this game so much ! the only thing I don't like it that the update isn't downloading ? i'm trying but it won't work :( my daily login won't count in 9 minutes and im anxious about it
best app but couldve been better if it has better gacha
"Have tried installing this game multiple times, but have never been able to open it. I have a Samsung Galaxy S9 and never have issues with other games that are available via Google Play. What gives?"
Fun I can so Why its so popular
"I can't believe it! A ""Free"" App game that isn't a total money scam! If you like Fate games, give it a go!"
about as good as you'd expect a free to play turn based rpg to be
"Absolutely the best RPG, I've played in a while. The animations and characters just bring the game together. All around great story and gameplay."
really good gameplay amazing
I love my waifu
One of the best mobile game I've played
Quite Epicüòé
greatest mobile rpg
worth playing if your a fan of the anime
dumb how you get saints quartz crystals
I like how this game takes people soul out of them
It's a good!
"I personally love this game. the art is beautiful, the story has some silly glitches sometimes but it kind of adds to the uniqueness, and the play style is simple yet classic. it's kind of like an old turn style based rpg. not to mention, I dig that all of the characters are either referenced from historical people or added in as a fantasy character associated with said history. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of turn based rpgs."
great waifu simulator
great game but a little slow on the dialogue scenes and it would be nice to have an English translation.
"Really good game, the story keeps me playing non-stop. I actually enjoy this gacha system because even though 5stars are rare, you don't need them to progress."
trash app wont give ssr and salt
"If you become the endgame player, quartz rewards are too small and no guranteed system for a ssr unless you spend in anniversary banners which is a joke. Not to mention event paces are too slow. Don't try to play. There are other gacha games better than this. If you like story, try watching them in youtube lol. Don't waste your time and money for this game."
give me Edmond Dantes!
"the rates for getting good summons is terrible, but it's still fun. it has a very unique set of mechanics that makes combat different from anything else you've ever played and the story is actually quite compelling at times."
its great
pt good
a really addictive game
„É≠„Éì„É≥„Å®ÂúüÊñπÂçÅÂõõÈÉé„ÅåÂ•Ω„Åç„Åß„Åôüíôüíöüíõüíï(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)
Very fun and time consuming. I love the game overall.
"It's a very good game; however, there is no easy way to save your data in case you forget to send a transfer code. Please add a function that allows one to same their data via Facebook, Google Play or by a username with a password. I have fallen victim to this because reset my phone to get rid of malicious software, and I forgot to issue a transfer code."
"I think the story on this game is great, and I would love to see it on television. The character pulls on the other hand are just bad. Has been about a year and the 5 star servants are hiding from me. Don't see myself playing it for too long."
Best story out of all Mobile Games i've played.
5 stars because this is the place where my waifus exist
"I'm in too deep, someone help."
"The game is very entertaining and simple enough for anyone to enjoy. My only complaint is that Li Shuwen is a Lancer and not an Assassin, like he is supposed to be."
like it
Absolutely the most fun Mobile game I've ever played I love the series and the characters It's easy to learn and if you don't mind the grind Then you're gonna have a good time
"Great game to play. Gacha can be harsh at times, but is still enjoyable. perfect for any fan of the Fate/ animes and VN."
fun story fun concept but it's a gacha mobile game that I would never spend money on as frustrating as that may be.
"Nice game, 5 star if not for the gacha hell"
Love it!!!
I have spent so much money on this game
The deck and team building are amazing!
Absolute Perfection.
Rates suck but the game's pretty good for focusing on the storytelling the Nasuverse VNs are known for.
"its a very good game, though the gatcha is a bit salty but the story is great and the gameplay is great."
"Solid mobile RPG. Classic Fate characters meet new faces in a well written and engaging story. Well maintained game that is always developing and improving. Frequent events keep gameplay fresh and exciting while providing new challenges. Gatcha based game however, so some days RNGesus is kind and sometimes your forsaken for months on end."
Just play it...
Would be a five star Gacha game if the SSR pull rates weren't so dismal.
one of the best games available. hard to out down.
"I love this game. An attractive character for every preference. Engaging combat. And best of all, history jokes."
"The gacha rates for FGO are so bad, you can save or purchase as many Saint Quartz as you eant, youll always get the same 3 star servants and craft essences. Even if you do happened to get 4 or 5 star pulls, its rarely ever any Servants. Storyline can be a bit boring at times and some character designs and personalities really could use some improvement. Just overall disappointed with the rewards and gacha rates compared to other games I play."
"A game were almost every player will be able to find characters they absolutely adore, the problem is that most of the time, the chances of getting those characters is only 4% (5 star and 4 star servants.) I love the gameplay and the amount of freedom in it, you can play in almost any style you want if you can make a good team, be it stalling, taking your time criting or going with buster damage. The story is INSANELY good and easily worth downloading the game just for it. Easy 5 stars for me."
rate up is a lie lol
Fun and adfictive.game Above all where my MHXA TT
I love this game but please add an pvp or an arena
"The rate ups can feel deceptive but I enjoy the gameplay. The turn based combat is simple but effective. I haven't ever felt that I needed to spend money to ""win"" but having servants with better stats / skills certainly makes the game a little easier."
Best Game
"It's probably one of the best mobile games that I have ever had the pleasure of playing by taking full advantage of a variety of inticing characters and a universe that lends itself well to any multitude of stories, it's nothing less than exceptional."
"great game with good story, the power creep can be handled with good support from friends and the command spell is like a cheat to win the round easily without needing to have a good servant. in regards to the ppl who say its p2w they're wrong, just look at me. spend no money on this game still complete its current chapter and finish its event. welfare servant are good enough to complete the game so are the lower tier servant with right support and strategy."
"Awesome game, awesome franchise. üíñ"
love it when jalter insults me and calls me master
"Great characters, some of the story is really good. Suffers from downright merciless RNG ""micro""transactions though."
i am human
"Not for a casual anime fan, that's for sure. To fully enjoy FGO, you'd need to have read the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, maybe Tsukihime also, watched Fate/Zero and Fate/Apocrypha, played Fate/Extra and basically other stuff in the Nasuverse."
Fun when u can summon decent 5-Star servants
Great game. It's taken all of my money.
"great game, but not for your wallet #F2PBTW"
I love this game. thats all.
This Game is Hell And I have no plans to leave it
Best salt ever
gacha rates are absolute trash but I love the game and anime lol
Fun game not for beginners but I highly recommend to people who enjoy gachas
Yorokobe Shonen Rate Up is a Lie LOL
"I love the content this games offers, summoning is kinda off but it makes sense do to the challenges you have to face, I love the daily log in awards and the events it offers, this game contains historical event and people such as Shakespeare and Da vinic, this game offers so many challenges and servants, can't wait for more content to come."
Addicting. The rate is not a problem.
doesn't link to any other accounts so if you forget to write down your code your account is just gone
The only issue I have with this game truly is that you need to initiate a data transfer to continue where you left off if you uninstalled the game even if you're trying to continue on the same device. That's a pretty hard blunder to overlook and needs to be addressed sooner than later.
Great game no need to send money unless you want to support the Dev team. If you've followed the visual novel or the anime you see many of your favorites in the game.
Absolutely love the game. not truly a pay no win since you can do 95% of the content with worked on 3 stars but it feels nice to pull 5 stars. Type moon also gives very few gems for beginners but the game is fun and a decent rpg.
ok great game
its a cool time killer and ive watched the show thats why i like it so much plus no need to spend money
"Great game, very addicting. However, the gacha seems very unbalanced so far. I have been playing for a while and eventually saved up around 200 saint quartz, I didn't use any quartz after tutorial summon. I was expecting some 4 stars and at least one 5 star. I was hopelessly wrong i got nothing but 3 stars, this really ruins the gameplay experience. I wish that the rates are higher or just to lower the price to purchase quartz. Otherwise, I love the storyline and gameplay."
terrible rates and garbage introduction for players.
"Only 4 stars because of salt, I still play this game daily. I've come to adore all of the characters and the story they have to tell."
"overall during my journey playing this game. id say that ive had a satisfactory experience however, i am still not a fan of the drop rates during summoning. trying to hit that 1% is like trying to find a needle in a stack of hay. i love the fate series so i figure why not try the game and boy ill tell you. this is a very addictive game."
loading is so slow
The Game is fantastic! üëå love it!
Keeps crashing now. Can't even get to main menu
"Welcome to gacha hell. Ready to test out your luck? If you want to play the Japanese server, go download QooApp. It's an app that let's you download Japanese versions of games. It's an alright site I guess. Not trying to advertise or anything, just wanted to put this out for people who want to play the JP server instead of the US server."
"At this point this gacha game is pretty archaic, slow loading times, no auto targeting often resulting in attacks being wasted on enemies that are already dead. Story Is pretty damn boring. It's pretty nice that there are 4 star and 5 star servants being released monthly, the downside to this of course is that the summon rate is so horrendous you'll probably never own any of them without paying. Epic7 pretty much perfected everything this game started making this game a waste of time"
"Absolutely terrible game with a massive amount of amateur bugs. Clearly nothing but a money scheme hatched by some rich, shallow, person."
"well-made, thanks for the game!"
i cant open the apppppppp. uninstalled bye
Game is great for Fate series fans. Got some minor bugs and connectivity issues once in a while but nothing game breaking. Just wish that they could register our accounts to our emails. So there will be no risk of losing data.
horrible chance at getting anything good or anything you like and most likely you will get gold sabers over anything else other than it being a massive pay to win which good luck even trying that waste of money i love the game
good game but the grine might be abit to griny for me to score it higher
I dont know I have a Samsung Galaxy j7 prime but when I open the game it force closes and I cant play
"Repetitive gameplay, questionable character designs, abysmal gacha rates.. But, I'm still playing it so they must be doing something right. The story is interesting enough even with some awkward translations, and there are enough characters that there's basically someone for everybody (personally, I like that tamamo cat girl.) Not for those with gambling issues however."
"The game is fantastic, have been playing for a while now but my only faulter for this game is that they need to make a way to where you could farm more saints quarts by resetting free quest for more quarts and raise ap. other then that its really fun and addicting"
Hoping to Recover My Account So Please Return It...
wow its great
it's awesome
needs solo mode.
Event heroes lock behind a stupid grind walls and the frustrated boss fight! the boss fight itself lock behind another grindwall! whole CCC event is more frustration than fun!
"Despite the Rates, This is a Gacha Game that keep pulling you back with amazing story, ignoring the first 4 chapters. As well as characters that feels like characters with personality with actual voice dialogue instead of a wall of text and rarity. I highly recommend even for newcomers to the Fate Franchise."
Really Great Game.I Really Enjoy It.But I Hope It Will Get Feature Update Soon.
"This game is awesome but the only problem is that it has blue borders on the side of the screen and that sucks you cant play it in full screen, also the fps is really low and there is no option to make it 60fps."
Good Simple Game
This game is so AWESOME!!!! Hope they make an anime about this.
Dead game 1* I'll vote 5* if 5* servants come to me :) Got Angra today.... hmm.... toang vcl
got charged for 20 dollars i want a refund
"It still has bugs, it needs to update when i press retry to continue it stops completely"
Playing for over a year and have yet to pull 5* game is being uninstalled and thrown in the digitrash where it belongs.

"The game is great. I'm just wondering, isn't that a 10 x summon guarantees a 4 star or above servant? How come I had only received several 3 stars. Thanks and hope you can help me."
doesnt work on samsung note9
I love F/GO althought it's often make me salt

"Great graphics, mechanics, gameplay, gacha hates me though"
"One super amazing game for a fgo hardcore fan and even if ur not a fgo fan,this game is totally the best I mean 1000000000/10 it's so amazing,pls gacha give me the servants I wish I have pls"
tuy√™Ã£t v∆°ÃÄi :v

"dont spend money on this game or you'll find the game as a black hole that sucks your money. other than that, the gameplay itself is pretty good and frankly as far as I can tell servants aren't OP so at least summoning doesn't actually break gameplay. PS:pls let me use USB debugging god damn it"
a very great game with a wide variety of characters. though everything comes with your luck. spend every money u have and you still cannot get the best thing out of the game without luck.
"a very fun game but I only rate it as 2 stars because of the stupid reset and the fact that you have to reset your transfer code every single time for the upload, it's really freaking stupid. if someone could fix it so we don't have to keep resetting the code just so we can access our account again, but if not this whole game is a joke basically a slap in the face to fans. offense but I'm really getting sick and tired of having to log back in with a code just access my account"
"I... I'm never gonna get my lady Artoria... q~q Nevertheless, this game is really fun and very addicting. I've never been so addicted to a mobile game... they get a few downpoints for treating the player in a pretty masculine way and implying them to be male even if they pick the female player character, though. I VIEW MASH AS MY DAUGHTER, BUT IT FEELS LIKE EVERY TIME I'M NICE TO HER I GET SHIP TEASE. I... I want ship tease with C√∫... ANYWAY, so far the game has been a truckload of fun! :D"
Waifu all day long
i loveeee illyasviel von einzbern! please make her success roll rate up! in this coming Prisma banner
CRAZY GUDAKO GACHA!!! I LOVE GACHAAA!!!
Hindi pa umuuwi si Ozymandias
What happened to all my data I worked hard to get??? Everything is gone!
fun game but the gotcha can be be hell
I love NASUVERSE... ‚úîÔ∏è
drop rates make me wanna die but im pretty lucky so f@#k it heres 5 stars
"Really a fun game that's not too hard but is challenging. The only challenge is the Gacha, i never get what i want huhu. The story is really fun and the gameplay is really smooth, no crashing. Please consider adding Charlemagne from extella pleaaassseee huhu"
salty gatcha but great story
"Best JRPG I've played in *years.* More fun than games you have to pay for up front, but without the bloat or overwrought pretentiousness. Fun and doesn't take itself all that seriously until the parts when it should. Can't recommend it enough."
Good Game but Trash rates and Trash Developers.
honestly fun game. they also made it less racist. thank you.
fun and fast paced. love it
"The story is wonderful. Really wonderful.. The gacha rates might be bad, but having really strong lower star Servants makes up for it. The materials used for ascension also have a bad drop rate but it is compensated by events. The game also gives "" Welfare Servants "" that can really help the player to push through the game. The game is not about gacha... Because this game is about the story... The story of reclaiming our future... Fate/ Grand Order."
Mom said i could become anything. So i became a whale
Favorite game.
emailed them for account recovery but no response I quit... this game needs a Facebook or Google login
"The loading time is killing this game for me. Every time i try to do something it hits you with a loading screen that takes a really long time. I have a cheap old octo-core phone. It could be that, but i doubt it. I run games with way better graphics than this and they play fine. I even downloaded the extra content to see if it would help. Nothing. I can't do it. It's too slow."
Nothing but a scam that plays on your love of the characters and series. Definitely P2W.
a bit stingy with the premium currency but really like the art style and guaranteed gachas.
I remember how I lost my phone and the rest of my account along with it...
played for months and couldn't pull a 5 star with tons of saint quartz
I have played it before I hope my progress is not lost.
5 stars becuz I have Meltlilith
"Gets really tedious and boring after a bit, rates at pulling actual enjoyable characters are extremely low, easy to lose interest in, but it is a decent game."
I like playing the game
"Really great game. I got two 4 star servants and one 4 star-craft essence on my free 1st time 10 spins edit: still playing, no 5 stars yet but alot of 4 stars which is great!"
amzing
played this game when it first launched. loved it so much. But here's the rub... if you upgrade to a new phone make sure you get a transfer code for the game. if you dont you lose EVERYTHING! and unless you know intimate details about your account you will not be able to get it back. even of you spent money on the game. There is no way to authenticate your account without specific details. The game has no support for syncing to a Google or Facebook account. Awful. I lost everything.
This game is rigged. It is not rewarding. Will only end up pissing you off.
clunky in a vary weird way
Forced out from first battle Couldnt even continue the game if i keep getting forced out on the furst battle again and again. Ill try again another time.
"The game by itself has good and bad characteristics - It is a gacha game and not a mother to give anything you want.  Personally, I play since January 2018 and I like the main story - mainly after ""E Pluribus Unum"" (USA singularity). Almost all characters are at least good enough and I cannot complain about the events.  But the most important thing in this game is the support. I can tell about it, because I got a great help from them after making a mistake about my account - I simply had forgotten to take note about my ID number before unistalling the game to fix a connection issue.  The support just asked for some confirmation about the servants and other stuff to check. I didn't even lose a login streak.  Trust me, man... This support is great and, lately, services with a good support to customers are difficult to find out."
"Gacha is not really good. Everything else (gameplay, graphics, freebies, etc.) are satisfactory."
if you like playing a game where doesn't take money to progress don't play this game
Reply to my ticket please! My log in streak will be lost
would be better if they made an offline version for people without connection availability
"Been a Fate fan since 2006 but this game is just how low they can go, dont waste your money, there putting the cash into there own pockets (lawsuit recently), with the money they have, they can do better than this trash money milking gacha gambling game, with terrible lazy gameplay, and art. There is an arcade version, but even thats just terrible cookie cutter gameplay with 3D modules."
love the game in everything but since the bb event was install i keep disconnecting in it keep getting worst.I might not be able to get her if this keep up. hope you fix this quick and give us more days for this event
cant olay it on my oneplus 6T for some reason
"5 5Stars out of 5 stars, would 5 star again"
No pity rewards for people who spent thousands of SQs and got nothing (no 5*)
Best story in any mobile game.
Fate/Grand Order? More like Fate/Grand loader. First half hour was spent in ~60% load screens.
the update won't let me play!
Tried to login today and keep looping into cannot connect to server error....im not sure where my transfer code is and i dont want to uninstall and reinstall....halp!
"Fate/Grand Order is yet another waifu-collecting gacha game (the male to female ratio in this game is like 1 to 3). It also is one of the most unforgiving with an incredibly low 1% 5-star (SSR) rate. Of course, lower rarity servants (characters) are still decent to use but are generally outclassed by 5-stars.New players, f2p, and just generally unlucky people will probably have the hardest time getting through the game. Still, the gameplay is quite engaging and fun compared to other gachas."
Works smoothly on my Pixel. Remember this is just a mobile game.
Black screen and stopped working immediately after opening the app. Lg v35
love this game.
So I Downloaded The Yesterday and when i open it just crashes I dont know what to do Pls.Help Me
So far it's been a blast playing this game and seeing hopefully more future content if it does happen so hopefully it will.
Bar none changed my mine on mobile gaming. Couldn't recommend this title enough.
This is best game
very nice üëå
"Grinded since November for 100 Saint Quarts, only for them to go to waste on 3 Star Crafting Essence on the Sakura Banner. I rest my case."
"never seen a game so generous like this game before just the story of this game is worth atleast 30$ long hour play with free contents, good story and events. Highly recommended guys."
"6+ in game hours and finally able to get enough to multi summon for the first time. Guaranteed 4 star summon failed and I'm left with nothing but hate for this ultra grind game. I can appreciate and understand when a company ask for micro transactions on a free game but when the basic functions are broken and the game waste a great deal of the users time with no reward ultimately destroys any reason to play this game. My advise, dont waste your time if you dont want to drop money on this app."
God dam cash grab...
"[NEED DEV TEAM HELP] Why suddenly i cant play the game with my device? I can play normally yesterday, but now its flashback/forced close. I already play the game with this device several month. My Device: Xiaomi Black Shark"
Best Mobile Game
The gacha grabs you it pulls you in it never lets you go save yourselves the waifus are too strong it is too late for me SURVIVE
Would be nice if you would support a flagship phone model that is 2+ years old
You should probably add transfer data and make it easier for everyone to save their data and I have to restart all over again
"I love this game and redownloaded it recently, wanting to play it again. It used to work on my phone, but now I get an error every time I try to launch it saying it's not supporting on the environment of my device. Please fix this, if possible."
"it's not my type of game, but I sure do reccomend people who want to devote their time and effort into this game. the story line is great and so is the art. 5/5!"
crashes on startup after opening. also lost data from original account due to no binding to Google Play from the looks of it
its amazing whenever the update came i got 4 4 stars in 1 multi summon its awesome
Better than expected. Haven't been addicted to a game in a long time. Story is good considering the restrictive format. Performance could be better on lower end devices.
"Very disappointed with the animations in this game, that is all."
Fun and easy to get into and a great storyline
still doesnt work on chromebook sadly :(
very addictive game
Game should be renamed to fate grand loading. You spend more time loading than playing
"Good time sink, a little bit pay-to-win, but if you play smart it should be easy enough to get through the campaign with little to no money"
Its hell to farm but the way u can melt enemies is just amazing when u can
"great game with a good story, and lots of variability in teams. fun and easy gameplay, only real complaint is my terrible pull luck"
The game is super lameüòê
the only game you need to play.
"In general it's a turn based JRPG with a really famous anime ip in Japan. The main stories are the very soul of this game. Make sure you judge after finishing Ch 7. The gacha rate is pure gambling with almost no ganrantee for F2P players, however the game is still beatable without any 5 stars. Unlike other games, it really takes time to journey yourself through, including raising servants. Make peace with your greeds, If you are anxious about getting everything it will cost a great deal."
Thx for the servants
Even free characters can beat almost all content
Give me more Quartz.
Can you please update so it doesn't crash on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and I'll give it a different rating.
"Seems like a pretty cool game. Animation is great, music is great, gameplay is fun. But the beginning is absolutely infuriating. It's really irritating when you're trying to find a stopping point and the game is shoehorning you into doing mission after mission without access to the menu or party customization or anything at all until a decent amount of progress into the game is made. There's nothing worse than being in between missions and having only one icon you can select with the rest of the screen grayed out over and over again."
Good game but will be better if there is something like increasing rate of getting SSR after every pull
Too. Many. Grind.
So addicting. If you love the anime you'll love this game too.
"YOROKOBE, SHOUNEN‚Äî‚Äî KIMI NO NEGAI WA YOUYAKKU KANAU"
The game bugged out on my phone when I have been playing this game for a good amount of time. now it is saying that it's unplayable. I lost my account because of this bug and had not set a transfer code. I tried contacting the support team but no one is responding. Worst customer support ever. edit: I made an attempt to recover my account and after giving them great detail about it and they STILL did not give me recovery permissions. I am never promoting this game anywhere ever again.
"Great game, for those who love the fate series!"
"Single rolled for the past banners (Arthur to CCC). Never got what I wanted. Decided to give it a chance with 10 pull in Melt's banner, it didn't even bother giving me decent CEs, just 2 4* event CE (the other is event a duplicate) and the rest are 3*. Waited for my 150 days login streak, single rolled all of them, all I got are all 3* servant and ces. I don't have sq left so I quit haha."
never mine i cant even play it
there is a bug where attack doesnt appear
this is an awesome game
"So I just started playing this game for about 1 week and really thank the developers to give a 10 summon on the 7th day. I started the game with only heracles from my tutorial summons. N was troubled as I could not ascend him further until next event. Luckily, the game heeded my call and gave me a servant similar to the review I'm giving. Thanks game:) Edit: Really can't thank this game enough. Gave me another 5 star on the same day. Thanks game:)"
I got Melt :DDDDD
cool game but its NOT in English
The game is amazing
AMAZING!
Not consumer friendly and too grindy
best archer is games
slower gameplay than what I would've wanted. a bit boring. no auto battles
excellent
After a year and some of playing this I still like it. ^_^
"I would enjoy the game more if the drop rates weren't so horrible. Compared to other games, this game is a rip off."
my game won't run and keeps giving me the clear cash thing but when i do it wont load what's going on?
Fun game but the new blue bars on the sides are awful for OLED screens. Please add an option to turn them off. Thanks!
the game is great even though my E rank luck sometimes pissed me off to degree
blarg eye say . blarg .
i love fate the show so im sure I will love this game i got into it in 8 seconds flat im 89 btw (i lie)
"While the game is nice, lacking community interaction with the devs and being treated in a way that is unfair compared to other servers stink of mismanagement and lack of care for this NA server making it seem like a cash grab and not a l genuine attempt to provide a service"
its a fun game
Thank the gods for adding a back button in the battle screen! That was always one of my biggest annoyances that if you accidentally hit attack you couldn't go back. Thanks!üòÅ
I love fate good job with the updates to.
drop rates kind suck but overall it a good game.
. . .
"Great story and the characters are really well written. Overall a great 
game."
Good kill yur time game
Best Wifu Game Ever
Game is great but the drop rate is miserable and nothing except the twice yearly guaranteed summons off set it.
Honestly a great game but the rates are terrible
is cool now
Give me a 5 star servant please.
the censorship bothered me
10/10 will sell my soul to the gacha again
I love this franchise and this game is a great addition to the series!
üçç
It got my character Gilgamesh and lancer
Cant play it... it says there's an error
"very good and fun, but the drop rates for the 5-stars? and even just the 4-stars? and how compared to other gacha games the sheer infrequency with which you get to do a 10 roll is absolutely absurd and nearly offensive. if you have the iron-will to never spend money ever on gacha games, then its wonderful. otherwise you'll wish you could whale."
"Excellent game, especially for fans of the Fate anime (granted it is their target audience). I have had countless hours of fun and so have a numerous amount of friends to whom I have recommended this game. All in all this is probably my favorite app ever and the only one I doubt I will ever uninstall. Thank you for the hours of fun!"
Very addicting.
"i love the app, i been a bit of a fan of the series for some time and i say this game is worth playing. yeah the chances of getting high class servants is 1/100000000000 but its still amazing!"
Been playing for a year and a half as an f2p and have never felt the need to whale
its a really fun game
amazing game with excellent knowlege of past heros in mythology
wonderful rpg game
coool
I play only for waifus and it's kinda worth it
gameplay is nice -1 star for gotcha rates and -1 for very fequent crashing and problems updating game
"Love the game and the story behind it. But its a gacha game so the reality of you getting that one five star you wanted is down the drain, unless you spend a good $80 or more, unless you save up and then use them all on that single banner."
lit af
it's all right I just wish this will work on that glitch while I'm fighting
worst gacha system
great fun for any fans of the fate series
10/10 Gacha Salt
"fun as hell, but the chances of getting a servant above 3 star is way too low. only way to get a good servant with any regularity is to spend a lot of money on quartz, and even then the drop rate means spending around $100 to get 2 4 or 5 star servants."
"This game was doing very well in not censoring itself for a western audience like so many other mobile games from Japan do. Then 'Emiya Alter' came out and they changed his skin color (lighter) so he looks ""less black"". If that wasn't bad enough it is also a pretty poor edit as well. TLDR: Censorship is bad."
Waifus are hard to get *Edit* Waifu obtained and many more saber faces. no jalter tho*Edit 2* my luck is garbage -1 starüóø
This game is absolutely fun and addicting!
"game play is good,"
"I had always enjoyed watching Fate Unlimited Bladeworks and the other series of Fate until i then stumble upon this game, and when i first started it was an amazing start for me as i have been waiting for a game like this to come, the events there are and the many characters from the anime brings me joy to see them all though with trying to obtain them it can be a bit of a pain but in due time they will soon be achieved and obtained, i hope more comes out and i can highly reccomend this game."
Everything about the game has been fun so far I just wish the in game currency was a bit cheaper. math works out to average about $300 per 5* character pull. But if you play long enough they give you enough rolls for free that you can at least get a couple of them even with mediocre luck.
"i sold my left kidney for waifu. 12/10 fun game, would sell the other kidney again."
"God, the story needs help. it's so badly written. there are constant universe continuity errors, and so many of the characters are ruined in the narrative. Just give me the kid and stfu. what an awful story that ruins the aesthetic of an ln. game mechanics have gotten better. And everyone is a viable unit if you know how to use them. literally the only saving grace of this game is the waifu/husbando aesthetic but even that fails within its own universe."
Its lots of fun if you can get friends to compete with.üòÜüòÜ
"I didnt have good experiences with the drop chances, but it wasn't anything more than an afterthought as it comes with the territory, but after my phone got replaced I learned that the game has no syncing or cloud storage, you need to register a code. I lost my account, lesser games have this syncing to protect users from this happening. Why cant fate go?"
tidd .
This is grate!
waifu for laifu
a lot of fun to go though missions and events.
"Thou shalt not give in to the gacha. But alas, ephemeral waifu banners make it utterly difficult to resist the temptation."
Great game found out about it from a couple of friends last year
amazing summon rates kinda stuck but it's a great game over all.
"Pretty good game overall. Gatcha rates are punishing, but the story ans charactera are all well fleshed out. Wish it used all of my screen realistate on my Pixel 3 XL tho, or more of it."
Don't play this game if you love money or yourself. Five stars.
This is the most epic game i have ever played plus its fate i like the series and games
"Love the series, love the game."
Works fine but noticeably less smooth than running this on a current iOS device. S9+
"I've been playing for a little over a year, I honestly enjoy the game, haven't had to spend any money and I think I've got a pretty good team, it's about playing the events in their entirety for all the awesome rewards, really helps you move forward. well done, I love Fate."
Amazing and no pay to play required for the full experience.
Waifus galore!
"Great game, god-awful rates."
"Amazing, just wished it didn't get me so involved with using my wallet so much üé∞"
Fate fanboy so I'm definitely biased but hey! Fate for the phone what's not to love. Fun characters. Occasionally pretty goofy story that like any good fate franchise can pull off the switch to serious if it wants and very generous events makes this a fun game. Not the nicest game to Whales but thas not a bad thing.
"Great game. I love the Character interaction and Story, plus there is almost always events going on that allow ease of acces to up grade materials or neat Servants!"
"Time for a 2019 update. I finally bumped the rating up to 4 stars, because they began implementing some of the really important QoL updates (back button, auto burn, etc etc). STORY 2019- gets better in Camelot to Shinjuku arcs; first five singularities just seem like garbage in comparison. GRAPHICS 2019- no improvement. GACHA 2019- still one of the worst systems on any platform; NA is stingier with free currency than JP. OVERALL 2019- fun enough for what it is: a waifu/husbando game with plot"
i hate it
I managed to fix the lag thank you for reminding me to clear the cache so it can run smoother. I definitely recommend the game if your a nerd that likes history and things.
it's a very fun game
"love the game, lost my account and they retrieved it for me! keep up the great work!"
Fate/GO is better than both Pokemon GO and CS:GO But don't buy unless you want to spend too much money on virtual waifus to make them fight other people's less superior waifus. Otherwise 10/10 would reccomend.
pls let us have another gems to summon
"This art is good, the dialogues are nice, the gameplay is great"
EPIC & addictive
historically accurate. waist money on waifus wife took the kids but I got Billy
fun to play always
its lit
"good game, worst gasha rate"
Been playing since release and having a lot of fun
cool guys only
good stuff.
Great characters and story.
Sc√°thach Pretty
"It's great if you lose all expectations when rolling in the Gacha, especially on limited banners."
great game. love for the anime series made me try fgo. recently a lot of crackling sounds. just looked up it's not just me. maybe software issue?
most fun game
The rates are awful but I really enjoy playing it.
Games gr8
love it.
Amazing simply amazing
"The game is awesome but gacha rates are horrible, prepare your wallets."
We walk in this hell
welcome to the rice field
I love gacha hell HAHAHA!!!!!!
just yes
Very good game only gripe about it is the pull rates which are pretty bad but any dedicated player can easily get a ssr
"When most franchises make a mobile game, they wind up creating a simple cash grab with a tenuous link to the primary property. Type Moon on the other hand built a game which stands alongside their previous work as a top tier product. Combining elements from RPG and Visual Novels, Fate Grand Order easily stands as the peer to Fate Stay Night and Fate Extra, as its own title while retaining that Nasu charm we all know and love."
boobies and sexy outfit
get your waifu or die broke
just too low rates man
"I love this game so much, hoping to get more SSR tho"
becoming a master and saving the world. servants with rich backstory and great personality.
umu?!?
Servants are great. Storyline is good. Gacha is salty.üòÇüòÇ
"This game can be very grindy and may feel repetitive at times. Not a game for everyone. Gacha rates also sucks ass. However, it is entirely possible to clear most, if not all the quests as a F2P player. You just need to have a good strategy (just get a max herc friend :D ). Past all that, the gameplay, story and characters are great."
i like it
gacha hell meant to make you cry till you've nothing left. Will play it again 10/10

"My hopes, my dreams, my bank account...I'd do it all over again"
the only phone game I've really been hooked on
prettu nice
"It's a great game that hosts a ton of events, a fun story, and an abundance of unique and interesting characters. However, it is held back by being a gacha based game. They do give out a lot of free currency with every event and maintenance, but the odds of getting a 5* servant are less than 1%. This might deter some players. I've played it since release and still find it enjoyable, but I'd be cautious about spending too much money on this game, for those with gambling issues."
great game. even as a f2p.
I love the game been playing for 2 months already and got my waifu mordred!Its worth playing 5 stars all the way!
The money I spent could have been a 10 day trip in Japan. 10/10 would spend again.
Slow performance on pocophone f1.
I hate this game but i'm still playing it i don't know why hmmmmm ü§î
More waifus DW and more apologems. but its good. 100/10
this silly game destroyed my life i love it
it is great love everything about it
I have just passed the game and it is truly the one game that I have felt was enjoyable. I would like to thank the staff for all if their time and effort that they put into it. I love the heroes that are in it and felt I could achieve it. Thank you for making this game
a great game to pass the time. love the story and the characters
Nice .....
too long to load
it had a very interesting story that really pulled me in and the combat is easy to learn definitely would recommend
JUST BEING AH WEEB
"Your app is bad, you should feel bad. Keep pissing on your players and fans. Seems to be working out real well for you. Note: sarcasm. for my review. Long load times can't see pictures of characters when getting them or during story. Tutorial is really forced and it just led me to waiting for ever to just give me free movement around the game. Two hours was all I needed. I've never given any game I've played this low a rating. Learn from your competitors but it seems like you're late to the game"
it a good game team best
"too much gacha, some battles are straight up impossible even in the early game if you dont have your own 0.00001 percent 5 star servant or you ignore the npc guest servant and get another persons 0.00001 gacha only 5 star servant. to top it all of, the game gives 0 cr@ps whenever you can comple the weekly and daily tasks, in my experiende, i had to defeat 3 archer servants, but there were only 1 or 2 battles with them in the 3 chapters, i even checked the optional quests and there was nothing."
"fun, great story but the fan service can get a bit squicky"
I have played this game for a long time and just the other day I ran into minor issue with the game but one quick message over to the amazing folks on the support team and I was able to get the problem all sorted out within 24-48 hours and the team was amazingly patient and understanding with my horrible communication skills so shout out to them.
"Great overall aside from the gacha rates, which are abysmal. Spend hours and hours grinding just to pull craft essences and a few 3 star servants. Lower your expectations for summons when playing this one. Majorly."
"No player communication, PR department actively avoids player questions. Censored the game despite claiming not to, not giving us the Japanese Experience despite claiming to, not giving out fair and equal treatment compared to other servers. If I could get my money back I would."
"Low drop rates, mediocre game play, great story, amazing servants!"
"I can make type moom earn more money, seriously they are wasting a lot of potential for profit with this game at least in the American sector and also is the most great game but his rate are too high i mean is that's the point but 0.77, well is better to 0.33(don't take ideas type moon)Ôºé"
its a very good game and i love it a lot
amazing. that is all
Great lost my second account because my ID and password was wrong.. why can't you can login with Facebook or Google????? this is really annoying
This is one of the most boring games I ever played
fc on s10+ plz fox thanks
"This game has always been a gem amongst gacha games not only because of its style and gameplay, but also because of its ability to cater to new and returning players with each new event and singularity."
"Great game, probably the most well designed mobile game, gameplay wise. Definitely the most well written one."
Best RPG game so far
Love the Game have been playing for a while keep it up guys!
"Installed and tried launching. Asked what app I wanted to use to complete the action, showing me a bunch of email apps. Restarted device, same problem. Uninstalled/reinstalled, same problem. Might try again later after a few patches. Was kinda looking forward to trying this game..."
PATHETIC game just goes white and stays open in background with NO loading at all
"Good story, enjoyable gameplay and boss fights that can sometimes be brutal but fun. Some may cite the ruthlessness of the game's gacha and it truly can be harsh but the game starts you out with a very solid three star as well as a random SR. With those two and the right combination of one-three stars you'll find that you can do pretty well even without the greatest selection of SR and SSR characters."
Its my first gacha game and probably the last
Very well developed game all in all.
5/5 gave me Okita two times within 5 10-rolls and Hijikata on the first 10-roll in his banner but pls donate me mats.
Voice lines sound muted half of the times after the latest Android updates on my Note 9. Please fix it.
"Great game play, definitely not a Pay to win game, its soooo worth it ‚ô•"
great game I have been enjoying the story and events as well as the gameplay.
"Love the game and the way they connect the battles and storyline. I did have one issue with my account, but the support team was very quick and helpful in resolving it. One of the best mobile games imo!"
"Have had this downloaded for a week but every time I try to open it, it directs me to email and an error. I see other similar reviews. Kind of crazy this problem is still persisting for so long"
dang it doesnt work it just keeping on closing and redirecting me to my email then please developers help me fix this i already sent the email you made to me ill give you 5 stars if it gets fixed
Best game ever! Best gatcha hell ever!
"The gameplay is alright, it utilizes the Criware engine and will look and play similar to other games which have also utilized it. If you have played the PSP version of Persona 3 (highly recommend), you will probably notice some similarities. The devs boast millions of words of 'rich storytelling', but the translation is plagued with misspellings, typos, and general syntax errors, detracting from the storytelling itself. This company needs to hire some coherent english speakers and proofread"
"You could play all day and only get halfway to a summon because it takes so long to get one quarts let alone thirty of them to summon once, buying them is a bad idea because no matter how much you buy it feels like the pull rate for who ever you want just shrinks along with your wallet, pull rates are all messed up, your never guaranteed anything good no matter how many times you pull."
A 475MB update and suggests wifi which takes hours AND does not update in background.
"I play the Japanese version of the game and it is absolutely amazing. But I'm writing this review to call out the NA team on their censoring the art and lore of a servant just because they think it can be ""offensive"". That is absolutely unacceptable. And the fact they avoided addressing that change publicly simply shows their cowardice and incompetence. Don't drop money on this and play the Japanese version instead. The NA team cannot be trusted and are not deserving of your support."
A great way to kill time.
this game is so boring. why isnt their a moba gate game?
Great game! I can see a lot of efforts poured into it
Unplayable
right now can not play same as seth error n tell me to erase cach and i deleted n install again n nothing
Fate Grind Order I regret making an alt.
"Unlimited Credit Card Works. The only game moble, console or PC that has made me a degenerate willing to spend over 1000 dollars. Rate up is a lie. Run while you can, go play Azure Lane or something. You can only be a free-to-play for so long in this game. HELP ME!!!!"
10/10 waifu heaven
Good game if you enjoy the Fate series
Can I now play the game if my phone has a custom ROM? Is the only reason why I can't play this game and it's stupid and bodersome.
"its a waifu game with some solid guys, patience in grinding leads to a more pleasurable experience. good luck in camelot"
"The gacha rates are the stingiest I've seen, aling with the promotional rewards, communication with the playerbase is terrible, future censorship is worrisome, and the gameplay is average at best. The only saving grace is the story and characters"
"I wish there was less loading, these are 2D sprites HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE TO LOAD!? other than that it's a great game."
when I start the tutorial it let's me do two of the tutorial but then won't let me finish it at all I love the series it's kinda saddening that I can't play it please fix it
this games audio is really bad sadly and the graphics make me nauseous. I really wanted to like this but it's just so physically enraging that I just cant play it.
A fun game for everyone to play based on the anime. Fate GO is a much different story than the ones I've seen before. Masters get more than one servant for one thing in this game and if your characters lose unlike the anime they come back. You should definitely download this game for fans and even people who never heard of it may still like it so try it out it's free lol.
this is good game
"Battle Mechanics, Story, and Music are great, but drop rates, both for certain materials as well as Gacha Rates, are horrible. Events can fix the issue with Materials, but Gacha Rates make it nigh impossible to get Gold Servants, which sucks since aside from missable Welfares, the only other methods of getting Gold Servants is through the nearly unusable Unregistered Spirit Origin system due to the insane conditions required to get one let alone 10 for a single 5-Star. If that feature specifically was less tedious, I'd gladly give this game 5 Stars, as everything else in it is deserving of a perfect rating."
Ready your wallets every event.
Fun game based on the anime all of my favorite characters as well as new ones makes up a great story. As a fan or not I would definitely download this game You may like it.
The game wont connect for some reason and all the progress i had the last 2 to 3 months were deleted
"This game is not for the faint of heart. I love fate, so this was up my alley, but be warned. This game will RNG you into the shadow realm, and get used to not getting cool characters without a pretty penny. other than that, it's a fun game."
"Keeps crashing, it doesn't get me anywhere to play this game if this problem continues always. Please fix this!"
Eat my dragon balls
"Great story, and many, many loveable characters make up for the gross SSR gacha rates. I've been playing this for a little over a year now and still love it. vowed not to spend originaly, but did so anyway lol you also do not need ssr to clear content. it's a lot more fun that way for many players. however ssr units make it much easier. you especially want the support casters (Waver, Merlin, Tamamo, Hans, and skadi when shes put in) only warning- be ready for the grind and bad ssr drop rates"
"Had phone on towers with service, but would not but blink before it crashed. It is altogether unrunnable."
not addictive at all
make more fate series/ more shows
"Installation takes a million years to update, so if you have that much to spare. Go for it"
very good game.5* is very easy toget it
"I used to play this game all the time and I had a pretty good team on here. Until I had to transfer my game temporarily on my tablet,and then back to another phone I had the code for data transfer and unfortunately it keeps saying its already in use and I cant get my old account back. I tried everything I really wish that they would just use Google , Facebook, or Twitter for data transfer instead of codes..."
The BEST gacha game ever!
Not working. :(
Phenomenal!
A great game based on the anime has a great story mode characters and events. A fun game that I recommend downloading.
best EVER!!!
A great game fun for all ages great story and characters. A great rpg that teaches team work and patience. A colorful background with beautiful works of art and music. This game passes time quick and makes it more fun with my favorites you should definitely download this game.
I give it 3 stars at best. everything was good until I couldn't get back into the game after the level 5. but besides that everything was good about the game and other stuff
not a bad game. great graphics and im a huge fan of fate zero and not the rest so I can appreciate them using the characters.
Astolfo best grill
well i got alturia with my bad luck so dis game 10/10
"Game is meh at best. Hard to believe it's popular with how many problems there are. Firstly the game doesn't give you near enough energy to get anything done. Secondly early game stages cost too much energy, seriously needs to be halved. No reliable way to level up servants, need cards to do that but late teens levels require more and the cards don't give nearly enough. The gacha components need tuned, need to separate banners for servants and the other components."
i've seen my cousin play this game and then downloaded it and this is a very nice game...
"Great game, love collecting and training my servants in each stage. The only downside I could think is the way to save your account. Pass code only, no way to save it through Facebook or any other accounts."
horrible rates -salty
"Quite honestly one of my favorite mobile games to play, if not my favorite. Mostly for one simple reason, it has a story and a GOOD one!"
I love the anime and this game. I just wish I got some new servants once in a while.. but other than that I love the game!
"This game tends to have very long loading times and lags quite often. Even in battle. I've cleared my cache a few times, I've cleared out some apps I don't use anymore either. This game just doesn't play smoothly for me and I don't know if it does for others, but I wish this would be fixed. Edit: Now the game doesn't open after I started using my phone's personal game mode. Wonderful. Enjoy your new 1 star review from me."
"good game, great story, and a lot of salt :v"
so cooooool
"i love fate series and i spend money as well for this once but am not a whaler thou and although you will not always get what you want since this is a gatcha, but if you get even a *4 it will feel amazing, it has a rich roster of memorable character even the lower star servant is special in my heart i recommend this for fate funs and other people who want to be a master and commanding historical figures."
"Why can't I access the game, when I reload and enter the game, I will be released"
prettygud
Fate Grand Order is a great game based on the anime. It has alot of my favorite characters great story mode and events. l definitely recommend downloading this game for fans of the show and rpg lovers.
Just another grinding simulator with bland gameplay and pretty jpegs.
"You could recommend this 100%, but for offline players, like me, it'd still do, because game is so addicting, try to reduce the time you play because if you don't, you'd probably forget to do your assignment."
Great game love the story and lots of fun definitely recommend downloading game. If you're into role-playing games this ones for you.
"love,love,LOVE this game! the story,gameplay,events and characters are all amazing and epic. Quick question though,is there a problem with the voice lines right now? it's very slow to appear when you tap your current fave character in My Room at times and there are no translations for some lines"
I can't barely even play the game as all it does when i try to play is send me to my homescreen I don't know why please help
"Great game! Fun, just difficult enough and keeps your attention. Has in game purchase items like most but it's not over the top so that you have to buy stuff to win."
"reported for false advertising,  The localizers are on public record as stating they would not censor the game."
The reason why this is a 1 star instead of the 4 star that I had it at last time is because of the (Cosplay) Emiya problem. DW aren't going back on their promise that they made 2 years ago.
you can't save your Data
VERY NAISU!!!
addicted and cant stop. great game for a great franchise
"Attempted to install in run on two identical phones, save one's presence of service and data. Only that one would load and run, yet the other, after some prodding nigh 30 minutes, returned an unfailing error code 43. When this program only works on phones running towers, this is an absolute scam and sham. This exclusivist protoco is undeniably discriminatory and unfair towards certain roles and confuses security with connectivity."
Couldn't even play. App doesn't start correctly.
"Terrible gacha rates for 5*Servants, ungenerous game compared to other gacha games. Stagnant gameplay, roundabout level-up system and unvoiced story/events. Soundtrack is decent, art is inconsistent (some are very beautiful, others not so much). Considering how long the game has been out in JP and how much money they are making, you'd expect these things to improve, but they're not. It's still good fanservice for Fate fans as it's always nice to see new Servants."
Very laggy.
Depends
Failed to open and caused Game Launcher to crash.
Actually an amazing game everyone here is saying that it's hard to get the gacha currencies but if you save for awhile you can get 120 in a month if you haven't completed the story and the censoring was good if you saw the background
Finally got a phone that can run it. Great game.
"Censorsing a servant because someone has a problem with him doesn't give them a right to outright change him. I won't be staying here anymore longer if there is more censorship or they don't fix him, I'll take my money and go to JP. To the people who actually cares about emiya alter please contact JP team and tell them what is happening on NA server since NA team doesn't want to listen to us and ignore their fans, maybe then they'll start to listen once JP gets invovled."
its grate
The game won't start after installing. It opens the share menu whenever I try to start it
"great game story and characters, I highly recommend downloading and playing this one."
"Fast paced, grindy but fun and easy to grasp the combat."
I played this on my zenfone max before and now on my note 9. This Game runs well regardless. Kudos to the developers.
"Good visuals / etc. But the game is not tied to your google account. So if you uninstall the application, you start from scratch."
Best game I have found on the play store.
can't connect even though i have excellent WiFi network
"Good game, but hard to get back into. However... Downgraded my review oeing to abysmal loading times for Australisn players as well as recent issues eherein the game refuses to load properly. Also adding in the deletion of progress dats from previous efforts as a serious flaw which amounts to a ripoff for players!"
it is really fun
how to adjust the setting to prevent screen auto off? it's annoying when reading the dialogues and the screen goes off. thanks
Finally got SSR Okita Souji my first 5 Star
gudako stole my wallet
great game but i wish the drop for duplicate change keep gettin hero even when i max the Noble phantam
Game didnt run and i had to look up to see that it doesnt work AT ALL if USB debugging is turned on
Gacha is evil civilization
"Game works if you are not in debug mode. Theres lengthy text and very short amounts if gameplay within the start of the game. It's weird how one of the advertising screenshot boasts about it having thousonds of words...i mean, i guess its a visual novel. Will update once more is played."
tamamo <3
great time killer but also a money killer
I love this it's great but the biggest downside is on how to login/recover your old account why don't use gmail account? its really frustrating that I cannot play my old acc I played this game almost a year and since moment you need to free up some space you need to uninstall it. if you want to play ur old acc it's going to be hassle.
lost my account
I'll be frank the gacha in the game is a headache because the most you can expect is a 3-star servant. And what I think sucks is that when there is a increased drop-off rate other servants drop-off rate decreases. It really can anger people who work their butts of getting saint quartz. not to mention you need 5 of the same 5-star character to get the materials to be able to summon a 5-star in the shop. Other than that I think the game is great I love its gameplay and their story's and events.
Absolutely punishing gacha rates and awful prices. Even as a huge fan of fate I cannot recommend this game.
its not working for my tablet. It closes after i open it.
"I'm on Galaxy S9+, and this will not run... Uhm...."
i cant even play the game for some reason
"Story is cool, gameplay is interesting. However, the app loading time throughout the game is ridiculous. It is so frustrating and slow. Because of this, sometimes it doesnt even start up. I dont have the patience for this so I'm uninstalling. I may come back to it someday if they fix this."
didnt launch. almost broke my phone. I wish I didnt sound like a bot.
"This game is great, characters story and the BGM is awesome, you need to deepen the bond of a characters to unlock the dialogue, each characters has connections on one another you will unlock the dialogue if you have the corresponding character. Many people don't like this game because of the gacha, at least here you can use the lower tier hero in the endgame not like other gacha game, you just need to be patient and have a little bit of luck to get the character that you want."
"didn't have enough beginners boost (i.e saint quartz, tickets etc.) drop rates for servants ""up"" never had any 4 star servant while spending 90 saint quartz which is hard to get because mission rewards only give you 1 saint quartz for the whole mission which requires a whole lot of ap, for beginners like myself I didn't find this entertaining at all spending time to work for just 1 saint quartz spending all of those resources just to get the thing I wanted."
JUST GIVE THE NEW PLAYERS A REASON TO PLAY WITH THEIR FIRST SSR. For God sake.
itdoesntwork
its a very fun game
Its a good game with a great story and interesting characters. This would be a great gatcha if it weren't for the unfair and scummy summoning system which barely gives you anything. Improve the summoning and it gets 5 stars.
only need to improve the controls
"Gameplay and story are fine, and the characters are well designed. However the gacha system is so unforgiving, as it is almost impossible to get any gold servants even in 30 quartz roll, requiring you to spend more money in the game. Overall I like the game."
pls update for poco f1
"Terrible drop rates, I know i spent alot in a short period trying to get a certain card. Lost my game after backup and trying to move account. Wasnt pleased by the hassle and moved on. Eventually found my gacha home in granblue fantasy which I like better. To each his own"
the game is amazing great story great chatacter development but the only two problems that stop this game from being a 5 star is the gacha system and the saint quartz drops When being on the gacha system the chances of getting the character you want or need is extremely slim Saint quartz drops make me want to stop playing anyone can spend from 15 mins to an 1 hour and get very few drops just getting 1 saint quartz for spending 15 minutes on one level if anything these two things need improvement
This game is amazing 5 outta 5 stars it mixes with a good storyline and some awesome characters!.....but can you pls make the other things in the game offline so i can play on the go.
"generic garbage gacha game. if you like looking at anime girls with big gazongas and pretending its a ""groundbreaking RPG"", sure... but no."
"The only thing I have problems with about this is the fact that it continually crashes. Now, in battles, that's not a big deal. It's during the dialogue when it causes problems, because then you have to see the whole thing again. Other than that, great game"
"Honestly the only gatcha game I have played that doesn't limit you with how much you can progress while not paying. The AP growth rate is nice and regular events keep me invested! Love this game, it's been on my phone for almost 3 years now!"
"Can you guys like update the select support screen every before battle? Like ther are two categories, first for non-friends and the second for your friends. Such a pain in the ass to keep on refreshing until you get the friend support servant you need."
get to meet all kind if fishes in the sea
This game is great for Fate lovers. You get to build your dream team of characters and even make them stronger and evolve. Pretty darn cool üòä
Get rid of the AP and just let people play... This has to be one of the most unbalanced games I have ever played. Reinforcing the rule that mobile games are cancer...
"I love the over all story of the game an the drop system is really good. But it not worth putting money into. The summon is just not worth it. 10x summon fills like it was just thrown to get in a rush without proper planning, and you have a better chance at getting new craft essances and servents on one pull."
"A great game based on a awesome anime and history telling for the ones that didn't go to history class lol. Great story and alot of my favorite characters, if you like rpg games and Fights then fans and even if you never heard of the anime I would still download."
Support Android Q please. The game wont run under Android Q.
It is my crack
I love this game!! They help recover my account. Best customer support out there!
"Rates on pulling servants VS unusable cards are utterly ridiculous, you're only SOMETIMES rewarded if you spend a whole paycheck trying to pull useful characters, SERVANT SUMMON RATES ARE ABYSMAL AND SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ALTERED the rates are FAR too low to justify how much it actually costs to get something useful, it's outrageous that you can spend money in game and get absolutely nothing of use to show for it smh."
Huge fan of the anime and this game you should definitely download. It has a great story plus some of my favorite characters.
A great game based on a awesome anime. It has a great story alot of my favorite characters and the gameplay is awesome. I highly recommend downloading this game for everyone.
Great game fun to play great characters.
"tech support is very slow. tryig to reclaim account before event ends, but guess not"
rate up is a lie -_-
"Very fun turn based game. Not too complex but has a variety of mechanics to learn about. In the long run research has really helped, especially with future servants and events and it's not to say it is required but it's very very helpful if you want to achieve the best. The only issues I have with the game are you can't go back if you press ""Attack"", you have to restart the app to use skills if you forget or misclick, gacha can be brutal, too many lollies and Karna hasn't got another version yet."
SSR is very hard to get. Stories are fun to read.
"The game overall has a great game mechanics and one of the best story i have ever read, even if there are some issues like minor bugs. overall the game gives off a warming feel of a fate game."
Very addicted and role play.
"also known as GATCHA HELL. cant roll any units you want? easy, just buy an account LOL. its not like they fix the game anyways."
Gacha makes it unplayable unless you're rich. My waifu Saber deserves better.
"Damn it man, cut off weed!!!!!"
Game will not load.
Excellent customer support! Great game and plot! I love the characters and the story!
Doesn't launch at all.
"the game instantly crashes when i try to start it, idk what to do, no one else has this issue. I'm on a Galaxy note 9 if that helps..."
The story is awesome so are the characters based on the great anime show fun for anyone highly recommend downloading this game.
"i can't download the game,, saw it say ""installing"" then went back to ""downloading"" the app smh"
love all the characters and the dialogue
Other term for hell.
i like it truly
Love the anime and this game great story and characters. Lots to do if you're looking for a game that cost time this is it. For fans and even people who never heard of the anime still will enjoy this game.
"It is one of the best RPG'S I've seen to date, not only are Noble Phantasms fun to use, they're also one of the most important part of the game, and I love it."
Great game fun to play awesome story great characters and wastes alot of time highly recommend download and play this game.
"It's pretty fun and it has my favorites on here, I really wished that there was a date them but some of the options can make them blush so I guess maybe that's good enough for me to pretend with my favorite Fate character. Edit: I disapprove of censorship mostly because they said they wouldn‚Äôt and then did it with no acknowledgement."
it's a fun game to chill and play.
started watching the show and am liking it quite a bit so tried to play the game i have seen countless times but never download the day came to finally try it and the game wont even open lol galaxy s9+ should not have a problem and a game thats been out this long should not have this problem shame seems like a cool game
this game is actually trash no good way to get good characters and its way too difficult to get star quarts at the start too much commitment for a game that has little return
worst pulls ever... I'm done.
How do I recover lost data from uninstalling? can someone help? desperate here
I love it. the hatred and anger and self loathing it gives me is wonderful
"over all fun to play, even if you're a F2P player the game is still kinda fun story wise, granted the low drop rate for characters are a bit annoying and can be a pain but I think the game atleast makes it possible to power up weaker units to semi make em viable, tho one recent issue is lately after the new Update there seems to be a bug where the Sound effects and Voices are disabled and only the BG music plays, which while not terrible really kinda ruins the mood"
Great show awesome game and amazing story fun for all ages and fans and even people that never heard of the show alike.
censorship
this game has taken over my life....... only game i am willing to spend money on
Why censor Emiya Alter? I thought they said they won't censor any character
Is there any way to save the director?
3 words.....pay to win
won't open for me at all.
we e
garbage
OSHA ondynf OMG that is so now
great game fun and passes the time plus great story.
"Game is amazing for any fan of the Fate franchise and quite addicting. However, this game is not friendly on your wallet if one does not exercise restraint. Rolling for the high level cards depends if luck is on your side so hope for the best."
censored game
U j
love life
favorite game
addictive and fun
"Best Story, Best characters, Soul Crushing Gacha"
Keeps on crashing when i open it
addicting to anyone
"Don't get me wrong, it's a very cool game with a great story and an amazing art style. The only thing I hate is relying on other players for support in your own team. If you have lots of friends who play the game too then that's cool, but if you're like me and loathe interacting with people you don't know, that feature really sucks. I just want to summon beings, form my own team, and go. I don't want to borrow someone else's character for support even if its temporary."
mixicardpsnplüêû
one of the best games at stealing your money
love it i will die for it
USB debugging has to be disabled. Why exactly?
the bestüòÇüòÇüòÇ
great games awesome story.
"Battle system is slow and boring, not a good thing with the amount of grinding you need to do though. The real killer is the summon rates though. 1% rates for five star servants and pulls mixed with craft essences, done this way to feint compliance with JOGA guidelines."
fun but a lot of grinding
"I love it, Wish there was an Xbox version!!"
didnt even launch.
"Drop rates are horrible. Worst out of any gacha game. Ive spent over 1000 sq, the equivalent of hundreds of dollars, and only ended up with ONE five star. This game is ridiculously grinding oriented. Half the events are just for grinding more garbage to enhance your heroes with. The main story is a little repetitive. They always have you as the underdog against stronger enemies. Interesting and detailed characters and the silly events are the best part of this game. I like the combat system too."
Just wasting time
fun has loads of levels. i love watching the anime and play the game
"I used my transfer code and wasn't able to continue where I was left off and I only used it once, pleased fix it where it can be used more than one time"
"Good strategy and tactics variability, but RNG reliant core gameplay hampers it. Grindfest without auto AI to help you through it, with very scarce rewards on top of that. Stale and unbalanced meta, with only buster being good, quick being mediocre and arts being downright bad. Abysmal gacha rates. Great dialouges, story and characters. Conclusion: Great story and characters being let down by shoddy gameplay and lazy development. 3/5 at best. Wouldn't recommend to non-whales."
"It is fun for a bit but this is without a doubt one of, if not THE, biggest cash grab mobile games. The drop rates, even with the special events are actually TERRIBLE, and it takes at LEAST 2 weeks to get enough gems (or whatever they are called) to get a free 10 pull even if you are playing every day as often as the game lets you. Honestly, I recommend Fire Emblem Heroes over this game. the drop rates are better, the game is more fun, and its easier to get free pulls than this game."
"Been a NA player since day 1, just want to share some opinions/advices for this game: Do not play this game if you have enough gambling addiction and not enough income. Do not love this game if the authentic JP experience is more important to you than minor censorships. Do not lose your daily login streak and miss your weekly quests if you want more free rolls for gacha. Do not forget putting your Servants and Craft Essence in your support list or I'll kick your ass with my Cu Chulainn."
Add translations/English subtitles to Da Vinci's dialogues in Enhance/Shop pls
"Great app, though the gacha rates are pretty bad, the gameplay is amazing and you can get by just fine with the free characters. Also has a great story (1 or 2 mediocre at worst) and great character design. I'm usually pretty stingy when it comes to money, but I'd be willing to spend money on this game."
"Game's been censored with no announcement or explanation, despite the localization producer promising no censorship. Why, who made the decision, will it happen again? Who knows, they didn't even let a journalist ask about it."
freezes all the time
I love this game but since the last update the occasionally freeze please fix it
i have the best time with this game
we need a way to back out of attack menu mane
i love it!!!
If you have a gambling problem Play This Game.
Awesomes
Love the franchise but this is designed solely for the sake of milking money out of you. Google a FGO roll simulator and see how much time and money it takes to summon your favorite character.
just read the story online. no reason to play this glorified gambling game.
"After reading the reviews the only complaints I'm seeing is from perverted losers that lost animated porn. Cheer up, There's a PSVR game that lets you have alone time with one of your fake girlfriends."
Very slow in my phone (I didn't have the problem with other games of the genre). Also art is not attractive.
"I hate it!! It needs a lot of space!! If you reduce the space needed, I'd give this 4 stars. Not 5 cause it updates A LOT."
super slow game play. game game is also weak.
I am unable to launch the game. Error 61 and a white screen. I am on an unrooted Note 9 with Stock FW. I really wanted to see Billy the Kid shoot dragons and werewolves and this is a big letdown.
good civ
its very addicting
help bugs forces email app to open. will check forums but ho
It's fantastic! Just beware of gacha!
No play with root or even with developer options. Stupid decision. Azur Lane is a better game anyway.
"Great story and the you really need to strategize in boss battles to win. Events give you free servants and farm material. You don't actually need to spend monies in this game, just add a few whales to help you clear the story. Edit: 600 plus days into the game, need to say much more?"
"The gacha is vicious, but the girls are cute and the game is fun. Better if you have pre-existing fate knowledge."
"The best Gacha Game of all time, and still is. But still note that it is still a gacha, so please spend responsibly."
goog
A fun mobile game for anyone who's a fan of the Fate series/universe.
One of the most prominent games out there. Played it since the launch in 2017 and still playing it since.

"I love the Fate franchise and the fact that they translated the game for us. The story is great but honestly the servants are the main reason for getting into the game. Unfortunately they've started censoring the servants which I take as a terrible sign of things to come. To make matters worse, this is exactly what they promised wouldn't happen and they're refusing to even acknowledge it. I'll probably stop sinking any money into this game if the best part of it is going to go down hill."
loved it thanks üòò
beautiful ‚ô° fun and great to pass the time though loading screens take a while.... but a great game overall ~
Its a good complicated game but once you understand how everything works. Its a fun non-repetitive game. (You will be salty though.)
"This is a fun game with a major drawback. The gacha system is the worst and most unbalanced system I've ever experienced. Servents and crafts are summoned from the same thing. So if you plan on summoning servents, be prepared to not even get them. The only way to guarantee that you summon a servents is to do the 10 pull for 30 saint quartz which if free to play is not easy or quick to aquire. Not only that, but the rates are terrible. In over a month of play I've aquired 1 4* servent and no 5* I've even paid money and got nothing to show for. I know I can't blame anybody but myself for that but it's extremely demoralizing. I'm a big fate fan and alot of the cooler more known and captivating characters are 5* cards that you're chances of pulling are near impossible. Because of this I'm left extremely disappointed in this game and can not recommend it to anyone. Sadly the game is good, but the gacha system is horrible."
"its ridiculous. But its a straight male's game!! its all girls characters!!! on screen, on shop, on home, on tutorial, on cut scenes and most scenarios, on 99% of events, everything!! and when it comes to male characters they barely exist and when they do, they look eh okay!! meh"
"like the game great graphics,great story as well.. one problem i have is the summoning which is hard to summon on banners other than that 5*"
"I'm confused with how this game has reached the level of popularity that it has. the visuals are choppy and low quality, the story is boring and lord almighty is the combat so freaking booooring!"
Fate waifus what can I say? btw the saint quartz system is terrible.
"slow slow slow"""
10/10 would burn through my savings to get a single ssr again
"Game is still fun, but i would recommend anyone who doesnt support censorship to not spend a dime on the game. NA localization has been mixed over the years but I do not support the western washing of products enjoy."
"it's real good, something I look forward to in the day when my energy is full"
Crash on Boot. on LG Q7 plus.
salt mines
Enjoyable!
Every character looks like the have been copied and pasted. And just another collecting and spending game like the rest
i really love fgo ‚ù§
pretty good and very well for people who are fans of the FATE series
I missed the entire darn Valentine event because that update did nothing but forced my phone to restart every time I tried to update. Then the Feb 22nd patch came and I fi-freaking-nally logged in after a half month. Barely playing a few days and this idiot patch kicks me back to the restart loop again. What bugs this patch fixes? The patch itself is a freaking bug!!
"Cool game, but after finishing the story and doing all the things for half a year and only a single 5star character. Sorry but chances of getting a 5star here is rarer than FeH and FFBE. I dont think theyll fix it."
"Beautiful art, soundtrack‚ô•Ô∏è Pretty good story ‚≠ê gameplay!"
"why is this app asking you to agree to the collection of your personal information such as contacts, email addresses, etc. I disagreed with that and now I'm uninstalling this app."
Easy play nc
Since my fiance has gotten me into fate again I've giving this app a edit of my review so its getting a 5/5 stars
"Pretty fun game, I basically added friends that are level 100 and up to carry me during missions and it helped a lot."
pretty good game. just dont like the load times
"You know what? the games gacha is a total hell and guarantees are basically a lie, the 10x summon is also a complete joke since CEs cuck your chances, i mean CEs could have their own mini gacha.....Gameplay wise though the game is superb, graphic? compared to Epic7 and other gachas Id say kinda meh though."
Guaranteed best Gacha game on the app store
Very Fun especially the Gacha Part of the Game where you get the servants
"I love the game but the loading screens take a long time, and my game crashes from time to time. Other then that amazing game (drop rates for materials are terrible tho, we need increase material drop rates)."
"I used to rate this game very highly, however the NA team began editing character art to avoid hurting fragile western sensibilities despite promising their players they would never do this. After becoming a success by taking our money for over a year, and they refuse to acknowledge this issue puboicly. The slippery slope has been engaged. Do NOT trust this team. They don't intend to deliver you the genuine experience. They're going to swindle you to please the PC zealots."
yeahhhhhh
Please DW be generous for SQs :(
Great game if you dont mind trading ur soul for RNG
please kill me
Amazing.
The potential for cheap to play is good civilization.
was somewhat good until my phone arbitrarily deleted the app and now i can't reclaim my account rip Jalter
i doesn't load at all for me would give it a zero ill change it when it does load!!>:(
I Love it
i enjoy the game and once u get ur servants right everything else plays in ao easily and have a real since of accomplishment.
"Gacha game, waifu collector simulator, a great story, fun events and many more. I will never stop loving this game."
dope game
"it loads slower than my grandmother! Game is alright though, could have given a zero"
Love the series as a whole and i love this game just as much. 10/10
I got this game for Astolfo.
"Just keeps crashing. Error 43. Usb debugging already off and dev options on, but still crashes on start up. pocof1 phone not rooted, just unlocked. Really want to play this game. sigh"
I enjoy playing the game.

GACHA RUINED MY LIFE :<
"The English server has long struggled with delays and missing quartz rewards, but now they've moved to actively censoring character art. There's been no communication or transparency or talk of compensation; they're just hoping outrage will die down. But I can't recommend a duplicitous product with a poor translation."
"It's a good game and a good time sink if you want to do nothing but grind. On the other hand, the gacha rates suck. You'll be swimming in garbage craft essences before you get anything decent. I don't recommend playing if you fall easy into gambling. And even if you have the money, good luck."
a great game let down by its sub par chances of getting what you want out of a gatcha.
its cool
"There was absolutely no reason for you to censor Emiya Alter at all. No one had a problem with him until you guys made it a problem. Also, the fact you guys are now doing the radio silence tactic just shows that you acknowledge you messed up. Address the issue like a proper NA team and stop being cowards."
"Game is very fun if you understand that this is a wiafu/husbando battle story sim gacha game. With emphasis on the gacha part. You can play this game 100% free to play but, it does it's best to convince you to pay for quartz as often as it can. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy the game."
its good but needs a way to skip the tatroial it takes to long to go through it or have some way of refuring to it later. it forces u to do it. should have a choice.
Gacha! GACHA!! GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHAA!!!
great succses good game
lost all progress due to a acidental uninstal progress MUST BE CONECTED TO A GOOGLE PLAY ACOUNT all i want back is my mordred... edit recovered accpubt
"The game itself is solid, its main problem is the punishing gacha system it has."
Fun game. Atrocious gacha.
"Wonderfully made game,addicting, exciting and interesting"
blah
"The story of an unqualified narcoleptic sent back in time by a dark-ops team of wizards to set history right with the aid of anime-ized historical figures sounds fascinating. And it is, but the story is the only fascinating thing about it, because the game itself is awful. It is excruciatingly dull and repetitive farming for resources that do not give themselves up easily combined with a punishingly stingy gacha system. Stay far away."
love it and everything fate
this is amazing
"Personally I think the game is amazing and if you play your SQ right getting what you want without paying also works out, though this game has a strong pay drive the farther you get rng farming will catch you regardless if you want to acend your servants, my favorite part of the game is that it doesn't require that you use just gold tier characters because you can use low tier bronze characters too since the characters are all useful in their own way...except anja or whoever from friend summon"
Love this 5
Extremely addictive and its even better for long time fate fans
Censorship is unacceptable.
"They removed a black character from the game because the people in charge of the translation are racist Its 2019, I mean come on"
"The summon chances are a joke, you cant progress without spending which takes a lot of the fun out of it."
Going months without a five star just to get the same one you got at the start again on a paid guaranteed five star Summon :(
It's an OK game but don't try to get all of your waifus too early in the game unless you want to kill your wallet.
Good game but hard to get 5* servants unless super lucky or buy quarts.
good story likeable characters
In love with characters in this game...This needs an full anime!
"The game runs very smoothly and is overall quite entertaining, some matches can prove to be very difficult while some are a breeze especially later game but I find myself always enjoying enhancing my favorite servants and building better teams. My only flaw with the game would be how expensive it is for Crystal's, but it does make attaining 30 by grinding for a new summons more special"
"For my first mobile.gacha game, it has suprisingly good story. while it may not have live3d animations, the extensive amoun of characters prove satisying by themselves."
Years and years I've waited and now it's here! I love Fate series and I love how there are extra class servants. üíï Thank you for making my fantasy into reality. Love the game and the graphics plus the story in every singularity/missions. üòçüòçüòç The only thing I'm concern about is that it takes about 5 to 8 seconds before the battle begins even though I have highspeed internet. Overall it's good. I hope that I get Avenger Edmond Dant√®s. I wasn't able to participate on his Revival. Wait and Hope.
I have always loved the Fate series
"game locks out event content (limited time), do to not having the story competely finished (and its stupid long at theis point). pull rates in the game is garbage, like half a year with no decent pulls garbage lol."
Nice game. I love this new Nintendo app hope Nintendo does more games like this. Good job Nintendo.
"love the anime and i love this game it introduces all the classic history and myths surounding famous peaple like jack the ripper, cu caliunn, king arthur, and blackbeard aja edward teach, and adds nice twists like franis drake being a woman."
I love fate/
Love Type/Moon and the lore.
"I am a fan of the Fate animes, and I really like the game as well. I question some of the character classes but appreciate the creativity behind them."
Horrible censorship for no reason
An addicting game with many waifus and traps... As well husbandos if you're female.
Gacha hell at it's finest.
One of the best games ever long live Senpai haha
one of the best gatcha game ! f2p all servants can used in different lvl .. nice app worth for 5 star i hope they give more quartz for us f2p players to roll 5 star or 4 star servants ! nice app <3
it's good
I actually like this game since I love the series.
FGO experience: - Start Game - See a bunch of waifus and badasses - Goes to summon x10 - Gets crappy servants and cards - Sees summon rate of favorite servants - Sacrifice your wallet to the RNG gods and pray - Grind until you go crazy - Cry in the corner .Best Mobile Game ever
"its got a great story and fun gameplay, the only mobile game i play"
Great story. Looking forward to more
a game were you get your best waifus
"üòçüòçüòç I like everything about this game, FU haters"
üëçüëç
The latest chapter's ice b@tchin~!
too much ce
waifuuu
Has greater history value than my history teacher. I've learn every aspect of history of british empire to rome without FGO. I couldn't pass my history exam if weren't to FGO. I never thought i can answer all my quizes in my school with FGO. FGO help me graduate thanks to this game. Life changing game 10/10 Play this game bois
Historical waifu
need some quest that increase our luck lv when DW?
Please revert the censorship this is a very dangerous road your treading this censorship will only please the people who DON'T play your game!
i love it to bits... just dont get addicted to the gatcha
Got 8 SSR and 1 KScope on a 10 roll
i want 5ssr plsss
Superb game.
"I didn't choose the gacha life, the gacha life chose me."
Boi this gamE iS The Best
"I love this game, very interesting and addicting to play."
Gacha is bad civilization but the game is fun other than that.
Devs WILL NOT hesitate to censor content that the Japanese creators put so much effort into
gacha ruined my life. Nero is best girl umu
"Decent game that is 2 years behind JP version. Lacks content, can be a bit boring at times."
"This is a story/character driven ap. The gameplay is a bit wanting, but most of the content is steamrollable if you understand the logic of most ftp games."
I quite enjoy this especialy since I enjoy the fate series as a whole.
"Great story, beautiful art, acceptable gameplay and it's Fate. What's not to like? (except the horrible gacha rate,that is)"
Awesome games for fate fans. if you love the rpg and the fate series then i recommend on playing it.
Disappointed to see Aniplex actually censoring the game. Making a character's skin tone lighter is never the answer.
good for a free game.
game rate nh∆∞ l ƒë·ª£i l√∫c b√†o ecchan th√†nh welfare to cho 2*
I'm a free to play player and I feel satisfied with the draws I've gotten from the gotcha.
"Fantastic game. Good story, free to play friendly, the only Gacha game out there worth playing."
"Game is good, but the chance to get an SSR servant when you're only an F2P player sucks bigtime."
perfect waifu/ husbando simulator
Amazing game.. Best gacha game ever.. Story and characters are also the best.. Highly recommended for everyone..
Do not pay for this game! Censorship is never okay! RIP Pucci Alter. Hamster-boy doesn't deserve a cent for this insultingly stupid decision. Please do not support censored games by fat shinjis with no respect for the source material. Play JP instead.
I like fgo Amazing!
I absolutely love this game. Decent gameplay with an amazing story.
I love the Fate series as a whole and this game is a great RPG style strategy game. I wish the rate of the gacha was better though. This game is pretty overpriced to play compared to other similar type of gacha out there. It is free to play but to get the better servants and make them stronger they demand and ask too much in costs to their player base I feel. On average it can take like $400 to pull x1 5* servant. That's just ludicrous and unfair cost.
Rate-up is a Lie
I love the fact that you won't fall behind (or feel horribly gimped) if you don't spend a cent on this game.
the drop rate is lower than it says for 4 and 5 üåü servants
I enjoy the unique card like gameplay and story of fate grand order. Mainly story.
GREAT GAME IF THE I SALT ISNT TO HIGH.But i cant stop because im addicted to it
gaccha helllllllllll
Love it to death!!!
love the battle sequences
lengthy and fun summoning sucks though keep getting generic summons
"Compared to other gacha games, I respect this one the most due to it's ftp friendly format"
summons can do better
My best RPG. Love the stories and sexy servants of course.
this is a really fun game and the story becomes really interesting!
I have been playing every day since the first weekend FGO was available. I'm still charmed by the servants and engaged in the story line. What more can you ask? I'm not a free to play participant but this is one game where F2P is not a lie.
Game and story is good and all but we need better drop rates for gatcha.
GACHA GACHA GACHA GACHA
Great game. Gacha is a cruel master though.
gacha hell..but the story of the game is so good
I like fire and moster trucks

Sorry but not my thing. Fanart looks great so i downloaded it. When I saw the actual game art I was disappointed. Azur lane's art looks so much better.
"Awesome story and beautiful aesthetics. The gameplay is also good and fun to strategize around but grinding can get pretty frustrating at times and you are at the mercy of random chance when trying to get a specific character(even if you whale, you might still fail). The whole game is fully playable, enjoyable and beatable even without the strongest servants but dedicating a lot trying to get your hands on your favourite only to get super unlucky is soul crushing."
pls update every devices pls some of us uses old devices pls update it to ald devices too
the game is crashing when i open it.please fix this
I've tried 3 times to play this and it won't even open. it downloads I try to open the app and it goes straight into my email to send about an error code 42 or 43. I'd really like to play this but this is ridiculous.
"Well the drop rates for servants in this game are just down-right terrible. I spent 500 quartz and didn't get a single 5 star servant. I'm just tired and done with this game. I'll take my money to a game that actually appreciates it. The funny thing is, if the drop rates weren't so bad, and I actually got even a single 5 star servant, I wouldn't be leaving, and I would have actually spent money to get future servants that I want. But now, unfortunately, they won't be getting anything from me. I guess people without gambling problems aren't this game's target audience."
you can play this f2p
could be better dokkan battle still stands on top cause the summons actually give u a chance and can get more summoning crystals with one mission instead of doing the same mission 3 times in a row to get a single summoning crystal
great game fun to play
"love the lore, been a fate fan since 2014's UBW. i highly recommend reading fgo's story as they have hilarious moments. if you play this game, be prepared to never get the characters you want but the f2p options will get you through w/o lowering the experience. I'm f2p apart from gssrs. good luck!"
you basically need money to get what servant you want especially the strong ones
Fun story. like the game. easy to get caught up in the story line.
"I promise that you will spend most of your time ""playing"" this game by being stuck at the loading screen. also, instead of linking to Google or Facebook like normal games, this one only gives a dumb code for account recoup. to use once. lose it, lose your account, and devs won't help. uninstalling, and never again bothering with any of the developer's games."
A great story best enjoyed if you don't worry about what servants you get.
Best way to chip yo time and increase your pride. I most definitely recommend this game if you're a farmer.
Got mhxA in 90 quartz
"it would be 5 stars if you could have a low detail mode or something because my phone is very good and high quality but I still have lag, please add low detail"
this game is so frustrating to play due to bs such as farming for materials being unplayably bad I've gotten near 10 ssr's and around 30 or so sr's so it's not my characters that are the issue but I can't upgrade them due to materials having such terrible drop rates such as octoplet crystals nearly 70% of the characters I have require 10 or 20 of them but there are no good ways to get them so I can't do anything it's extremely unfair something needs to change nodes need to be less stingy fix now
"this was a fun game but putting it down due to, too many gachas,the game has amazing characters and the story is also great but thats where the fun ends, Gameplay is probably this games weakest point here and tbh it wants to be this complicated game but the combat is so weird"
it is so cool BEST GAME EVER üòÇüòÅüòé
"bland gameplay. lackluster events. story and characters are ok, if you even get any. lliterally the worst summon rates for any gacha game on playstore. dont waste a dime on it. play for free till you get bored then delete it. 1/10 wouldn't recommend. better off playing The Alchemists Code"
The thing that made FGO stand out from the gacha crowd are the character designs. All of the servants feel unique and memorable.(rip phantom and eric)
Amazing game as well the customer care is top tier. I lost my account and within a day I got it back. Thanks a bunch Fate/Go Biggest issue with the game is how stingy they are with quartz. Not to mentioned with the terrible rates it's ridiculous how much time you need to save in order to summon any unit. Not to mention celebrations are terrible compared to other gacha games. As if they have so much pride and refuse to give more than 20 quartz at a time
Its so Great its Amazing
"Horrible pull rates, game is fun. Runs a bit slow but decenct graphics. Mostly story based and lots of grinding. No PVP"
if the rates where better then i'd give it a five star but I LOVE the series as a whole.
it is amazing and great gameplay
"love the game, but most of all I love the lore and the overall feeling of accomplishment from strengthening my favourite characters. definitely a must play for Fate fans. Here is to more historical characters getting added in to the game and the Fate Universe."
"One of the best mobile RPG, anime, turn based games I played since Brave Frontier. It's very addictive, if you're really into Fate anime series."
would love to play but apparently its bot supported on my Nexus 5x...
"Everything is great but i wish, instead of the transfer code or going to support to try to get your account back, there was a way to link the game with eother a google accout or facebook. This would be way easier for a lot of people..."
good story bad gatcha
I honestly love the game from the story to the events I just wish it wasn't so much of a pain to save your account cause I go though a few phones so it's a bit difficult to save it
Fun games
its a very awesome game
can you please help me I am stuck in the tutorial because it says please press screen
joining in for ainz üëø
good game. I like the fate/grand order series but it lost a star because Astolfo wasn't in the game.
It is a good game great story but i dont like how to keep up with my account i wish I could link it cause it feels like a trick to get people to waste their money
wonderful
Solid game. Great waifus. 10/10 Would roll for mapo tofu again.
Very noiice.
Meh. not as good as i wanted it to be
"gacha ruined my life 10/10 Seriously now, if you know what Fate is, there's no reason you shouldn't pick this up. It's more a viaual novel than a game anyway, as the ""gameplay"" is fairly simplistic. If you don't know what Fate is, go watch Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Ufotable, 2014, the series, not the movie), then Fate/Zero. The order of those is arguable, since Zero is the prequel and technically was made first, but that's my personal recomendation."
"literally loose 2 stars 1st for drop chance bs...2nd because rate up is a lie. literally the games only 2 issues and it sucks I have to spend an unholy amount of time to farm it when I have school, work, and a family to deal with. I love the anime and this game but they re pushing waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! ( and that's a big understatement) to hard to make you spend money you dont have on this game. also I dont find it fun to drop money on at all because it doesn't guarantee me a 4*+ servant at all."
A good game for chasing waifus
LOVE THE ANIME AND I LOVE THIS GAME
my literal favorite game
its amazing
even after DL the game data it still takes so long to load anything...and after ur first tutorial summon good luck getting another unless u trying to drop crazy cash...
Make the tutorial skipable
koo
oh yeah yeah
i love this game and the anime series
A game about my favourite anime series? You bet it has my full support
superb
"loving this game so far, the only problem i encountered here is the connection lost, i can't log in whenever i open the app even though my Wi-Fi is fast,pls fix it"
"More like Fate/Grand MONEY. This game is too hungry for in-app purchases. Beside that, it's decent. That's all I have to say."
"Fate GO has an awesome storyline, unlike most mobile games, and also has good game mechanics, even if they are a little unforgiving at times. Also the customer support is very helpful as I lost my account due to some phone malfunction and they were able to recover it pretty quickly."
Amen
I love the game but the rates are suffering
Fate/Grand Order is by far the most spectacular story to be found on an game app. It's random aspect is rarely unbalanced and in-depth gameplay means you aren't just there for the story or trying to get your favorite servants. (Still can't get Jack the Ripper).
The game is fun but the paid currency is too expensive for what you get
tyrannical jews
Gacha is bad civilization. Materials for skills are hell. Kotomine WILL spook you with his black keys. Bronze servants are better than you think.
cant even open the game. get error everytime
"Nice characters, nice automation, nice sound, bad summon system"
Best game story wise
will not load on my phone
"very good game, though i seem to have a problem. i actually lost my account since my phone broke before i had the chance to get the transfer code. pls i need help."
I can't get into the game it kicks me out üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò¶üò¶üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò¶
"This game gets fun the farther into it you get, I promise. The story is pretty interesting. The drop rates are pretty much trash, but play for a long time and you'll get the people you want eventually. If you're feeling salty because you don't get strong characters, just know that low class characters like Hans Christian Anderson and William Shakespeare, who are both 2 stars, can your starter 4 star into a 5 star in attack. If you play your card right(literally), this game is very fun."
Fun game but the amount of time farming and grinding for either materials or quartz could be a pain especially if your farming for certain materials but its overall a nice game with great game design and the characters you get are usually cool or interesting overall its a good game that does have its downsides.
it is cool aeh
Oh boy its a good game but why is the saint quartz so expensive and why tf are some of characters like Da Vinci and Nero FEMALE INSTEAD OF MALE?
need more waifu tho
I was having fun with the game until it told me to update. Now all my progess is gone as it's having me start at the begining. Please help me regain my progress.
"best gacha game, least generous devs. If you can live with that it's a fantastic pile of salt"
"favorite mobile game but gonna make me quit at this rate i was at day 92 login bonus and my phone broke and lost all my progress and all the money i put in(200) got almost back and my 4yo son wipes my phone and i lost all progress and money (90). some way to back up data with google play or fb would be great or at least help a guy out for being a loyal player and supporter that said it is my favorite in terms of story , events and even the gatcha system is balanced."
I love this game. it is the best game I've ever played
"If you're a fan of the Fate/Et Cetera franchise, Grand Order is a fun little romp through history Nasu-verse style, fighting to preserve/restore humanity's future with an assortment of Heroic Spirits as your allies. If you're new to Fate, this probably isn't the best entry poinr but it can still be an interesting game."
BEST TURNBASED IVE EVER SEEN
This game has a better chance of goty than fall out 76
This game is great.
like
really good game
lots of fun
great game for anyone who's a fan of Fate.
gacha hell is good civ
good time waister but not being able to keep my progress through other means n making it overly complicated to move your save is unnecessary.
"For a mobile game the story is good. Roll for ya waifus, husbandos, and ?s. U dont have to be a whale to enjoy the game, maybe a Sea Otter or can go f2P which u can. Became a sea otter cause of a character."
Ive been playing this game ever since it was first relased and I still cant stop playing.
"this is same as Japan, but before the good looks ^_^"
one of the best game out there
Its a great game and I always enjoyed it. Even the gacha system never really bothered me too much. My biggest and only complaint is the developers will not contact me back to re obtain my account. Stopped playing when there was no new events; and had to uninstall to make room. Came back in for camelot and contacted the developer to regain my account. Has been almost a week now of multiple emails and still no response. Pretty lame considering.
This game is just...wow.
Am a master!
my wallet and bank account are empty cuz of this game üò≠
the king is perfect
love it but it hurts my resolve of being f2p
I can not update my Fgo app to play
Bad Civilization
"More apologems would make this game better also this game is least rewarding for newer players as it's pretty grindy overall if you don't like grinding this game is not for you if you do, then good luck son"
Fun rpg card game!
The hope that my favourite servant will come home some day keeps me playing!!!
roll ƒë∆∞·ª£c memelin n√™n cho 5*
"4/5 ‚òÜ servant rates are less than what is given, rate up is a lie"
A great game. A little laggy at times but story and game play are very fun.
nice game!!
The only complaint I have is the summoning system. I mean I have summon with at least 200 saint quarts and got all three star stuff. Not even one four star servent so if you expect to summon a servant that's a four star or higher good luck.
I'm lovin it
"Although it's still 5 stars, I got sick of playing the game... Eventually, 'cause I didn't get Gramps, only Musashi."
The story and characters are really good gameplay is ok rates still suck but that probably won't change
Definately makes standing in line or going to the bathroom m9re fun than it should be lol!
"Yeah, it's a great game."
Best Strategy/Role-playing Game i've ever played. Period.
"When you get the right combination of servants,regardless of rarity, they can be extremely powerful"
love the game!
"Rates are pretty rough and rate ups dont increase the chance of getting an ssr, they only increase the rate of the character should you happen to pull an ssr at the normal 1 percent chance of getting an ssr."
Done
"One of the better game I have played so far. Yep, the gatcha is sh*tty, but you can still enjoy the game with lower tier servants and it is more fun like that as well"
i r8 it 8/8 m8 keep it gr8
"is fun, i love the backstories and lore for every single servant, is great... but i really have no luck with such games"
Very good game if your fan of gacha games or the fate series
Great gacha game for fans of the series.
i very like it as a Fate fan
"good game, takes up too much phone space."
gatcha is salt SALT I TELL YOU SALLLTTTT!!!!
Gimme more Saint Quartz!!!!
fate series is great. enjoying the game.
only bad masters think the game is hard lmao! even a 1* servant here is useful when used properly. They kept on saying the the rate up is low (which is pathetically right) but have they tried saving quartz? Wait and hope is the key.
Game for the Nerds... Just one problem... I want Alter Nobu and Nero
Waifu gacha game with good story and memes
üòÅ
Luv it
"If you love Fate, play this forever."
good fun turn based strategy game that has a good story. just watch out for the getcha
I wish I wasn't as addicted to this game's story (read: gacha) as I am.
Amazing stories. Great character development.
amazing and very engaging. I always want to play. the controls are easy to manage and the story is very subversive.
Best waifus and husbandos 10/10 üëå
I love this game especially my favorite character is martha (ruler)
Gacha is fair
fgo
"tried the game out a year ago only because it was fate related, and now I'm in love with it."
"low stars have their use, and interesting gameplay."
10/10 Best phone game ever
RATE UP IS LIE!!!!!
Fun and easy to play.
Great game to pass the time. Haven't ran to any issues while playing it.
honestly cant stop playing
tr√©s bien
"Despite what some may tell you, this game is free to play friendly, you just need to do your research and see there's lots of guides using low rarity servants to clear the hardest content. Overall you need to already be a fate fan to fully appreciate the experience, however."
guys this game is dangerous. think before you click.
you can learn and play
"Gameplay is fine, but the highlight here is really the story, most especially from the 5th chapter onwards."
This made my love for Fate grow stronger!
This is where all my money goes to be completely honest I'm addicted send help
Game is awesome.
A very fun game with more to come from the JP version
Great makes me want to die. In a good way.
10/10 Welcome to Gacha Hell.
I spent all my money of 2d jpegs of some anime waifus. 10 out 10 best game.
not perfect but best fate expetience so far
Best waifu collector ever
Gacha Hell is eternal
i got raikou
gacha is lie but game good
I gave a 5 star review. Plz give me 5 stars.
"enjoyable game, one of the few mobile games i play even when there are no events going on"
Summon rates are way to low
Can you update the animation of mordred and the other servants?
pretty ok
pretty good actually.

"unable to even load the game. opens to white screen then closes and opens email saying it can't be played. to add to it when replied to about the error it says I'm running a modified system and I would have to get my phone replaced to play. and NO my phone is stock from Samsung. no extras done to it unless Samsung did it prior to shipping to me. so ya, 1 star for trash until issue fixed."
"Game could be fun,but ruined by HORRIBLE rates,and i dont mean bad...HORRIBLE! What is the point of playing a game if you can't get any of the rare characters even after throwing your wallet at it? Games that bleed people dry like this game trys to do should be banned."
A fun light rpg game for fans of the Fate/Type Moon universe or for history buffs that don't mind the lines being blurred once in a while. The simple rockpaperscissors scheme gives way to more complex gameplay that is enjoyable. The downsides are the recharge time needed to complete quests that limit progress with some fairly low drop rates of mats which can make it take a long time to upgrade your favorite servants while you wait. This along with the very low ssr drop rate may turn away some
"An excellent gacha game with a story that is will make you not put your phone down for hours. Gameplay is great and has you thinking up strats on what servants to bring in certain situations and what cards (Buster, Arts, Quick) to choose to make the best combo. Overall the game is amazing and i am a huge fan of the fate series and support the developers 100%."
it would be awsome if we can play off online
"idk whats happening but i just downloaded the game and when I open it it just redirected me to my email and said ""Fate/Grand Order is not playable under your playing environment. Please contact us via email then we will give you an information about the data migration to the sender's email address."" pls help"
"The 500 character limit is nowhere near enough to express my love for this game, however, I wanted to support it by leaving a 5 star review. All i can say is that this game has to be one of my favorite games of all time, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Fate series, or who is just looking for an amazing game to play!"
There are no lewd CG's
Addicting game.
"Crazy characters, awesome story, a must have for mobile gamers!"
Nop
"Been playing since late 2017. It's quite a massive experience to be contained in a mobile game. While one may feel compelled to roll on shiny gold servants, it's far from necessary as this is one of the most F2P friendly games I've played. Often the game gives out powerful 4 star servants for event participation. My sole complaint is that it's unfriendly to non-launch players. Given how hard grinding outside of events is, new players will almost never catch up to their launch friends."
Best game I've ever seen in english from Japan yet. Would definitively recommend to my friends.
it's a fun game. Always new things coming. fun characters and events. original combat system. lots of lore. I absolutely love it. but as this is a review I will say this. you have to be ok with not always getting who or what you want. especially if your going FTP. you can earn alot if your willing to grind. but you have to be ok with not getting what you want sometimes.
can't run my FGO in OS 8.1... it says error code 61. I've just bought my phone you know :(
can you just add a facebook account link option
Phantasmic
"This is a game not for everyone. If you have any objections to microtransactions and no self control, this isn't your game. If you have a passing interest in the Fate series but no self control, this isn't for you. Dispite how much I want you to play. If you have just an ounce of self control and a passing interest in Fate, it's all you chief. The story for NA (part 1) is pretty good. The gameplay system is simple to pick up and guides you into thinking how to complex wave and boss clearing."
"I may have liked this more but when you reach level 122, replay all missions to scavenge all saint quartz in the game, and spend $50 on extra quartz but still have crappy servants, it isn't much fun."
AWESOME!
"I was never a fate/stay night fan, but when my friends introduced me to this game I was immediately in love! This game has great graphics, animations, great plotline with dialogue options, the voice acting is spectacular and the combat system is extremely intiuitive! The gacha system was new to me, but once you get addicted, you start spending more on summons, which is where the addicting part comes in.. if you want the good 5‚òÖ and 4‚òÖ servants, you better be prepared to pay a little bit."
"the game is alot of fun with a good story, but it keeps crashing, especially on devices with low memory and/ or ram (aka some mobile phones). I recommend playing it on a tablet or something."
My 5 best things is: 1.It is based on Anime 2.It has Great Turn by Turn fighting sequence 3.(for me) it has the best Animation on fighting 4.Best and SAD Story 5.Gacha Hell üòÇ
I love the game but I have to ask are transfer numbers one time use because the one I got I used several times now it's telling me it's already in use
I've never found a more enjoyable hole to throw my money.
gudo
Bad civilization.
I put so much time in to this game had an update error even though i had room on my phone and lost all of it ill still play cause its fun but i hope you add a way to back up data cause it super frustrating
I waste my money for quartz trying to get a servant and I never got it but I got one waifu at least
The game is really addictive and easy to play. Really keeps the player interested with or without knowledge of the Fate series.
So touching.
The story is masterful and fun. Gacha is pure evil though.
game keeps force closing
"Spent a lotta time trying to get Lord El-Melloi II for nothing, quit playing for a few years, picked it back up and got both my local legends (Billy the Kid and Geronimo, Pop√© when tho?) AND graced with the saint of all disaster gays Astolfo. Totally playing this again, even if it's significantly harder to level or earn currency than Dx2."
11/10 would waste money on 2d waifu
"The game itself is great. Shame the NA server is run by an awful localization group. Rewards are cut and scarce unlike the other servers. Pick this up to get a feel for the game and if you really are invested enough to play, move to JP server."
"fun good game, pretty and all and kinda good story near the end, but my god are the servant drop rates hurrendous dont be fooled you will not get who you want without shilling out the dough"
fix your rates. 1star for salt
"Would be a pretty good game but it's always loading and connecting...takes forever! yes, im on wifi too"
"The game is great and all but can you please make the game run on fullscreen? because im having black borders on the side and it makes it look like older game. i have 2:1 ratio display Huawei Honor V10, please and thank you in advance."
optimization sucks. everything else is generally good
data update is too much
love the game there is always something to do
"the graphics are good, gameplay is solid and it's entertaining BUT the summoning rates on good 4 or 5 star characters is Abysmal, basically a money pit. Even Bleach Brave souls has better summon rates than this. Fix this and I will give 5 stars otherwise just 1 star."
I've got some decent pulls so cant complain too much(cause I wants me a gilgamesh lol) but all in all a great game.
love it put English dub Japanese is irritating Fate Apocrypha is the best.
pretty good considering it's a mobile game that doesn't need you to give your life savings to enjoy it
Fhis game is amazing for weebs and people lookjng for an interesting plot. All you need to know is... its good
i just started and it has locked up im on the tutorial when it's asking me to issue my own commands and it will not work it does not respond to anything
now that i have played the game i can say for certain it was a great game it is the first mobile game i felt was fun the rolls tho they made cry in the corner with 2 saints quartz but that does not matter great game overall would say it is defintley worth your time
Huge fan of the entire Fate franchise I LOVE this game! have been here since the beginning and will never stop playing ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Do I need to know/play/watch any of thFate series to get into this game? Will I get ""overwhelmed"" if I dont?"
I loved this game great story and game play.
"Awesome game but constantly crashes, please fix"
"cant play, freezes after 10 mins"
"Honestly, it's my favorite rpg on mobile and the one I'll be sticking with in the long run."

yaya love it fun and fighting rpg
the gameplay is alright at best. however the story really pulls through well and beyond.
"Yorokobe, shounen. *predates*"
very fun wifu simulator 10/10
hi cutie
Love the story soo much and the gameplay is quite fun too. Beside the gacha i think i enjoy this game.
"The game itself is great and it has a story that picks up over time. The characters make you want to spend on the gatcha for them, but unless you have insane luck dont expect to get a high rarity servant unless you are willing to spend an average of 100-300 dollars. I love this game and will keep playing it but fix the gatcha such low odds for even a chance at a servant is ridiculous. This is coming from a player with multiple 5 star / 4 star servants."
"I want to like this game since its Fate but I can't. Horribly long load times and it kills the battery. Short amount of gameplay because of how limited stamina is. I'm fine with the 1% drop rate on 5 stars, but the rest is too much. Maybe optimize the game more."
Yorokobe shonen! have another mapo tofu.
its has amazing gameplay
Awsome! Sabehhhr
"im highly dissapointed with the rates in the summon machine. I love fate, but I don't really understand why put my favorite characters hidden under these abysmall pull rates. no matter how much money I would throw at the game in support of this beloved series of mine I could not pull the characters that made me fall in love with the series. I woulda given more money in support of the game if the rates werent so bad. other than that gameplay is fine but I sure wont be spending much more money"
"BEST GAME EVER! im a F2P player and ive got six 5-star servants and thirteen 4-star servants! its more about luck and patient, even if the drop rates for them are crappy. im addicted to this game because of the characters and the heartwhelming story! fave singularities are Camelot and Babylonia!"
I feel harassed. Very offensive game. Npc kall me idot
"It has a confusing storyline that clears itself up, only to reveal another enigmatic scenario, but that only piques my interest more and lets my curiosity go wild. Other than that, the graphics are great, gameplay gives a fun challenge, and it doesn't chug down my battery juice - it takes sips. My only issue is about why I haven't played this sooner."
AMAZING
pls the rate up is killing me üò≠
i love everything about this game
"Ive been playing the game for a good amount of time now and i love the story and the characters, they're all well written and sometimes i even felt emotional while playing. Now the bad part, if you're F2P and you don't have good luck prepare yourself cause the gacha it's really painful, i haven't been able to obtain one SSR, i enjoy the game with my 4 stars and lower but i don't have that much of variety when it comes to team comps. The grind for materials it's depressing too as well as the stam"
another English release that started off great but will now get censored and changed for no reason at all smh is really why i cant trust English releases anymore
"Amazing game for new and old fans of the Fate franchise. Great characters from the various Fate visual novels, manga, and animes and an even greater storyline written by Kinoko Nasu himself. A simple yet complex combat style, definitely not for those used to hack-n-slash games, but also very f2p friendly as the story can be progressed and finished even only with the 1* to 3* Servants. A must-play for any fan of the series."
"The game does not launch, not playable what so ever. Until it is Playable it will remain a 1 star rating"
"Game takes a painful amount of time loading for everything you do in game. i am on a S7, but i just couldn't take it. the intro story was good and pulled me in. but the all the slow loading pulled me right back out."
"I uninstalled and lost all of my servants, I will never play again."
I've been a fan of Fate for years and I enjoy getting to play Fate when I can. I've gotten my friends playing the game and its funny to watch them compete with summons.
this trash doesnt start
this piece of trash won't even start
Well done
"If you would have said EA developed this game I would believe you with the amount of times I've been screwed, the game is great, but with the amount of money they require you to spend for Saints Quartz along with how overcrowded the summonings are with useless Craft Essences I already have tons of or don't need paired with how many servants are in this game, you might as well call this Fate: Battlefront because of how low the SSR5 and servant drop rates are compared to the useless amounts of CE's"
I LOVED it! it was such a good experience!
"I've been playing this game since launch, and have been picking it up and putting it down frequently. Despite that, I have to say that I really do love this game. While it does have microtransactions, they are entirely ""optional"". You can play this game completely free to play by saving up your quartz and summon tickets for the servants that you really care about having, although paying can get you a lot more servants. Overall, I love Fate GO and would recommend it to anyone who is a Fate fan."
great game I love the combat using cards for can be hard for some to get into the gacha is hate full at times but when I do pull a five star I feel exhilarating the story is great to me pS I did get Jalter as my first 5star so I was never salty about it too much use her on every team
"This game won an award of excellencey at the 2018 Japanese Games Awards. Also an anime is in the works based on FGO's Camelot, Babylon and Solomon chapters. FGO is an amazing game to play, I've been playing FGO for a year now. Since the game developers are still producing monthly content in Japan till this day, I see myself playing FGO for a couple of more years. I highly recommend Fate Grand Order to anyone who wants to play a mobile game with in depth storyline and amazing characters."
Gacha ruined my life :^)
The game is good but can you please add a quest to earn more saint quartz because its hard to get it. I suggest that when summoning 10 pulls 5 star servant will be guaranteed because the saint quartz is hard to get. Its annoying sometimes when we summon 10 pulls yougive us a lot of useless craft essence. We poor people is only free to play we dont have enough money to buy those saint quartz.
I like the game and all but I am having connection issues more often. please fix soon
"Objectively, as a game, FGO has awful gameplay and mechanics, imo. It's also very grindy. However the story is good and Fate fans will probably enjoy it."
"This game is ADDICTING. I have been playing this game for over 2 year and haven't spent a dime. It's super fair and makes it easy to progress through and you are never pressured to buy something. It can be challenging in a good way later on. If you're a fan of Fate series, give this game a shot. I recently made a purchase in game because I WANTED to support this game. Trust me, that's rare!"
THE BEST GACHA GAME EVER. THE GAME ITSELF IS LITERALLY HELL. THIS IS THE WORST SERVER OF FGO. BETTER PLAY THE JP VERSION.
I have a fun time with this game but i wish it didnt steal all my money for waifus.
Been avoiding this game for a long because of how bad it is to play as F2P but playing it recently just to really give the a fair chance Gameplay honestly the gameplay isn't that interesting you are pretty much playing this game for the story and waifus Story can't say much other than good and the fact this is a FATE series game Gatcha rates and Drop rates well this is pretty much the downfall of this game its horrendous so if you plan to F2P this game good luck especially if you like collecting
i couldnt play it i have downloaded it a couple time but it wont open the game
Excellent turn based rpg. The Fate series is amazing and this game expands it perfectly
"This game is fun, but there are quite a few aspects that I am not fond of. 1) I love that we get powerful women, but the amount of fan service geared towards males is really ridiculous 2) Too many historical figures turn into girls, seriously 3) many of the male characters we do get are not pleasing to look at...like absolutely no effort made compared to the girls 4) I also feel that the female characters tend to be victims of harrassment in the story line (i.e blackbeard aka a gross pervert)"
"Cant play it because i have a custom rom and magisk üò¢. i understand that they dont want people to mod the gamr and stuff, but noe i cant play üòî"
I in all honesty love this game the story the servants everything about it however I am upset to say that lately it has done nothing but cause my phone to restart everytime I open the app so i can't play it like i want too . i even got too Camelot then that's when everything started going wacky I tried clearing Cache and fixing my ram this is my only app it still won't work. I've spent alot of money on this app lol I just want it too work again.
best app game I'm glad I played this game Long Live fate Grand order!
brry brry nais
"It's a fun game with a excellent story, but the rng is a bit harsh at times."
Where is my old account. I tried using my transfer code but it says it's already been used.
"Overall great game, story beautiful and very comedic, characters drawn amazingly, and you dont even have to watch the series to understand the concept. Good job and keep up the hard work!"
"Surprisingly good for a mobile game. gameplay is a turn based rpg with rock paper scissors combat between classes composed of the classic 7 and some special classes like ruler or the new shielder class. Some servants are unfortunately not very good but with the right team you can make any of them work. Gacha lottery rates are frustrating, if you want a favorite character you have to get lucky during a rare rateup. story gets really good once you get to the Camelot story arc. Very grindy though."
"Get ready to be salty, because the pull rates are garbage"
I sure do love craft essence more than SSR servants
I Love This Game So Much
it's pretty dope
i cannot play the game.
Total cash grab. Paid 200+bucks for this game and all i got are crappy essences and crappy servants that i already have.
"prettily great, lots of waifus."
Very nice!
"So far I am enjoying this game solely for the story, and while I don't care about things like servant rarity there is one major thing that I am dissatisfied about, the leveling system. It does not make sense to me that servants do not gain experience through battle, instead we are required to chance upon leveling cards and other servants to sacrifice to the ones we want to level. Experience is the best teacher but this system feels sorta pay to win for me due to low drop rates for level cards."
this game teaches me that rate up is a lie
so i just downloaded this game and as soon as i click on the app it closest and brings up my email to email you guys something about an Error 43. i sent an email. i will change to different stars when i am able to play.
I have yet to spend a dime on this game and have gotten all the 5* Servants that I've wanted. Graphics and Story are great. RNG really has a toll on how your Experience has tho since not everyone has EX F2P Luck.
really not for me. incentivizes spending an absurd amount of money for everything really. just awful anti-consumer stuff
its fine. IAP is ridiculous along with gacha tho
I love this game.I highly recommend it to everyone that loves fate.
love the game... just dislike the SQ purchases... the bonus SQ SHOULD count towards paid ones... making a youtube video on my review on the game
Amazing and addictive app I recommend to play this game for anyone who is a fan of the Fate series.
"Having an SSR is pretty fun to use, but you don't need them to play the end game content."
"I never thought that I've ever put the money on the game as much as this game before, it's hell."
cherry mobile flare s4 mt6753 octa arm64 bit bug
I LOVE SABER
Fun but still not optimized for my note 9. It's very off on its size and doesn't fit.
The Gacha summons are horrific in your chances of actually getting something good. Makes the game extremely irritating when you can't even win because you don't have good enough servants to fight with. Your best luck of ever getting someone good is to pay them $400 and roll the damn thing over and over and over.
The only game I play on my phone
"So, I'd love this game if it wasn't such a time suck. I have android, and fate go hates Android. My load times are RIDICULOUS. 4 minutes to load a battle. Another 4-5 to just load the game. Downloading all game data does not improve speed. Why do you hate android fate go?! Whyyyy"
I absolutely love the story and the characters! Each one was so well thought-out and the graphics are great!
"Terrible, has ability to be a good game but costs too much for people who are smart with their money, they need to give more Saint Quartz for even chances."
it's so damn good. .add more stories please..
its a fun game but the amout of 4 star craft essences is brutal.
worst pool rate for summons
never played a mobile game that has connection problems with the application. this is a game u don't want to waste money on because u can easily lose all ur data and probably have to redownload the whole game. people have had this issue for a year now and they haven't fixed it. my wifi connection is amazing and i got unlimited data. it kicked me out of the game like just one day after playing it but this is just lazy. not even the most boring game does this
"game is fun. but minus 1 star for a combination of always having an internet connection being required, inability to only fight with your servants (and all support ones from other players are overpowered for a good portion of the game, ruining the fun), and the enervy/ap function (limiting how long you can play until you have to wait to get more ap)."
I ordered gave them my BEST opinions I even have more to tell them but this advice I gave them needs to BE added. That doesn't mean I not going to play this game anymore I still going to play this game because it a great story.i say it won more time it differs ideas I gave them for the game.
the gacha system is mainly just for buying and gives impoverished players no way to get good characters
its really acdicting and it is agreat game except for the E-rank luck and Gatcha Hell
"Game made me cry and not just because of gacha. Story is pretty good, waifus amazing, really mininal powercreep. Best gacha game out there."
Great game for those who want to start to learn about the Fate series. Not a bad starting point. Gameplay is all right. Gacha is hell but it's what you expect of gacha.
Fun but Gacha is rough
Great game with an amazing story. Every fan of the fate fan will love this game. It is difficult to get a 5 star but be patient and you'll get them. Amazing game!
couldn't open game on galaxy s9
it's fun and nice if only the probability of getting a ssr servant is a little higher i would definitely enjoy playing it more though
Crashes wayy to much support is very very bad
"Not the best gacha rates, and definitely grindy but I do enjoy it for what it is."
Game crashes on Samsubg Galaxy S9+ using Android P.
I wish there were more free servants to get in the friend draw but I love the game regardless. Just a little tired of getting the same servants repeatedly lol.
"not playable under my environment, whatever that means."
"Its a fun game, But I sort of find it Not very Fair that when Limited time Summons appear that you can only use paid Quartz' To summon them. Many people who play this game Probably dont have that kind of money to do such things. I think many of us would appreciate it of You could use Free Quartz during those Time Periods."
took forever to load and during a noble Phantasm the screen just went white and stayed that way. it looks interesting enough b ut unfortunately I can't give it more than 3 stars because I didn't get a chance to play it
"I like the game, but they've decided to start censoring it now."
YOROKOBE SHOUNEN | edit after like 500 days of playing: still rejoicing my way through everything. this game is golden y'all best mobage out there good graphics good story good ost and can be beaten easily as a f2p player. what more can i want from a free mobile game?
Loved it.
#nomerlin #nomusashi
only doing this to get astolfo. decent story.
Amazing! :)
"pretty good over all, it I have a problem with recovering accnt My phone broke and I am unable to get a transfer code- I had it on my other device and it said it existed on another device... which saddened me"
i will give Fgo a 5 star if i have Any SSR
"youre game is trash. so there's an event goin on that as long as you pay for 30 saint quarts, you het a guarunteed 5 star! this game is bad all around, the fact that, you cant get a 5 star pretty much without paying says alot about the game. could of at least made it to where as long as u had 30 quartz paid or not, u can pull. but your game is awful sooo"
data transfer is very very buggy. the gacha rate is terrible. the devs hardly listen to players suggestion. enough said
"Great Story, Great Voice acting of different servant, Different events with great plot. The downside is that the game's gacha that it only has a 1% probability of getting a 5 star SSR (but there are also campaigns in which specific 5 star SSR have rate ups). Nonetheless the Game is really worth it!."
this game is off the hook*.*
"I'd give this game five stars in everything, but I won't , only cause the 
game continually Force's close on me, it does it so bad that I can't even 
complete one quest. It's just getting so frustrating that it makes me want 
to uninstall it. Please fix this or tell me how to, cause im a big fan of 
the show and would love to play this game without problems. Thanks"
grate game
"My First Review: Great game but be warned the gatcha rates are only 1% chance for a 5 star. Honestly you don't need 5 stars, you can play though the whole game without them. Just don't get too mad over drops and pulls. If you can do that you'll love the game. 1st edit: I absolutlely love this game, i have played and logged in every day since launch. This game is fantastic and ive gotten my best friends into it too. Ill play this game till the day it end. FGO for life. Friend Code:"
I cant play the game
"it's an okay game, plenty of things to do, just pretty lame that it's your typical ""pay to win"" game. good to waste time."
Love the game hate the rates. You can clear the game with low rarity servants but the characters you want are most likely 4 or 5 star servants and some of them limited time only.
"game is buggy for some reason after the update. game just stops working when you finish leveling up/ascending/accessing servant voice lines, etc. this needs to be fixed ASAP."
Poorly translated. I've played the Japanese version. Gacha is as expected. However NA is poorly managed Twitter and Facebook updates are bland and boring always crying for likes and shares with little in game rewards. A great game nevertheless. Poorly optimised for iPhone x.
not playable in Pixel 3XL. It crashrs right away.
"boring tutorials at the beginning, takes too long to get into the action. not very fun once you do get into the action. needs to automatically scroll through the dialogue during cut scenes, and I do appreciate the skip function."
"This is an amazing entry for the Fate series. With the first story complete, I eagerly await the next chapter. My only hope is that it could get offline capabilities one day."
"best game on the market ""if"" you pulled your fave characters."
spent 90 dollars on summons for only all my data to get lost along with said 90 dollars that was used in summons.... real great game.
super mega awesome fun time!!!!!
"Good solid parallel universe story for fans of the Fate series, battle graphics are unfortunately 3D based (so very battery consuming), and the 5* summon rate is so pathetically low that players almost pretty much have to pay to be able to proceed with the story. Not as F2P friendly as games like FFBE or FEH."
Phone games shouldnt have stories this good
"love the story, love the character and the bgm, the gameplay is easy to learn and if you joined the community it becomes complete, so many lore and character to discuss, this is a good game, the problem is the rate summon, but it is not a big deal, because you can clear story with just 1 to 3 star servant, but if you want that spesific rate up servant, than you better save those quartz"
PTW(Pay to win) a type of game that you really need to spend lots of money time to cheat
weeeeeeee! :-)
üëèüëè
one of the best games I've play in a while
"Game has terrible drop rates, top grossing game because people have attachments to the characters. Game is uninspiring, coupled with extra poor drop rates on 5 stars with no pity counter. Either they need to increase the drop rate like ffbe or add a pity counter like Dragalia Lost."
beatiful
i have an S9+ and the game fails to launch. i tried playing this game before and had the same issue.
"Want to play this game so bad, but it keeps crashing"
the gacha makes me wanna die but its part of the fun
"Initially the game is quite enjoyable. It's battle system is easy to understand. The game boasts a large array of mythical, historical, and fantastical heroes and while it's story can be rather lackluster it is still something to make note of. However, the main issue lies in the gatcha system. It's rates are, quite frankly, abyssal. In the early stages of the game you'll hardly notice this, but long-term it becomes quite clear that if you want to progress smoothly your money is needed."
Rate up is only sometimes a lie. Most of my waifus come home so can't complain as far as gacha games go. The combat and story depth keep me coming back daily.
"Great game. graphic, story wise is amazing. There is a lot of details in the side missions for every servant and many events. I love that with good strategy you can beat any enemy. the only downsides are the rate ups. It takes too much to get the servant you want. You can literally waste hundreds of dollars and not get what you want since bonuses mix with the rolls. if any dev, read this, at least for the first summons make bundles or fixed prices for servants and keep gacha for Np5 or CEs"
"Been having fun with the game. Grind is boring at times but story, gameplay, and event challenges are top-notch."
"It is a fun game, but I should be able to use my free EARNED saint quartz on the summons rather then buy my way into anyone with money can do that but to sit and actually finish the missions and earn the quartz which was a waste because now I can't use them."
"best game, most expensive game"
This game is absolutely gorgeous...
just great!
Because the new years summon you can only do with chronos crystals you buy what if people dont have any money to buy them?
Fun Game. Cool Characters. Can play for hours and hours.
"poorly optimized (running a Samsung Galaxy Tab A) im playing at like 10 fps, i feel like im playing in decelerated time at all times. Ui is an absolute eyesore at best (everything except the dialogue screens in story) and tear enducing at best (summon screen banners?). i dont like how they force you to burn your ""free summon gift"" on their scripted banner. Art is nice of course and using your favorite servants is great. Your free servant is the cutest anime girl. Story has merit."
"A fun game to play with lots of story and loveable character, that you will bond with. (you may sell your soul to this game)"
clashes with pokemon go and will not open
My Favorite Game to play at this time! an ABSOLUTELY GRIPPING STORY! AND LOVABLE CHARACTERS.
Drop rates for your characters are the worst. Would salt again 10/10
"The story is nice but the gacha rates and severe lack of content ruin the game. Do not play it, no matter how much you like this franchise."
Detailed story
love ganes Fate Saber 100% :)
fix the rate drop please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GUD GUD
alot of waifus and hasbandos to get do have fun
"I really liked this, but after clearing the first two worlds the game wont load for me. so I lost my daily log in bonuses and cant get the NYE 5 star draw. very frustrating."
We will never forget you Dr. Romani
"Regardless of the amount of salt the summoning rates give you, I think we can all agree that you won't find another gacha game with such a riveting story like this one."
"super fun, I love the character art"
This game isn't the best game out there but its a pretty damn good one defiantly one of my all time favorites
I'm in debt
"An interesting story concept and beautiful graphics are crippled by a card-based combat system, which is immediately broken by the game FORCING you to take other people's characters on EVERY SINGLE mission! (Meaning high level characters ruining any semblance of ""game balance"" straight away)."
"it says you wont lose your save data by uninstalling, but it forgets to mention that you need to make a restore code beforehand. otherwise very fun!"
"Finished the Grand Order, made some friends, lost some as well... it's a hell of game and a perfect way to end the year. Happy New Year everyone."
"Doesn't use Google Play to back up your data. Paid money to build up a collection, and something happens to your phone? Thanks for your the money, you lose everything. Every minute of progress, every penny you spent building your collection. All of it's gone."
"The Fate universe has quite a lot going for it, but this might be one of my favorite entries in the series. A gigantic cast of Servants, a story that starts with a slow burn and quickly picks up the pace, and a combat system with just enough complication to not bog down the play."
Great experience would recommend Wish there was a safety net for summons though
"So much more than I ever expected of a phone game. It's the top grossing phone game for good reason. The outstanding storytelling is really what makes you question, ""this is a free phone game?!"" On that note, it is possible to play the entire game for free. There aren't even any ads. The gacha can be frustrating as any, but there are a lot of excellent lower ranking pulls that many still rely on in spite of having top ranked servants. Overall not without its flaws, but I'd recommend it any day."
My favourite gatcha game
Very well made the best app game I've played so far but would like to have the drop rate change and made a little more easier to grind it takes up too much time and resources and it makes the player rather wait for the next event rather than play the game.
It's a great game!
"The storyline starts off a bit weak but then blows you completely away. The writing is truly incredible. For those who think you need 4* & 5* servants are wrong. One of my most frequently used servants is a grailed one star. His NP is stronger than some of the 5*s. I used him throughout the entire Babylonia and Solomon singularities. He delivered every time. Don't fall for the ""gold"" trap. Besides, there are PLENTY of whales that'll support you. One of the best turn based battle games to date."
"I don't usually play mobile game with micro-transactions, but this game is well worth the exception."
i can't load the game. it shows me a black screen everytime i load it either using Wifi or mobile data.
"I take back all complaints, play this game if you're a Fate fan or just want a good story."
give me a 5 star and ill give you a 5 star
"Now that the ending to the first part of the game is up, I thought it appropriate to finally review the game. Fate/Grand Order is an epic title. boasting one of if not the strongest narrative in mobile gaming. You wouldn't know that starting out though. as it takes a while to actually really going. However, it does have its stellar game play to carry it through first. It's strategic, flexible and most importantly fun. its only downside are the drop rates for 4 and 5* servants."
"Its a good game but the only problem is that its not Released in UK I have to use a USA VPN so i can instal the game , can they make the release for UK"
"Well it took sometime but it's done from when I first started my account on my old phone with only 2 singularity playable i couldn't wait to see what this game had, but alas my phone broke and i never got to continue so i gave up thinking to return in the future and was i surprise of how much i missed i wish i could have been there for the events and other moments of joy but enough of me. This game has such an unique story and really pulls you in once you start playing you'll get the hang of it"
despair
"This game in my opinion, is the best mobile game I have ever played."
"Great for long time fans of the Fate/ series and newcomers alike. Gameplay is simple, new events and servants are released at a steady pace, and NO POWER CREEP!"
worst game ever lost all data and spent about $200 on it had great servents. i had to get a new phone and lost all my progress and all my servents!!!
good art and easy to play
very niiiice
lel
You gotta be a person with no friends to play through the end.
bullied a demon God to get gallstones to feed to snek waifu. 11/10 would roll In gacha hell again.
The loading screen when I'm going to enter a battle is so slow it takes more than 3 minutes before it finish.
"Nice gameplay. But it's too salty ("")>"
"i gave you a 5 star, now maybe FATE will give me mine lol great game"
this game is not work to my phone ZH&k plss do some thing I love the game and i want to play it<3 plsss...reply if you read
very nice game
I love this game. The story and characters are amazing.
I CANT PLAY THIS GAME
The only gacha game I've played (I've played 4 gacha games in my life) where I took a break and still made me come running back to it. Been playing since day 1 and I'll continue to keep playing (atleast casually) for as long as I can.
"Very disappointed, I installed this only to have the app repeatedly crash on launch trying to access my email I was seeing something like Error 61 then something before my email would then crash then the app would repeat this process non stop I had to literally unplug my Nvidia SHield TV to get it out of this non stop loop after an hour of multiple uninstall / reinstall and retries with same result I ultimately decided to unistall this for good so much for trying this game."
Hashire sori wo~ Kaze no you ni~ Tsukimihara wo~ P A D O R U~ P A D O R U~
"if you lose your account or if something goes wrong, the support team will not help you, they will ask for all the necessary information and then theyll do nothing. All of your progress gone."
horrible i spend 200sq and i didnt get merlin Q-Q still 5* :P
I love the graphics but im still learning the game play
"Eats my money. You'll want characters from summons but never get them. Instead you'll probably just get the same 5 star ""CE"" 5 times in a row. The Grind in this game is a pain. Monsters only drop things 10% of the time and in most cases you dont get the materials you need. I can only recomend this game to people that like hitting their heads against walls or like waifus and husbandos."
Good game plagued with the inability to save your game other than that set back it's a decent game that I feel fans of the /Extra series would appreciate
Tips for new players: Once you are done with the tutorial always go to my room and get a transfer code in case you accidentally uninstall or change your phone. Other than that have fun playing :)
"1th lebih, gadapet merlin. Pen pensi"
games good if u got a wallet full of money
like the graphics and everything but its now crashing so bad i cant get past the main menu in to do anything on the app
why does my credit card balance say 3000 dollars apended on this game whil havent even bought a card yet . .jk hahhahha lol lol no
I GOT MERLIN
I changed devices and lost all my save data I'm still using the same emails and everything only difference is the device and number
It doesn't work on Android Pie. Please update the game.
Fun game but I can't play on either of my phones because of blanket blocks.
"when i tap the app, it's always crash please fix it"
Fate Grand Order is amazing in my opinion and has loads of servants/characters that keep me playing it
"The gameplay, story, and graphics are great but the fact that this is a gatcha game really lowers my appraisal. It is totally possible to beat the game as a f2p player but the developers really want your money because it's difficult to get the free servants because they lock them behind exclusive event items you have to roll. Even in terms of gatcha games their are better alternatives. the percentage of getting a rate up 5* servant is at best 1%. That's ridiculous. Go play another gatcha game."
"A very entertaining game I gotta say, rage quitted and deleted my acc 9 months ago and came back to start a new acc 2 months ago and gotta say I'm happy as I rolled raikou and merlin. Summons can sometimes be very irritating and frustrating but ya'll people who complain about the drop rates just be very PATIENT and use Sq WISELY for your favorite characters. I'm f2p player as well"
destroyed my life 10/10
Save to Google Play or Facebook like most of the other games do. it will make it easier to get back into the game or switch phones.
does not open and just opens up email work crash info
love the game üòÜüòÜüòÜ
"For a mobile game the story is so engaging and it really draws you in, the gameplay is great turned based strategy that really makes you think when it gets harder. my only problem is the rates for servants but thats all part of the grind and makes it really enjoyable when you get that certain servant. power on my fellow master's!!!"
heat
fire
Pretty good. Plenty of salt.
"1 The Gachta rates are insaine and feel way to Pay to participate for a 3 star or higher. 2 The combat get repetitive and the quest are like, why am i doing this? 3 The game has been very niche and not very open to different types of players, its very punishing. 4 rewards suck making it an insaine grind. 5 the grind to get a character leveled up and limit broken and basically useable is insaine. 6 events are rediculus and over the top and feel liek they are designed for day 1 players. 7 $$$$$$$"
well ill let you know how the game is if i ever get to play it. It tells me theres an update that never presents itself. gj guys....
I love it.... that's just it üòÇ hahaha
Good story and fun characters
can't save the game when you want to play on another device or when you reinstall the game. sucks to lose hard earned characters.
quality story plot awsome gameplay machanic 1* and 2* characters are very helpful even compared to 4 and 5 * so the gatcha system is fair
Game is lame I didn't get Jalter edit: now i didnt get Merlin game sux even more
Mind helping me... The game keeps crashing i can't open it i tried to clear the data and cache but its not working i try uninstall it then install again but it keeps saying fgo can't be installed... Help me
Addictive game indeed ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
Greedy trash stay away
very great game. it does lag slightly but that's not a major issue at all. i'm just glad to be able to play a game based on the series.
"Loving Aniplex's localizations. All the servants are great, even the low star ones. My favorites are Medusa, Ibaraki-Douji, and Merlin."
its a great but a game that kinda that destroys the body and mind the user he/she doesnt get a good roll and also expensive in game products
addicted to this game
"It's fates milking, that's just it."
"While the story and writing is great, the designs on alot of characters needs work and the gacha rates are absolutely abysmal where $200 wont even give you decent odds for a 5 star"
"Fantastic game if you enjoyed the ""Fate"" series"
guaranteed to take your money and your dignity üôÇ
ohh wow
its a really good game the only thing holding it back is the gacha
really love the game but there is a little glitch where sometimes the game will kick me out of the app can you fix that please thank you
"Pretty good game. Story has an original style of it and on a different universe with the other fate series but still has the same master-servant concept. Gacha was the same as other gacha games out there but with really low chances of getting it. My only problem with this game is how unsecure the binding codes is, I mean why not make it like other games (Azur Lane) in where we can bind it using our twitter or facebook and use it over and over without the need of getting a new code everytime."
"I love this game, i just love the graphics of this i love the story line the character design and the overall game play of this and i hope you change the loading screen coz its a bit slow so yeah over all i really like it‚ù§üòç"
"I love history and myth, this game is all about what ifs regarding both while personifying the characters from said medium, just wish they were a little kinder to the English audience, but hey at least we know what's coming ;)"
"As long as there's a good STORY, not repeatitive gameplay. As long as there's SUPERB update and CUSTOMER RELATIONS that provide the gamers needs and addresses issues inside the game. I can personally conclude that this game is a BEAUTY and EXCELLENT in its SIMPLIEST form. - Maxwerewolf (1980's Gamer)"
"summon rates are garbage, no good way to preserve your data. until one of these are fixed, i wont take this above a 1 star rating. I love fate, but i wont be taken advantage of by fate. they don't get my time and money if they don't respect either"
i love the game and the graphics......
Awesome game and addition to the fate series. Strong storyline too. Can't wait until the anime adapts everything here.
"the support system sucks. please fix your support system, ive sent an account recovery form and still now reply, not saying if the information i gave out was incorrect or not. if you could make the support system much better then ill give 5 stars üò§üò§"
I love this game so much it's fun
As a newer fan of Fate/ I believe the game alowws the carry on of the feeling I found by seeing the series and wanting more
It's a best game ever for the fans of fate/universe.
no ishtar pepehands
cool game
it's an ok way to kill time
RIP Barbatos
gets better after rome
I got Scatty xd and np2 mo
"Good game, but the gacha is a cruel mistress."
As a long time fate fan I will say that I love this game. Do your research before playing and you will have an even better experience especially if new to this game. But if you like any old school final fantasy games or things of that nature you will love this. the characters are perfect and the writing is always going to have the right amount of comedy geared towards the brilliant character development.
I have played this game for a few years now. Great conept and game play. Weird drop rates. You get nothing for a long time and then You score some good stuff.
Gacha that is all
"I love the gameplay and the story. I would love to see this made into its own anime. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the glitches and bugs. There aren't many but when they do show up, it's bad. Most of the time I can't read the words."
This is really awesome but trying to get the one character you really want is hard.
"Lost my account last night. Emailed the Dev team, they responded quickly and helped me reclaim my account in less than 2 hours. That's the best support for any app I've used in the past. Really impressed me, keep up the good work guys"
This game is fun and very enjoyable
"You are stuck in a soul-crushing Purgatory that drains your time and resources, amounting to a fictional history that only you will remember. And you probably won't want to leave..."
I can not log inti the game it conatantly says it loads incorrectly please fix
"good story in the later chapters, has depth, and the roll system isnt necessary to clear the game, just exciting when you get something 5 star"
"Poor gameplay, every update requires more specs for the little improvements"
"great story and interesting characters just don't expect to get any of them. I know there a certain amount of luck in these games but when I spend hours and hours trying to get 180 saint quartz and 5 summoning tickets and don't even get one 4 star servant out of all that, then it's best to just buy them cause I'm almost positive they design it so paid saint quartz have better luck."
i enjoy it as it is!
"One of the saddest gacha rates of any game, but fortunately has plenty of content to enjoy outside of the gacha with its characters being silly in the story and events and interludes"
"Definitely a fun and amazing game. Aside from the gacha hell, everything is amazing, especially the storyline!"
"GIVE MERLIN, YOU LOSERS"
"great game, I spent too much money on it though lol"
great just wish it cost less to buy stuff in game
goodo
Game and all is fine but a ten times summon should not be a guaranteed 4 star anything but a 4 star hero because craft essence is not worth 30 saints quarts and I haven't pulled a 4 star plus hero in forever just 3 stars and craft essence.
Need more Saberfaces HREEEEEEEEEEEE
"Surprisingly fun and has kept my attention for half a year now. They put out new, well done events often enough to not get bored, but not enough to burn you out. Story is pretty good. Maintenance is short and rewards are generous afterwards. The premium currency is too expensive, but there are plenty of ways to get it in game. Plus they aren't constantly ramming ""buy our currency"" down your throat. It always feels like the developers care a lot about their players. Highly recommend."
one of the best anime games that's out there.
"While not the smoothest graphically, and the battle system could use a tiny adjustment in enemy targeting the overall gameplay and balancing to make every servant worthwhile I very fun. At first I thought 1 and 2 stars were useless, but many tend to have devastating NPs and abilities to buff and disable, and while the grand summons can get VERY grating with the random chance, it's overall most of the time worth the grind to see that one or two servants u love reach their final Ascensions."
"I have loved this game since the early versions and I'm so glad it's already out in the Play Store! would recommend for anyone who loves history, rpg, and VN gameplays!"
there's a hole in my wallet now
No matter to paid this game. just free to play you can get the same what $100+ paid. I'm done for this game. so regret to paid in this game too much.
love it. just cant summon any more golden servents. damn drop rates
"game is fun, but the best advice I can give to new players is only spend as much as you're willing to lose."
almost best anime game ever but... well RATE UP IS A LIE
absolutely subarashi
best Gacha game ever good luck with your rolls
"Extremely fun game, but the 4 and 5 star rates could be higher."
I love this game. I just wish that the characters would speak English.
Just dont get addicted to the gacha system
NYEEEEEEEEEEEEESS
"The writers for the stories are awesome. If you like the anime you'll be addicted to the game. Gameplay is unique and makes you strategize your moves, players, and add ons."
this game makes me happy :)
wonderful story anh characters
The RNG god has favored me this year.
I love a game with a good storyline üòÑ
awesome game not so awesome wallet :(
"Started off really fun, but the grind get real after a few weeks. The drop rate for good heroes is terrible. my girlfriend gets all the good 5* heroes and I get garbage essence duplicates eternally. was really hoping that I would get Merlin, sadly I didn't and am now un installing. Funny I would have spend a fair sum on thos game if it ever, even one time gave ame a decent hero. Your bad dev."
I spent money thats worth a luxury car
addicting
if u like famous people coming to life as powerful beings or u like gacha with a heavy story this is the game for u.
"I can't play it, I message you guys already about error code 43 it said turn off your developer mode or debugging mode off but still i cant play it please help"
Great game awsome graphics
Best Game 10/10... I really love the fate franchise so it's good plus it seems like RNG Jesus loves me... So thank you Type Moon and Delight Works for bringing this game to us... (WHEN IS THE TSUKIHIME REMAKE THOU TYPE MOON)
Give me more SSR
I rike it.
Fun. Good graphics. Gacha is low af though.
You can beat this game with free servants you get through events and such. but beware the gacha. It will devour your cash.
I really love this game i would love to see a function qt lvl hmm id say 25 that the player can pick one 4 star of there choose or two 3 stars?
Awesome game with awesome fate lore
"The only thing I see is a serious issue is the lack of rewards for completing a Singularity and the AP cost of campaign missions as you get closer to the latest Singularity. Other than that, solid game mechanics and good story from Camelot onward."
best game love it so much
Amazing story and game mechanics
"This is such a good game to kill time. Its so amazing, the art of characters, voices, looks, and gameplay."
Great game with great story.
one of the best app games I've ever played!
Turn back now before the gacha claim you!
much gacha 10/10
RNG rate is sooo LOW
Challenging and interesting!
Great game for fans of the Fate franchise. A must-have.
Just hope there will be more free events.
I finished the entire vn in two weeks and now I'll probably lose money on this game. Edit: I lost money on this game
Excellent waifu sim.
Didn't get jalter = L salty af rn
Fun RPG mechanics and a plot that gets great by the Camelot and Babylon chapters.
"fun, great character and story"
"Probably my favorite game on my phone, been playing since the beginning"
A truly fun game with an energized and fun community. Full of all the interesting and in-depth content you could want.
Degeneracy
"This game is really nice, what I like about the game is that every servant is useful even 1 star servants, it's not about the rarity but once you've grail some 1 stars then they would be stronger like a 4 star servant. I'm still using my sasaki kojiro cuz why not!"
"super addictive with nice turn based combat and an extremely long story. pretty kind to free2play player as well. probably best not to play it unless you got a lot of time to kill like hundreds of hours to kill . would give controls a 5 out of 5 but the lack of a back button when viewing attack cards brings it down a bit. graphics also get a 4 because of generic ""caster bolts"" for some servants attacks"
"Babylonia's story, enough said"
"Salt is normal when playing a gacha game. Get past that, and it's actually a decent game with decent mechanics. Its greatest strength lies in the fact that lower rarity characters are actually not useless and have strong niche that they fufill. That way, you're not completely boned if you fail to get that op SSR."
that's hell you're walking into
"Best Fate Game EVER. The gacha games popularity in NA is thanks this game, so please show your respect. There are no big problems with the performance of the game if you have a regular to a good tablet or cellphone. but you should play in tablet if you want to enjoy it to the fullest. Good story, good combat system altough a little outdate and need some revision to balance it, but in the end is a great experience."
Rate up is a LIE!!!
You work so hard to get 30 quartz for what 2 back keys and 3 stars...
Rate up is a Lie !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The salt is bad at first, but like any ongoing pain, you grow numb to it and accept that this is reality. The game is good too, I guess."
"The game is great just with a little issues here and there(Loading ya know) But the game is fun. Beautiful servants, amazing story everything is great. I just wish saint quartz would be more plentiful so I could get servants easily. But all in all good game."
Was good until I redownloaded.Lost a my progress and doing the character arts is really laggy.
Is a 4.9 the summon rates are bad but that's about it everything else is stellar.
wont open.
i know everyone is angry about the gacha rate but that should not be the only element that sums up the game. This game has good story good events and also updates monthly. But if u want to get ur waifu or husbando prepare to spent hell of dimes
Bug crash after the loading please fix
Game full of waifus
"The game has a great story, which is hard to say for most free to play games. I enjoy the different personalities and diversity of the characters."
the games great but if you mess up in some way and don't get a transfer code you're screwed so the means of getting access to you're account should you be unable to access it needs an overhaul since in some cases you may have to restart much like I've had to thanks to the current system and have to wait till the next christmas event to regain some of my Servants such as santa alter and have to restart on my leveling with asterios and medusa as well as hope to get jack again thanks to losing her
"Are you an anime/visual/history (some artistic liberties are taken in portraying history) fan? If so, then this gam e is for you......"
taken a long ass time to get 90 of those gems to try and get another 4 star character have fun with ur one shity 4 star you will get at the beginning of the game u won't get another one less u but it with real money Basically hard work don't mean Dick here on this app.
Thrilling!!!
"The story is engaging and quite well written, the gameplay is alright and the art is decent,but i can't give the app even a 4-star because of the god-awful servant drop-rates.Some ascension materials are also so difficult to get. All i get from 10 summons are stupid craft essences and 1 or 2 star servants."
it takes way to long to build up the currency to do a summon.
the game is fun but the save Option sucks... then if you lose your account the help desk wint help yiu get it back so get use to having 15 transfer codes lsying around
"The art work is descent. However, Fate series perverts the mythology and legends I grew up with to the point that they have little to no resemblance to the originals. The gameplay is the most boring style of tick tack."
Hi.I like this game. This is like the best rpg game i ever played. pls make gacha rate higher or at the end of singularity the reward will be holy grail and 5star gacha ticket
Gacha hell!
it was amazing
great game. it can be time consuming if u don't know what u r doing.. but overall a fun and challenging game
very nice story and characters are amazing
Its the best mobile game ive ever played. But the only downside is that i now have to wait for events to play...fun
"Downloading this without knowing the fate series, that's hell your going into"
"Honestly, out of a majority of games that I have played, this has to be one of the most boring. The only things I liked about the game, is the fact that it is a Fate game, the beautiful art and the combat system. Otherwise, it is truly a bore."
this is a fun strategy game and I really storyline and the characters but there is one issue that I have and probably everybody can agree on is how the summoning is pretty bad because they have the servant and the equipment put together rather than apart I can understand if they put them together so players can get a chance to get a Five Star Equipment or five star servant and you only need 30 Quartz but why not have them separate but they have different value like the equipment needs 20 or 25 Quartz while the servants need 40 or 45 Quartz beyond that it's still a good game Edit: also the weekly quests are pretty bad because they give you 14 Quartz pieces total each Quest gives you 2 pieces and they are very easy to do but you have to Exchange 7 Quartz pieces to get 1 Quartz seemed like a good deal but you need 3 Quartz to use the single summoning and that you have to wait for a week to get more kind of strange that they're not daily Quest
"5 stars easy. I dont spend a single cent on this game, but still having fun. Funny though, a lot of players have hatred for this game simply because they cant get what they want and blames the devs for it. lmao. Anyway, I love this game. I can play Competitive games when out of ap. And back to casual fgo to see my waifu. Thats plenty enough for me."
"Why can't I play? I always got redirected to my Email app. Even I did put the correct email it says ""Service connection error""."
Grind
"Love Fate. Tried the game. The card thing is a little strange, but overall would of been fun if the loading times didn't take up to 5 minutes each time and there's a loooot of loading"
"Great game, with turn based combat, team building, stat min/maxing, and great characters. Just be ready to not get every character due to terrible drop rates, and grind for materials to level them up."
never lucky
"I'm a bit of a casual fan of the fate series. So, this game is nice. At first it seems simple, and it is. But, it's surprisingly deep. There's a ton of likeable characters, nice animation, good story, and it's rather fun. Be careful of the gacha salt and grind hell though."
Poor excuse for gambling.
It cool.
Goodo
This is cool game
ad
Educational plus vilance
It got saber
great game I play Jp though
"Love the game and the universe of the series. The only downside, and I mean Only, is the fact that the gacha has Gear and Units together. You're more likely [guaranteed] to gear rather than ANY type of featured unit. The only saving grace for this game's rare summon is that the free units are All 4star rarity, have good potential, and you can at least Get them."
it doesn't won't work on samsung phone!
I like the game it allows me to get new character.
"Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my chests... And these drop rates... Even my saint quartz. The apples I've lost, The cards I've lost(burned), Won't stop hurting. It's like they're still there. You feel it too don't you? I'm going to make them give back our future."
Great to learn mythologies in anime style
Fate is great
"As for the usual Fate franchise, the story-telling by Kinoko Nasu is deeply immersive in a vast world of clash between Heroic Spirits with their historical legends."
Won't open game. Can't play
"One of the BEST turn-based rpg's on mobile. Art is beautiful and animation is simple and smooth. To be noted to new players; this version is way behind jp version, but its slowly catching up."
"I love this game and have been following it since the beginning, but my phone broke with my account on it and I don't know how to transfer my old account to the new phone. Please help."
"Lost all my save data. Given the monetization formula, I could have been screwed."
Pretty much the best game that I have ever played. Just awesome!
It does not make sense how this kind of game that looks like a web browser game can take so much space and takes forever to load. I've played other games that has way better graphics and plays way faster than this. #wasteoftime
"I loved this game until my phone broke suddenly and I had to wait for a year for an upgrade for a new phone. Since the game only allows one game transfer (new users beware) I could not use my loaner phone to play in the time while I waited. When I got my new phone, Fate GO was the first game I downloaded, but since my old phone had broke suddenly, I had not prepared for the data transfer and didn't have an ID or password. I contacted support with every known information I could give them. I spent hours on wiki to find every single servant, ascension level, craft and essence card. I knew almost every servant of my party and who was my flavored servant. I did not however know my user name, as it had been over a year. After writing this novel full of every possible thing I could think of to help them retrieve my game, they wrote me back saying that I was SOL. Because I had never spent money on Quartz and I didn't know my username, they couldn't help me. All of my months and months of playing, rare servants and even items I won in events are now gone. I don't even think they tried. This is unacceptable. Not being able to link your account to anything is totally bogus. They do not value their customers. I sadly will not start over again. I spent too long playing the first time and I know I won't be able to get the same servants. I want my game back."

Can you update Mordred's Animation now?
"I am a gamer on my phone. Gacha is in my body and salt is in my blood. I have played over a thousand mobile games. Unknown to RNGesus, nor known to credit card. Have wasted time to play many gachas. Yet these hands never hold anything. So as I pray, UNLIMITED DELIGHT WORKS!"
"if you think i won't reroll until i get alter cu you are very wrong update: didnt get him So, here's a real review. Gameplay is fun and challenging. Some of the controls are weird. and the screen tends to get cluttered. There's some lag due to the huge inages. I want Tiamat to vore me. Graphics are lovely, if sometimes confusing."
Fun and unique game
"Honestly, great game"
"It is my first time playing this game. But unfortunately couldn't play it--asking me to update or download (again?) And, it cannot be played offline. This game is useless...worthless to me, since I don't always have data or wifi. It's just junk in my phone. Uninstalling it."
The gacha system makes me wanna game end myself
"I think that this app is wonderful. It has nice story, incredibly realistic graphics, and easy to understand controls, however, I would like for you to fix the bug. This bug occurs after summoning and even though I've pressed ""next,"" its just stuck there with only the light-summoning background remaining and I would have to restart the app again. Please address this issue, thank you."
Please make the back button
<3Anastasia
Cool Is I
"Explicitly exploitative gacha costs. Ridiculous pricing. Its ok to have low drop rates in gacha games. Ive played quite a few, like Azur Lane, Kings Raid, Brown Dust. But this game... is too much. The price has to be more customer friendly. Its too exploitative. The graphics and gameplay isnt even that good or complex to warrant such a high cost. Ridiculous. Blatant corporate greed."
UmU for mommy
Get a better phone scrubs
Its a masterpiece I really enjoyed it
Best game ever better than ragnarok M eternal Love
Gotta collect them all!
My favorite game out there! I love the characters and story.
This game is awesome! I love it! It's a lot of fun!
best game ever wished it had more event and more crystals to give
I really love this game
Don't be going making holiday events happen long before that Holiday actually comes around and dont even make any form of advertisement for the holiday event if there is only going to be 1 day left of it; it's very rude and disrespectful when trying to get new players. Don't be expecting me to change my review. I'm not easily persuaded when having trash like mentioned above thrown at me.
I wonder if I can reissue my transfer idea?
Clrienz. F.molo
Awesome story. I fell in love with my people
A bit laggy but otherwise still fun
Zenfone 2 cannot run the game :(
The first time I spent quite a good amount for a waifu. One thing I'm disappointed with is the performance gap with iOS devices. The app has bad optimization that an iPhone 6s could have better loading times than a Galaxy S8. Improving game loading time and reducing stutters would help me grind faster. Thanks
"It's very fun, very addicting, great characters, a great story, I absolutely love it."
"It's the best mobile rpg i ever played! The story is deep, the characters are amazing and beautifully created, and best of all its Fate!"
"Used to enjoy this app, but now disliking this game more and more. Just like other people who have reviewed it, I find the rewards for playing alarmingly unfair, and well...unrewarding. Stingy gachas, an abundance of repetitive and useless craft essences, and rude customer service are sapping my enjoyment of this game. I think I'm going to stop playing. The clincher for me was these recent christmas events with Santa Alter and Santa Alter Lily . Basically, I played everyday, cleared all the quests (repeatedly, so I could spin the wheel), got all the enhancement materials from the spins (e.g the Gille de Rais dolls), but the wheel wouldn't drop the silver ticket for the actual hero. Thus, I ""didn't meet the conditions"" to keep the hero. WHAT?! Why doesnt the fact that I cleared the missions mean I earned the rewards, as it has in past events? If getting anything good really boils down to Fates miserly drop rate algorithm, I don't see the point in continuing to play."

Still has some issues a year later but the journey has been fantastic!

"The gotcha rates for the 5 stars are really low, but it's still a lot of fun."
Very fun game with steady content and improved UI. Very endearing writing except for the Septem trash fire. Wish images were higher quality and less pixelated. Overall worth the time.
"Great Game, Great storyline. As a huge fan of fate series, I like it. But I have some things to say 1st up the rate of 4 and 5 star chance and RATE UP DON'T MEAN @!?#"
Absolutely amazing game and addicting with regular updates constant events and awesome animations recommend to all who like the fate franchise
I see Fate I play :)
"First off, you can tell that the instructions, customer service responses, and event explanations are not written by someone who speaks English like most users. The language is often awkward and not in common phrasing that most would understand. The events become increasingly difficult to understand. The stories often don't seem to make logical sense, maybe stuff lost in translation, but even for anime some events just don't make sense. The play structure can be very monotonous."
"Awesomeness in its own right. Would've liked the summon ticket for Jeanne Santa to drop in my instance during her event, though. That said, quests for days!"
Why does my PayPal wants to open up when I loading this game that a huge red flag.
Probably the best phone game that I will ever play. It is just a shame I messed up and forgot the password to get my old save. Love the game.
Wouldn't even load the first few times starting it. Then after it did after about 5 min it froze again and again.
Well i just really miss servant battle and they say this is the legit version
"I'm a fate franchise fan so I may be biased but I'm sure we can all agree that the art and Graphics of this game is enough to warrant a really high quality gaming experience. Well then there's the Gacha with a 1% chance to get a 5* servant, but I guess if u really want that servant so badly. Save up as many Summoning tickets as possible and Don't spend a single Saint Quartz until ur desired servant Rate up. I mean even with terrible Gacha rates, its still a rate up right? (Rate up is a lie)"
Fun game! Way too addictive!
Fun to play
Cool game. Just got ishtar haha
Top tier game
This is a awesome show definitely going to recommend the game :) plus I love the Netflix shows of this anime
it would be 5 star rate if this is playable.. i waste my time to this app but its not playable
"gotta say this is the second game that I've decided to keep on my phone after a few days, Controlls are easy to learn, Graphics are stunning and smooth and has a great story to boot! The only downside is it eats your battery like a kid eats candy."
Padoru
"Men, been a long time fan in the fate series, it be great if they make an AAA game for PC and Console. I will definitely donate money to help with the finances"
12/3/18 I still not get my husband
Slow
Ok nise gaming
Fan of the fate universe
splended
I became a true farmer
I was all right but took a bit to load
"Two things I'd wish they'd do- less revealing outfits for female servants, particularly the children, and more breaks between events! They push content so fast that it completely wrecks the quality."
Best game that I played on mobile :D
Crash on launch
Get ur waifus right here
"Do you have piles of money you wish to burn,countless hours to spiral downwards in a never ending cycle to satisfy your love to your fate waifus that you'll never ever get back? If yes then this perfect for you!"
thanks for great storyline and gameplay
It won't open anymore
Reroll is a must
It's awesome!
Super great AJOM
"I have played this game for around a year now, and just recently had an issue transferring my account. I contacted customer support, and they were extremely helpful. They responded to my email in around 5 hours and were extremely kind and understanding!"
I love being in hell
Putang ina
Great story and skills
It doesn't open on my phone.
"Hi! I'm really sorry to say this isn't working for me. Each time I try to play it and when I click on it, It goes to another game. I don't know if this is a bug or glitch, but please fix it!!"
Do not play!!!
epic
No auto battles.
"This game is so extremely stingy and greedy with their in game currency. While there is no PVP element, if you want good units. You will need to pay and since unlike Azur Lane or Love Live, they don't hand out reward much in game currency."
Pretty sure I have a gambling problem now. 5 stars.
Wants me to do a factory reset just to install and play. I have a Samsung8+ kept getting error 61 saying my phone rooted some how when i haven't. Did research and this seems to be only a problem with the NA install. Waste of time.
Its a great game
I COUNDN'T PLAY IT. I really love this anime. But why I can't play it. It does not even open nor saying a crash report. It will just close after a second opening it.
"Would be great if they were able to link your account with something else like an official in-game log in, that would definitely release me from the fear of losing my account when having lost my phone. Using the transfer code once to get your account back and then if you lose your phone again *poof*, you're never getting it back. Well technically, you could still get it back if you have specific info about your account by contacting with the support centre, and that takes ages for them to respond. I don't dislike the way that the Japanese handle things but it would be better to get a log-in system since this game is pretty darn big worldwide. Pretty good game in general without any big flaws besides the one above I mentioned."
Love this g game
Fun but time taking
It was awesome
Gooooood
cool anime
"Horrid gacha rates, giant cash grab but what's new?"
Please make for Google pixel
"Never really got to play it because it doesn't let me it stays on a loading screen, but I love the franchise"
"Good game for EX-luck people,"
My favorite game.
"It takes too long to start on my phone Mi 8 SE while other games start real quickly. This makes me a bad experience to play. To be more specific, I feel tired and hesitate to play because I have to wait so long. And I usually have to restart again and again because it dont even start. All I see is a dark screen."
you will hate it so much that you cant leave to this game
would go bankrupt for
I just wish it didn't take so much storage.
Nice and injoy have fun
"Yorokobe shounen!! You will suffer the saltiness of not getting waifus and ssr servants!! Btw, nice game it is like a mapo tofu makes you keep playing even if its painful"
I'm happy in this gameüòÅ
Would be 5 stars if the drop rate for summons wasnt absolutely terrible. It really takes away from a otherwise amazing game.
"Overall, it's a pretty good game. The story is lacking for now, but trust me, after E Pluribus Unum, the ball will drop faster than an ice cube in hell."
I was doing a 10x summon but game crashed. Rip 30 saint quartz
I like it so much it's fun
drop rate up is a lie
"Fun, bright, great music, turn based, and fate characters! I love how I can put it down at any time and not miss a turn or a cutscene. (If you can put it down)"
Big boy
Redownloading onto new phone that addicted
Unlimited/10 kek
Great game but jp version still rules <3
Best Fate game
"Truth be told, I would've preferred to see the visual style used in Fate/Extra - especially for battles. Overall the game intrigues me, it certainly teaches players a great deal about the Fate universe."
Nice game I like
Problem is I can't give it a higher rating coz I can't even play it whenever I enter the app it exits
I love it all the combinations and females characters love the graphics
I love the story and character designs of the Fate series.
"Abysmal drop rate for 5 star heroes and 2 saint quartz a week is aggravatingly tawdry if I weren't fan of the series, I'll uninstall it in a heartbeat."
"Game doesn't work for me. I sen't an email but still haven't heard back. I want to be able to send a better review, but for now this is it."
"My account was forcibly stolen because of the archaic and frankly, embarrassing passcode system. When I contacted support l was told that I was out of luck and that they would not assist recovering my account despite me providing evidence down to the Google play purchase numbers and my driver's license. They all together stopped responding to my emails entirely. Very poor customer service. Beware spending money."
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∑‡∏≠
Thanks to support for getting my account back. But I hope they could add the option to link to Facebook or Google account.
The gatcha sucks
If you like the card system done rifht... this is it
"Best gacha game ever, especially because its part of the Fate franchise (and the Nasuverse in extension). While the gacha rates are the worst I've seen (1% rate for a nonspecific 5 star servant), FGO makes up for it by making every servant (yes, even Phantom) that you get practically viable in finishing nearly every quest in the game. Some low star servants have very good skill sets in the game like FSN Cu, David, Billy the Kid, etc. Not to mention the free welfare servants we get in events. This is a permanent game in my phone which I will play until I die or the service ends. üòä"
salt simulator
"Its a great game with great graphics. I just hope the account can be back up like the email so if Transfer ID cannot be use or lost, email can also use for log in. Especially in my case, a friend of mine help me to contact FGO and the reissue is till next 3 to 5 days"
Game is basically a scam when it comes to the gacha. Haven't summoned a gold servant in literal months. I understand it's all luck but the summon rates are actual garbage. Would delete if I didn't put money in it. Story is alright.
"The game is really f2p friendly and all servants can do pretty well in end game content and events. Everyone is useful even a 2* (like Hans). Its a bit grindy but not too much (depends on individual standards anyways). The only flaw of the game lies in its gacha rates. Low rates is bad civilization :3 . You can clear everything f2p? YES , You want your 5* waifu? $$$"
Really amazing game. Would totally recommend. I don't play much card related rpg games but this one is a must play!
Really Fun & Great Story
Fate is just awesome to me
Absolutely love this game!!!
Got a little problem right now. I can't play it because when I enter the game it jump out to the home screen. What happened?
Graphically the best mobile game ive ever seen.
I love this game this is an amazing game I play it almost every single day
You love Fate? DL it
"Game won't even open on my Motorola Z3. Not sure if it's an issue regarding its last update or not, but I'm unable to even try the game at this time."
I really want to play this game again but it says it needs update but i just updated the game pls fix it immediately
Cant play on rooted devices.a big thumbs down
"Its the only mobile game I play, love, and its series is great....not only games but its story aswell and films."
i love the characters in the game
"Somehow lost my account, losing all my 5 star waifus in the process. Tried to retrieve it back by contacting fate go support but all i got was a usesless automated reply. Game is still great...."
Addictive narrative with a good grind must try for any Fate franchise fan
It's better now
A fun game for fans of the series or those new to the Fate series. However there is a bit of a learning curve. And... well... be ready to grind A LOT .
Great game just lacks in pvp
Have a deep wallet for wifus
"Devs, it works on my phone but why does'nt it work on my Lenovo Phab?"
This is a great anime game :)
uwu good game for ppl who is a fan of fate or type moon in general
Super Chill Game!
"Won't work with Xposed installed, disgusting..."
uwu weeb stuff
I like it but need to make harder levels
Amazing story and fun choices but keeps crashing. At least 3xs a day....and drains battery life. Plz fix new to this Fate series :)
It's fun... that's about all I can think to say about it.
"Fun game, with a vast roster of characters."
Good game to play and interesting story
UmU waifus
"This game is incredible. With amazing art, soundtrack, and story-telling using some of the most well-known figures in human history, it will certainly have you hooked. The fandom's totally not a cult. I promise."
Probably the only gatcha game where a one star common unit can be as good as a 5 star in their niche
"I think this is honestly a very good mobile game FOR THE MOST PART. My biggest issue with this game is it's very low gacha rates for ssrs. Another problem is that I feel like the NA version should really start trying to catch up to the JP version. Give us the new singularities faster, more new servants and for the love of God, give the servants the animation reworks they NEED. Overall, great game but there's a lot of room for improvement."
It do doo
"Good game, the gacha is a soul breaking lie."
it's honestly only good if you are already a fan of the Fate series. Drop rates are freaking horrible. it's incredibly repetitive and static in its character strengthening (which also takes forever). You can't really farm enough saint quarts for summoning in a timely way without paying for it. You don't even get enough stamina in a day to do all of the daily dungeons and go through an event at the same time. I would recommend the JP version but I can't fully get into it if I can't read it
"Please up the Gacha rates. And if it's possible, just separate the Craft Essence and servant Gachas. I've got 2 Volumen Hydrargyrum before I even got my first Saber. And it was a 3 star Fergus."
Great way to spend your time if you're a fan of fate
I love fate so I love it
I can't really say that I didn't like it from the beginning
This is a great game that I ever played.
A game for salty whaler
Fun gacha roleplaying game with the whole cast and crew of the Fate series. Only thing that blows is the abysmally low rate to roll 5 star Servants.
This is what happens when Devs actually play their own games!
"Perfect for hardcore and casual Fate fans, this game is insanely addictive. So fun to collect and build your army of servants and bringing them into battle."
Cant even open the app
Characters look amazing
"Game is not translated the best, but they are fixing it. All in all a solid gotcha game with the same gotcha mechanics most gotcha games have. Note to the devs: Give me more free quartz please Q_Q"
I really love it!
The best game ever in my entire life
Please Increase The 5 Star Summon Rate
Pretty noice
Summon heroes and villains from history and fantasy to do battle. King Arthur vs Gilgamesh? Done. Alexander the Great vs Jack the Ripper? Done. Blackbeard vs Thomas Edison? Done. This game is lots of fun.
Its a very fun game which i have been playing for the past 4 years and i am vrry happy what i have gotten done i do hope that they would expand the time limited events
Perfect card game for me with rich story and crazy event
"Enjoyed the Game Quite Nicely, Liked the Combat System, Nice Story"
A good game
Gimme Moedred!
Great game. Gacha and currency for said gacha are pretty generous for a game like this. Constant events and celebrations will keep all level of players engaged and the story line is decently well written.
One of the best games in the app store as far as rpg in my opinion
It's an RPG game from the anime Fate
Great game! Never get bored of it.
Playing this game is one of the things keeping me going day after day.
Really good game
But its ok i guess
"This is a good game, the visuals are nice, there is always new content, everything is relatively easy to get, but the rate ups are a lie though, don't trust the gacha system!"
Making billions for Sony. Would whale again.
Bye bye money
Love it. Gacha is bad Civ
Not sure
Fate Grand Order is a great game that I personally enjoy since I'm a fan of the Fate series. Although there are times where the game is very laggy.
Gacha gods give me strength
Very fun.
"Nice way to pass the time when bored. Is not too demanding in terms of time, and there is no need to pay to play successfully."
It's a fun RPG game.
This is freakin Gacha heavy game
I think this game is the most exciting game i have ever played I LOVE IT
"Lol rate up is a lie. Other than that, this game's great."
Love the series! The game has a great story and the controls are simple enough to understand!
"Hate the gatcha, but love everything else about it."
Enjoyable especially if you're a fan of the series
free 5* pls
"Absolutely a wonderful game, cousin talked me into playing and I'm glad they did because I'm loving every minute of it!"
Historically accurate.
Absolutely amazing love the story
good gameüëç
Unlimited Salt Works
"Very fun for fans of the Fate series. As for fans of story and rpg, I say this is an amazi g game for people who love to grind and work out a team. Be warned, might have to spend a few bucks for good rolls."
"Love this game, really really love it, please bless my gacha rolls :')"
I love the series but the gacha rates are absolutely terrible. I quit the game because rates were terrible and I didnt find the content challenging.
THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRRRüòçüòçüòçüòç
"Great voice work. Battle system is very simplistic, and the art is good as well. Not much on the gameplay front, just a basic PRS. Good luck getting the good servants and craft essences though."
Mash
Big
AWESOME
This game sucks I hate it
I really love FGO it's really-really addicting to play
It's amazing how the characters are.
Time well spent üëç
Ladies and weebs it's almost 2019 and we might die
"Can developers make fate go support the 18: 9 ratio for the latest Android phones, for the current ratio it's very annoying."
I love the fate series and this game is good just like it
Nice gameüòäüòä
I think the game is easy to play and the graphics are awesome. Also I recently got a new phone and forgot to get the transfer stuff so I email the support group. I got quick responses and they were nice and understanding of my situation. Because of them I was able to get my game data with no problem. Thank you for the help!
One Word- umu
So much salt
Please make the five star drop rates a little more doable 50 bucks should have definitely bought a servant separate the craft essence draw from the servant draw
"I play both North America and Japan version of this game, and I really like them. I can say that this is really good, though the progress is a bit slower. It's a fun game overall and I highly recommend it!"
When downloading this is ruined my previous phone. It destroyed my volume settings making me unable to use it ever again somehow. Will not remove this rating until I get a reasonable explanation on why that has happened.
Welcome to salt hell. Enjoy your stay.
okay so 200+ saint quartz for JUST CRAFT ESSENCES thats 200$ for craft essence recommending everyone of my peeps to uninstall
Love the franchise and this game is so much fun for me
"I love the story for this game, but honestly, the rates on the summons is really killing my motivation to continue the game. Five times in a row now I have spent months saving for five star characters I really want, spent hundreds of free quartz and God knows how many tickets on each one and gotten none of them. It has literally been over a year since I have gotten a Servant I was actually trying to get. Half the time when I spend 200+ quartz on a summon to try and get a focus character I'm lucky to even get a single four star Servant. These gacha rates are literally the worst I have ever experienced in any mobile games I have played, especially since the cost to buy quartz is absolutely ridiculous. In short, the story and gameplay for this game are a lot of fun, but the gacha rates are truly abysmal and it really sucks my enjoyment out of the game."

Got all my waifus but lost a few paychecks 10/10 would not recommend
Just lower the saint quartz price please.
Can buy a sportscar on every roll you pay
Won't even properly download....
cu is best pupper
I just have one question. Is this offline or online??
"Excellent game in my opinion. Love the storyline, and fate series as a whole. Its action, humor, and senpai!!! The game team is supet rewarding with saintz quarts (summon material) and generous with maintenace. It might take a,little time and to do it, but its easy enough to get summons without spending money. If you do spend money too its not a bad trade off for price. Over all an amazing game regardless of fate knowledge! Keep it coming!"
It was amazing I played it on my iPod before than it broke so I tried getting on PC it said it didn't support it after it allowed me to download it then I tried getting it on my phone but it never download the extra data it kept exiting the app and blaming it on my cache data
I love the game and it's so addicting once you figure out how to progress and build your team. The support staff is so nice as well when I lost my account and didn't have my account number yet they were patient and helped me out by verifying then recovered it for me.
Thinks
Besr gacha game ever
Easily my favorite game and anime/manga searies
Gacha game that every character matters.
It was fun
Why does it keep downloading everytime I open it? Can you please fix it.
"Somewhat fun game, but it has a big focus on spending money to unlock better characters. Not only that, but if you get a new phone and forget to write down a huge code you will lose your account when you transfer to the new phone. Okay game but pretty unpolished."
"This game is beautiful in the story, graphics, and every part. But I would like an offline version where you can just be able to choose the servants(that the game has assigned OR your own) to help you. Other than that, this game is epic."
Masterpiece but hurts my wallet.
It the best app ever
"The game is really good but it just takes so long to load a single battle/cutscene that generally lasts a minute or 2, I would really appreciate if you can turn off certain functions that would speed this up. Thanks"
Great üòÇüòä
WORST SERVER OF FGO. IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PLAYING FGO BETTER PLAY THE JP VERSION THERE ARE TONS OF GUIDELINES ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY AND EVENTS. DON'T BOTHER ON THIS SERVER SO THEY WILL SHUT DOWN THIS SERVER
Ok ill just start by saying as a person who loves the Fate series this is a good game to play the animations when you attack is smooth well most of the time and the art & animation of noble phantoms are even better but as a player I will say the role % for characters are too low and the cost for saint Quartz are way too high (Just my personal opinion )
It's okay
=)>_<[-o-]IT IS AWESOME but the gatcha is HELLISH
Game will not open on Samsung note 8
"really enjoy this game, it was well thought out, and I loooooove the characters (Gilgamesh ///) And it definately passed time. I on the other hand don't like how it is Online only, but it is definately worth all of my time."
This game is one of my favorite game that I played and the story is based in the anime it self
Very good! I like it the story events and everything. Worth a try for sure
I really really love this game and I hope it stays active in the long run.
Been a F2P player since I started and haven't used a single cent on the game.Really recommend to everyone especially those who are looking for Waifu bait and For Fate fans
"If you love the Fate series, give this a go. Know what you're getting into though because Gacha ain't kind..."
It's all worth going broke over
Cu finally wins
Thanks for the ssr give me gil next pls P.s. no luck november üò¢
Love the game! Astolfo my first 4 star.
It doesn't even work
I gave 3 stars cause i couldnt even get into the game. It load 3% and crash on Razer Phone 2. Looks fun on my brothers $30 Blu phone.. but doesnt work on my Razer gaming phone.?
Not only is the game lacking in much participation from the player but the forced support system is absolutely horrible. Great graphics though.
I wasn't notified that you needed a code in game to keep it on another phone and now I've lost all of my data forever because my phone can't run the game anymore
"It is decent at best. The leveling system stinks, the combat is cool but sort of repetitive at times, and I immediately skiped the cutscenes because of these two words: Senpai and Master. These are just my opinions so you can try for yourself. Enjoy?"
It's a fun game I just wish you people could separate the characters from the essential craft so we can hopefully have a better chance of getting the characters we want
"... game doesn't work on a S7... tried on both my phones. Works on my tablet, but crashed."
Such a welcomed distraction.
Good gatcha for fate fans
GIVE ME SSR PLEs üò≠üò≠üò≠
Loved this game and also the anime series but unfortunately luck isn't on my side and I don't want to buy saint quarts since its too expensive but overall it's a good game with a good plot. Nice character design aswell <3
Really great game but have heard time geting the servants I want so if can be made easier that be cool great story thought
"Great fun, Great Characters and a Wonderful Story."
I have been playing this game for about 6 months and I love it! I log in everyday and can't stop playing love the fate series in general
It is a great game. My favorite servent now is Tamamo Cat.
Good game umu
It would be great if you fix the problem in the phillipines cuz i can't play the game at all
"I have always been a huge fan of this series and this game is just another reason i love it. It has amazing graphics, game play, a range of characters and an awesome story to it. If you love the fate series then i highly recommend you get this game. If you are a beginner to the series of fate this is a great game to start to get a hang of the vastness of the fate franchise ."
most worst gacha system ever
"Waifus may elude you, but the grind is eternal"
"All the characters from the anime, and it's fun I love it!"
Anime girls lol
This game is epic I always play this game.
Why does it not launch when Download is 100 %
"I'd like to rate it higher. It looks nice, plays well, has nice animations. Seems like there's plenty of story. The low draw rate is an absolute nightmare if you really want anyone without spending $100 for them every time."
Best Rpg!
I don't like the. Battle type
I love this so much! I don't care what others think this is the best app I ever played!
"I love the Nasuverse, but the gacha is pretty unforgiving with no way to reliability farm quartz, and the card combat system can be very rng, making it inconsistent unless your team is overpowered."
"Just...boring. Gameplay is boring, graphics are boring, several annoying features. I felt like I was forcing myself to play another stage and that's just no way to live."
I love fate in general so being able to get my favorite people is great and I love the story all in all the only bad thing is I can't seem to get Gilgamesh
Honestly I watch gameplay of it but since the new update it keeps crashing and I know why I'm not running on nox just a normal phone but they blocked nox so some phones can't play aka MINE fate grand order plz fix this I don't know how pc players are at a advantage but by making this update some people can't play and if you are going to fix this plz enable the lg x power also for some reason I can't enter another app with it installed on my phone so yeah if you do see this message plz fix this and honestly just because you blocked one doesn't mean other people can't play on pc there are others that bluestacks emu and others just because you ban one doesn't mean there all banned I hope you can take time out of your busy day to read this and I hope you can make changes to the game to fix these bugs I hope you have a great day or night goodbye.
Doesn't work for my Lenovo K910l
Its great. I'm well pleased.
"It's a fun game, but it needs some improvements. My last 2 phones didn't have a full screen support and had big black bars on the side (iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 9) Also it needs a better account transfer system like Google. I lost my account because I no longer have my phone to do a transfer."
One of the best one player games on the market today.the updates keeps playing exciting.
Gotta get all the waifus
"Where's my 20 saint quartz? You gave me 20 saint quartz for total logins I think (didn't really care about the description). So I was planning to wait until I get 30 quartz for a 10x roll. And then now that I checked, my saint quartz is now 0. As an F2P, I really hate the gacha rate for servants. Like nothing matters, just whale for SSRs I guess? Meh"
Fair enough
FGO IS AWESOME
"ui was awful, but combat was unique and fun"
0.7 would pull again
"Is a really well made game. Is really fun to play, and to pass the time. But it can be very addicting sometimes."
"The only gacha game that doesn't feel like it was made as a mobile game, a lot of investment but the payoff is well worth it. It's simply a fun game that happens to be on mobile"
"I love the game itself but the summoning rates for 5 star and 4 star are ridiculous. A 1% chance for a 5 star and a 4% for a 4 star, at least the login in is great though"
My only problem is dat i cant play dis game i dl it like 5times already but when im gonna play it it close n send error code
"I Love this game. Good graphics, story, and voice acting. Best mobile game I've played."
"Honestly,I love this game. Graphics are good. I would always play this game for a amount of 3 or 6 hours. I would rate 100* stars if that was possible. üòÅ"
This game was worth the wait
amazing story line and amazing graphics!!!
Fix it so I can play with developer options enabled (which is needed for my job) and you get your 5th star
Could not open once downloaded. It kept trying to open my email?? No thanks.
"Roblox ur such a #,$=#in hoe i love it"
I love game coz i'm a fan of fate series
"By far, one of my favorite games"
"I really wanted to play this game because of the anime, but it wont load. It keeps timing out. How sad..."
increase SRR rate please :( and more AP for the low level too
The crashing was the worst. I would have liked to play the game but it wasn't possible. If that could be fixed I'd appreciate it.
I love my characters. I love the story. I love the series. No character is useless. There is no power creep. This is my favorite
The game is great in it's entirety im just extremely dissapointed at the abyssmal state of its account recovery system as in it has none that can be seen formally. I've played the game alot and because I had to delete the app for reasons and because of how long i've played or waited for updates I've forgotten my password that's 2 accounts lost with alot of time and effort spent in it and all thats left is a bitter feeling and a useless identity transfer number.
Pretty much just another point and click game. The story is very lackluster and pointless. Numerous plot holes exist and very little in terms of what is really happening in the game. New challenges that have been introduced show a high level of artificial contrivance that I have heard stories of players who are quite irritated with this game. Can't blame them. This game starts out weak and never really improves. Ignore it.
"Good game and good story, but the bugs introduced with each update mean you may need to reinstall a few times to get it running properly. I recommend getting a transfer number first thing and keeping it on hand"
For the current halloween event I had finished a node I did not obtain the brave liz copy . Is there an error in obatining her right now
Rew
Just being a fan girl
Solid game Great story Hella waifus Not a massive pay to win Only put money into this game if you ready to traverse into gacha hell
Lovely waifus
"Best mobile game ever, awesome characters and fun gameplay"
"Leveling up in this game is sincerely infuriating. While I was playing, I felt I was receiving insufficient experience drops from quests. The drops I was receiving, I had insufficient levels to make use of."
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Horrible summon rate 200sq and no single 4stars unit
Good story amazing gameplay.
Brings back memories of turned based game Zelda. Lotsa eye candy here though.
"Rather expensive if one decides to invest any money into it, like most free to play games, but the game is fairly generous with its in game economy. The writing ranges from brillant to that level of awkward that can only be found from a poor translation of Japanese. It's even fairly accurate in its portrayal of historical/mythical individuals... so long as you ignore all the gender bending. All in all ten outta ten."
Date little bay
"Fun single player RPG experience that constantly updates with new events. Prepare to pay a lot of you want every single servant, but the game is just as enjoyable F2P."
Can you fix the error cannot connect to server ?
Dam I hate the store. Dam quarts a hard to obtain without paying for them
Love this game! It's so fun to play and I love seeing all the Servants I can collect to do my bidding!
Angry emoji
Love the story.
Thank you again see you soon amigo.
"Deep story and silly, 4th-wall-breaking goofiness take turns in f/GO. I never expected a mobile game to give me full belly laughs. Quite generous for-free play, too!"
"If you're a Fate/series fan, it's worth checking out. Main story content is great and free even up to endgame. However, it's hard to recommend outside of that. Plus the gacha system really hampers the fun, paywalling stronger servants and their stories."
Can make a lotta special teams in this game. Fun history lessons thru the power of anime. Umu. Shuten ASMR is best ASMR.
"This is a great game, but sometimes it will kick me out of the game and I have to reopen it. I also feel like there should be a better way to collect saint gems."
I can't even play it
"People complain about the gacha a lot, but this is the best free mobile game I've ever played. The amount of stuff you get and can do for free, not to mention the immense story and cavalcade of characters, more than makes this worth it. That and it has muh waifu."
"Very fun turn based strategy with many ways to combo super abilities, skills, buffs, It has a very interesting story so far with hundreds of unique characters(heroic spirits) to interact with, my only gripe with this game is the luck and crappy gacha system, as you can get duplicates or the same item material more then three times, sometimes special summons are just bait to get you to throw money at it, no, you can save a lot of quarts to spend later so having them saved only for important summons is a must... but that's about all I dislike over all a fun game."
Really needs to stop crashing and trying to send an email when developer mode is enabled. It's really obnoxious and other games don't need to do it.
a turn based rpg set in the fate universe. collecy your favorite historical figures like billy the kid and saint martha. prety fun but be wary of the gatcha system for summoning servants.
Why do i keep playing this kusoge?
Can you plz up the chance of getting 5 stars in the summon
Good game and the best way to relax
Its fun but very slow to load
Is cool I guess
Art design is amazing
Cool game a lot of very tedious mechanics.
Money is gone if it's spent
Every day we stray further from God.
This is a really great game if you look liked the shows you'll love this game!
Pure junk uninstalled
To much like the anime game is great and it's getting better every update...
"Great game, plenty of fun and, support is great, helped me recover my account."
"It's fun, easy to get into, with a clear understanding of real money vs real patience. But not a ton ads or extras trying to get you to spend or confuse you. You even get a decent starter hero to start with"
Fun game with fun events and cool characters.
Wish it had a better link system like Google account or an Apple ID
Very easy-to-access Gacha game in the Fate universe. It's just a bit too pricey for rolls.
Its great and has lots of twist and turns to make things interesting
Yes! My favorite franchise as a game is available in my country! No complaints whatsoever; fair system and amazing story. I only wish that this would be available to more countries in the future.
This game is addicting af
Fantastic Game!
"I Rated 5 stars, Give me Jalter"
Love it a big fan of fate this is awsome
Awesome game love it!!!
Just giving this game what it gives me.
I got helena from 5 different summon tickets from 5 different banners 10/10 would roll for waifu again
"Its a good Fate game and the stories it gives are great. Just wish it was easier to get more Saint Quarts,"
Very fun and addictive.
"Lots of fun, just wish the summoning system was better!"
"Educational? Maybe, if you count the names of the past and the powers do kind of explain what they were in reality- be it their vision of themselves or how folklore described them...for the more 'famous' names being opposite genders, I can't truly back that one up. Though I do agree this game is highly addicting for a time waster and I love the idea YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY MONEY TO ADVANCE~ Just Patience!"
"If ur looking for gacha hell, here is the game made for you"
Best game ever I love the Fate universe and if you do too you should totally play it
I love fate grand order so much
Fun and addictive. ‚ô•
"Awesome game, Awesome story but the gacha could be more benevolent :("
"Super fun all around, might take a few days to really hook you but when it does..."
Generally fun. I like the regular content and events. It keeps the game fresh.
For a mobile game they put a lot of work into it. If you like the Fate Universe would recommend
A fun way to kill time.
Cool Fate related game with rng elements and team building.
My first gatcha game. Haven't spent a dime and I still love it. Fantastic art and animations and a dizzying amount of content. A great game to waste a few minutes or hours with no shortage of things to do. Just pulled the Patron Saint of Salt Jeanne Alter without spending $ too! Highly recommended if you even have a passing interest in the source material or anime or jrpgs.
The loading is to slow very slow
Don't play if you don't have the money
Pure grinding for your waifu. Also depend on luck whether u can Gacha your waifu
I play this game as a good pass time and it has a really good story up until You reach Camelot. Events are also fun too!
"If it's not for the gacha rates, I'd recommend this game."
Good especially if you like the Fate series. Needs a pity system for gacha though. Some servants are outright outclassed by other servants in the same niche and buffs for a couple of servants are very few and take a long time to appear. Nerfs never happen for one reason or another.
Gacha WAIFU simulator 11/10
"TLDR; - The story gets better I promise, Learn to love the grind, You might as well max level those 3 stars cause you're probably not gonna pull that rate up 5 star, and don't play around your conservative grandparents. ******************************* It's nice to play a gacha game that you can do well on even without top tier 5-star servants - especially since the summon rates for 4 & 5 stars in FGO are utterly abysmal. Most F2P (or only occasional purchasers) will be relying on 1-3 star servants, so it was smart work on the developers part to keep even these low rank servants useful even on higher difficulty stages. Combine this with the games system of giving out a free servant to users who complete time limited events that are run multiple times throughout the year, and FGO is very F2P/dolphin friendly. *************************** Early story chapters can lag or just read like nonsense. While dialogue can be charming in places, don't be afraid to click through a characters monologue if it bores you, umu. Thankfully, the story picks up and gradually gets better and better after you push through the mess that is the Septem chapter. ******************************* The gameplay is heavily geared toward endless grinding, and there's No auto feature - so if you rely on that to play, don't bother. (Admittedly, the endless grinding does make it feel pretty dang good to finally max level a character though.) Most early stages can be completed by just powering through enemies, but later stages will start to require players to plan ahead and use skills carefully. ******************************** Lastly, the characters' designs and card art changing as they grow in power is a nice touch. I am, however, frequently left wishing there were a little less mostly naked busty women all over my screen, and no sexualized teenage girls at all. C'est la Japan?"
Thanks for the jalter right before my bday! Best gift ever lolol
"WHY DO I GET CU CHULAINNS ON EVER 10x ROLL GAHHHHHHHHHH other than that, its a great game for type moon fans that'll give you joy and rank E luck at the same time."
God like
"Lore heavy, gacha game"
I love the game and how it functions. I love the way the characters move to the characters graphics
+1 fate lore
Excellent writing and constant shifting mechanics keep the game interesting and fresh. A lot of people whine like wavers about gacha rates but really they just need iskandar to whack their d***s
I just love that this game works well with the show
Waifu simulator with salty gacha. Playing the game without any 5 star is a bit difficult but the rate for any 5 star servant is 1%.
Needs work
Wish type moon made an xbox version
The story of using your loved ones the fight the end of the world.
"New update adds subtitle!‚ù§ Great for Fate fans. There is nothing compared. Happiness or salty, you will experience it with the familiar faces."
Takes long to download when updating
"I really like the character designs even though they sometimes don't make a whole lotta sense. Also, I feel rewarded as time passes when playing whether it's through events, giveaways or whatever else they are doing."
Bad gacha = Bad civilazation
"I get to collect lolis, I'm happy"
Gacha rates are quite bad but otherwise the game is decent
Salt!!!
"This is a game you can play for years. They are always updating and adding content, always improving and making the game that much more fun. The amount of servants you can pull from the summon is so great you'll always be entertained. Well at least I am lol. I've never watched the anime but after playing this game I'm very interested. It's super fun and never comes to a stand still. There is ALWAYS something to do. Side missions, story missions, missions to level up and get to know your servants better. Oodles of fun my dudes. Seriously it's fun. But that's just my opinion lol"
Godly
Great game about collecting your favorite historical figures and using their abilities to beat up monsters.
Great game journeying with favorite charcters
Need more free quartz....
"I give you 5 stars, can I have SSRs (5 stars) too, please."
Give us NP skip button
Yes
"A fun way to waste my time. I enjoy the gameplay, even if it is repetitive and I love the characters."
It ok.
Awesome Game
Best gotcha out there
I hate the biased RNG.
"Stay free to play or be only a dolphin, Don't go crazy with microtransactions and you'll have the best rpg fun of your life."
Saiko no COOOOOOOL
Saltiest gacha game from Fate series
I'm waiting for Mumei to be released.
Better rewards please!
this game will be my first favorite game and the game that i play more than 3 month
"Fun, addictive game I have yet to get bored of! Lots of events and gameplay with a unique storyline. The support is quick to reply and helpful, they really care about what you think."
Hands down my favorite mobile game i've played
Great game be prepared to light your wallet on fire
I would love to play this game again but my phone crashes every time
"Overall a very fun game but the gacha system is so bad that it would be more likely to be struck by lightning than getting a 5 star servant. It's literally at 1% so theoretically you would need to summon 100 times just to get 1 5 star servant and worst part is, it would most likely be a servant that you don't even want. To pour salt in the wound even more is the fact that it takes 30 saints quarts to do a 10x summon and the saints quarts are had to get without paying especially when you beat the game and you're waiting for the next chapter. So to conclude, the game is fun but only fun when you get the servants you want. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are a die hard fan. Extra note: If you think that the devs actually care about all the complaints and think that they are going to fix it.... They won't so it would probably be better to not even complain to them."
"Fans of fate should love this, the gatcha system is really expensive, but I can't fault them for that as you can use the easy to attain f2p servants to win just fine"
Iv'e finally got a jean d'ark alter
"Solid game, hate farming bones though"
I LOVE it
Keep sending updates and adding new features.üòé
It's a great RPG mixing together fate and all the characters into a quite well developed game that isn't too complex.
"Well it gave my notification to clear the cache, then after that popped up every time I tried to start it, it would crash. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and lost all of my data and work I put into this so I'm pretty freaking pissed off."
The character acquisition in this game is atrocious the only way you can actually acquire certain characters. you want is by paying a large sum of money for saint quartz .Even then you might not get the character you want because the craft essence is also in the same pull. Besides that it is an okay game even though its not f2p friendly at ALL!!!
I like everything else except for the pull rates I been try in pull arthur for who knows how lojg but nope no Arthur
"Fun game but it keeps crashing then tellls me to redownload, the loadtime are also a bit exesive between rounds and interfaces"
Amazing game to play keep up the amazing work
Cant access the game using gmail
"This game doesn't run very well on older devices. The loading is painfully slow. And the tutorials are a little pushy. That being said, this game is very fun and addictive."
"Game is fun but takes awhile to grind for acension materials with there was a skip ticket like other games, game force stops sometimes other then that it's a great game"
too much story and not enough game mechanics.
"Good game play and the story is okay at best. Rigged gotcha summons, been playing over a year with only 4 five star heros to show for it. The missions are repetitive and really suck if you summons are berserker heavy and your characters can get instagibbed. Would be a great game if they made some adjustments."
Where is my SSR?
"A Great game but too much grind, little reward and Summon drop rate is horrible."
Its a good game but when it come to summoning for a servant take out the craft essence and put them in a diffrent banner.
"In all honesty, this game is not pay to win, it's obviously still free to play since if you are fimiliar with Fate/GO in any shape or from like the solo's that you will probably see, There are low star servants that are better than their 4 or 5 star counter-parts for multiple reasons. Oh, and the tier lists are dumb, they are based on the current meta most of the time, so instead formulate your own opinions on servants, and look at the tier to see how they see some servants. Wait, this a review, yeah this games pretty good, except the gacha rates are horrible."
"I think it's a great game with amazing graphics and story line. Also, congrats on over 4 million downloads!"
Great to play !
is this compatible for android oreo version????
I can't play. Everytime I go on it loads for like a good 3 to 4 minutes then says I can't get on the servers. I will restart the game and nothing. I will retry the connection and nothing. I even uninstalled and installed again and still nothing. It looks really fun and I would really like to try it out but can't. Is there anyway to fix this.
"I tried with 3 different devices and deleted almost every app over this game, and it still glitched out so bad I wouldn't boot"
It is playable. I love everything about this game. Keep up the good work.
Exceptionly entertaining game with an outstanding support staff!
Awesome game for a fate fan
Good game there is no play to compete with other so you only have to worry about your progress in the game
I enjoyed the preview I enjoyed the preview of the store and I would like and I would like to enjoy the whole game I would like to have an app on my telephone and I and I I would like to enjoy it so I'm going to install it on my phone I want to remove some of the other stuff that I have on it but I don't pick it up up and thank you and have a God blessed day casas de YouTube a WhatsApp
Retarded save game system
They blatantly disrespect the NA server by giving us less rewards than JP and by not making any effort to close the gap
Waifus and memes everywhere. Always remember that the Gacha is bad civilization and to grail the servants YOU like.
RNG Jesus be with you
"Solid story, easy to grasp mechanics, relatively free to play and a solid addition to a very divisive but popular franchise that is brought down by the licensed company.  However, If you played and enjoyed the game, and decided to buy in game credits, you are better off doing so in the original Japanese version which give you better f2p rewards, and rewards newcomers. This version of the game (North America/SEA) has a terrible PR team, gives less rewards as compared to counterparts from other regions and PR/localization team doesn't respond to reviews/questions posed regarding this issues. Localization team also lacks communication with player base, uses outdated social media targets to ""rewards"" players while removing rewards from schedules (read above point) and claims ignorance or uses flimsy excuses to justify such actions. Game devs are basically nonexistent and announcements are delayed or announced in different media while not in sync, causing much confusion. Rewards for new players were distributed early, so there are no initiatives to reward new players who are f2p. If you wish to enjoy the story, translated content is available for free as well. Pay at your own risk"
Please fix the 18:9 aspect ratio........ Such a waste for such a beautiful game
"Your main enemies that you're going to face are Gacha Rates & Words that you can't pronounce, but overall, it's a great game."
It's a fun game and it has a great story.
"One star until I can play this full screen on my S8, hate black bars. A game that makes so much money and they cant provide QoL updates like that tells you all you need to know about this cash grab."
"I liked the game but if you ever uninstall it you lose all your information, regardless of whether or not your on the exact same device."
Where is babylon and the other chapters..
You can get your waifus here.
Games fun overall and is worth getting into if you're a Fate fan or just enjoy gacha games and RPG's. The only thing stopping me from giving this game 5 stars is the poor management of the NA version compared to the games JP counterpart.

"This game may not win you over with its crappy rates, but it'll surely win you over when it comes to its gameplay and unique in-depth story line for both the main quest and bi-weekly event quests. You'll actually feel engaged with the game, as you should, compared to other games where you're only focused on drawing for some meta unit."
A proper FATE franchise game for the fans and also for the franchise newcomers. Simple but stunning graphics with amazing animations and music that all tied within an intriguing original story. It is a gatcha reliant game with plenty of grinding necessary to progress but it is fine since the game is quite forgiving. Don't be mad about not getting that 5-star servant on their rate up banners because the percentage is still really low. Even 3-star servants that are free upon completing a singularity story can be powerful enough to get you through the missions and events if you invest in them hard enough. You will also be granted a random 4-star servant during the tutorial but your mileage with then can vary so it is up to you if you want to invest in that servant or not. Just save up for the quartz and tickets and roll during rate up banners for a higher chance of powerful servants. It is a slow burn but once you build a proper team you can take on any challenge without spending any real money on the game. Just remember that this game can be time consuming so I suggest looking for strategies online to help to play it more efficiently for your time and pace.
Game's great if you can get over the gacha rate of 1% for 5 star servants. The 5 star servants are luxury servants and are not really needed for most gameplay as most 3 stars and lower can fill many of the roles 5 stars can. I am f2p with either crappy or stupidly good luck.
"Awesome, a very good strategy game.The storyline is very interesting.üòé"
Amazing and fun once you get used to it but yous should make it easier to get some of the characters you want
I couldn't download the game. It was very slow. I know is not the phone since it is brand new. I have uploaded other games and they seem to work fine. Don't know what is wrong with this one.
"On my asus zenfone max plus m1 the game doesnt scale fully to my 18:9 aspect ratio screen. Other than that, cheers! Great game."
It's awesome
Very fun and addicting to this game. I can't stop playing it
It could have done more
Knacksterpiece
This should have a better way of farming items its kinda boring having to reap rewards with low drop rates for the basic items you need. It takes too much time.
"This game has the stingiest gacha to be honest, really horrible game managament and yet people still defend it. It deserve better treatment."
Changed to 1 star since my game won't connect at all anymore. Was working just fine a day ago. Now it just refuses to connect.
It is fun to do.
Please give option to skip Noble Phantasm animations.
it's ok game is slow on my s8 plus . devs dont seem to care about that as long as they are making money and no one complains :_
Love this game. Its a lot of fun.
Grindy but fun as hell
"XD, it doesn't work on my device."
"I love this game, it has a great story, nice art, interesting characters, goes for ages so its got so much to love, and has all the special events that really make the game worth it!!!"
"An overall fantastic game. Fun events, fun story, fun characters. Summon rates are low, but every character is usable so it doesn't make a significant difference."
"Tutorial is quick and easy, along with help buttons that remind of each menu's function. Servant affinity is present both in formation and battle menu, allowing for structuring parties if stages are haphazardly entered or for maximum utilization of strengths and opportunities."
The game takes entirely way too long during the loading screens.. My phone keeps locking during gameplay. It's so annoying.. Unistall
The devs are not kind to new players. New players dont get anything to try to help us catch up to people who have already been playing awhile. People decline friend requests because i dont have a max 5 star. Its just a game where if you were there from the start youre golden.
I CANT GET A 5 STAR!!
"Love this game, great story, amazing character, and very addictive"
Has everything you need in a mobile game. Waifus and good gameplay.
"Slow gameplay, same old missions, boring story which doesn't really evolve. A VERY rigged Gacha system the game is more play to win or (grab all your waifus) game. Play at your own expense."
"Great game, my main gripe with a lot of games are that they use chibi sprites. This game has full sprites, full art cards, a ton of servants to get, story and events to keep you occupied and grinding to get your favorite servants powered up."
Game will not open on galaxy S9 +
The only thing I can't stand is when I don't have a lot of data or strong internet I can't get it to load please fix this
Trash game has trash pull rates uninstalled not worth your time don't download
Very slow loading time. Cant wait that long.
Fun and easy to learn gameplay with a very good story and artwork. Easily recommended
"Fun, though there are some areas that DW could improve on."
"Mediocre gameplay, horrible gacha, shoddy writing. Only reason to play it is for waifus and husbandos. Anyone wanting a decent game should look elsewhere."
They have the anime They have the game They have my life
Very well thought out and likable characters with a well thought out storyline.
Great if you are a fate fan but beware of the rng gacha.
It's Great.
The biggest salt mines there is. Mounds and mounds of salt everywhere
"Game is good and even better for fans of the Fate series. The grinding or farming might make casual players quit early because it is intense especially in late game. Requires strategy also so auto feature will not happen unless they think something with macros. As a Fate fan, 5* from me."
"Great game if you're into grinding, great art design, the battles are fun and animations are beautiful"
I very much enjoy everything about this game expect for the gambling system.
I like the characters from history
"My favorite mobile game to date. Fun, strategic gameplay and a great story to boot. The gacha rates can be brutal at times, but overall, I really like it. Just remember, only spend what you can afford to lose."
"I was never an avid fan of the Fate series, but this game absolutely has me hooked."
"I love the game, but I broke my old phone and can't retrieve my old data through transfer, so if you could help me some how retrieve it, that would be lovely. Love the game and tbh don't wanna grind all the way back."
"Amazing, can't wait to spend more money to summon 5 star servants that may never come, oh well, it's still a great game XD"
Once game downloads clicking the game icon attempts to open your email client. Immediately uninstalled.
Perverted weeby trash..
It's great I got to meet my waifus and alter versions plus I kick a lot of butt
"If you're like me then you started to play the game to know about the characters of the Fate Universe. It's a very addictive game. The storyline is worth the journney, but I just wish there were easier way to get Saint Quartz."
Semoga Dpt Mordred Dody Ngentot
Another game made to milk you for everything that you worth.
This game is addicting for fans of the anime.
Any idea why the samsung note9 stylus pen doesn't work ingame? Great game overall and awesome customer support.
"FGO has two things going for it so far: story and mash kyrielight. The story has kept me interested Otherwise, the UI is needlessly complex, the game has far too many and far too long loading screens, the ingame engine looks wonky with the 2.5D display, and the camera is hyperactive to the point where even a seasoned Wipeout/redout/f-zero veteran gets motion sickness. Overall probably 7/10"
fate is amazing
Love the anime. Like the game.
Fuels my addiction of the gacha roll
RATE UP IS A LIE!! But overall the quality of the game is decent. Theres no real heavy power creep so if you play stop then return you wont be left in the dust. Well besides Merlin but thats another story. Overall the gameplay is strong but i wish there was autobattle but i guess its unique in that it feels more like an actual rpg cause you have to grind everything out.
Type-Moon!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è!!!
Waifu ain't no laifu
Good game super cool i love it really good aniplexüëç
I give 5 stars if you give me Astolfo
good narrative
"Hero collector based in the universe of Fate/stay night. Gameplay is very good; a kind of stripped-down Valkyrie Profile with considerable tactical and strategic depth. There's also plenty of content, including a meaty and still growing story campaign, frequent events, and well-written (though occassionally overlong) cutscenes. Having said all that, this is still a freemium game, with the usual annoyances: gatchas for new characters, multiple grinds to level them up, and stamina meters. Also a banal ""friends"" system which doesn't add social interaction but allows you to trivialize battles by borrowing some random whale's five-star. Definitely worth trying; whether or not you'll like it depends on your tolerance for freemium nonsense and your enjoyment of the franchise as a whole."
Love the anime franchise and love the game
greatest addiction
"No one has helped me get my account after losing it, its been a week since I sent an email"
It is really adictive
"Great game, very entertaining, until you lose your game data. No recovery."
A gift to the World
"They need to fix there freaken card drop system, I've been trying to get saber alter for a year now, passed chapter 2 so I know I can get her and have gotten mostly craft cards and today was a pick for saber alter or saber herself so I thought I'd get at least one. Nope got 1 3 star saber I already had, and the rest was craft card. And I can't help feeling skipped and it pissing me off!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Best game ever!! Medusa is my waifu!!
"The gacha is rigged, the gameplay is ok, the plot is boring, and the riyo comic is the best thing about f/go. I love it"
If you put in a five star astolfo then this review will be five stars
"The absolute BEST Fate game for mobile! Tons of servants to choose from for your arsenal, a unique story, and for longtime fans of the series, the lore of each servant remains!"
If your a fan of the fate series you gonna love this game
Inspiring ;-;
Amazing Game!
Only complaint with this game is the loading times aren't that grand.
I got scathach!!!!!!!!!
"Fate fans will definitely appreciate this if they're willing to overlook some weird off-character moments for the known servants and weird directions for the FGO exclusives. Great writing for the singularities, events, and interludes bar the first few chapters. It's criminal it hasn't yet grabbed and kept the number 1 spot on top games outside Japan."
Game hangs on startup on S9+. Gets to 5% on the update screen then just stops downloading. Tried multiple times with different networks.
This freaking game forced me to clear its cache saying it wouldn't delete my save data. And after I followed it stupid instruction I lost everything. Stumped game needs a freaking login system ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
This is the go to game for anyone who is a fan of the Fate series as well as anyone who loves history
A lot of waifus
Fate is great.
I can't play the game the game crashes Everytime I tap the game
Very fun game.
"Really addicting game, art is really good and the gameplay is the most unique I've ever seen"
If the summons are a bit more balanced mainly the saint quartz one and lack of AP I would change this to a five star
Please change the CLEAR CACHE at the start while loading it's very irritating. the You MIGHT GET CONFUSED From Connection Retry... Downloading takes awhile even if you have a fast internet. Time is wasted Damn you Delight Works.. Bad UX..
Great game over all.
Takes 45 min to load terms of useage required to much in 3 trys ; 3 days it opened
If possible i would like you to add Semirames as a servant
Very good game. I love the portrayal of these people from history and mythology in a fantasy setting.
Lost my jap account gave the devs all the details and they told me we can't get it back... Then they told me please continue playing. Wow
"Don't like gacha, but the gameplay is fun and you can ignore the gacha and play free if you're patient and smart about it."
Constantly launching Gmail each time the device restarts because it's used as a development device and that's not allowed for some reason even though other applications don't care‚Ä¶
I like it. It is a game
Won't run on a stock Galaxy Note 8.
"Good game, but plagued with some of the worse gacha systems out there."
"The moment I played this game, I was already addicted. This game will take your soul and empty your wallet because of the gacha."
I would love the play the game. I've seen my friends play it and I love it! I'd love to play and spend time in this game. I've patiently waited for whatever to be wrong to get fixed because I cannot play on my galaxy s8? I've sent emails about it but I haven't seen any change. Maybe in the future this could be fixed so I can actually play.
"Games good, drop rates for for accession items are trash, did the rider 40 ap quest 15 times didnt get a single rider monument"
I cant even play it it keeps taking me to Email I'm using my phone so I deleted it plz fix it
"If I have to pay instead of investing hundreds of hours to receive a good experience in the game, I think this is a deserving score."
"Gacha is heavily in support of p2p, and leveling characters takes a lot of grinding, but battles are good, and have a strong basis on strategy"
I love how the game works and how easy it is too bad that we can't challenge other players in this game
"Love this game. Have been playing this for a year and have been a fan of the fate series, but there is one porblem. If you're reading this, fix the sound bug for android please because it is so bad when I move from IOS to android üêß"
This game has been crashing since the new event started. Please fix.
God i love fate series
"This mobile game has one key feature that sets it above and beyond other mobile games: storytelling. Backed by the anime, visual novel, large fandom and other games, the Fate universe is an enjoyable place to dive into."
This game is a lot of fun for those who like to play JRPG's type of games and like to grind to level up and improve your characters you control.
Its a gotcha game with the fate anime and manga characters cool but the animations in fights is just terrible like the original adventure quest game ... Its not up to today's standards or the standards of 5 year's ago.
"Utter trash, took 4 hours to download. Upon which it said ""there was an error with the cache"" causing the game to need to be re-downloaded."
Can't even launch
After it loaded it would say application did not open correctly
Wont play on my device so dissapointed....
"I can't play it, it crashes when I try to open it"
2 words LOVE IT
The hntai was pretty good so this is nice too.
New update is broken. It does not work on wifi. Only on phone data connection its not an issue of my internet wifi cause all my other apps are working just fine.
"Pls help. I accidentally deleted the game and forgot to bind it. Pls help me recover my account, i do not want to start all over again"
I've been redownloading the clear cache data for two hours now and it restart when I reached 90%. My internet is perfectly fine 8mbps but downloading for a 1% takes me 5mins?
...still can't update the game...
Great game. But could use s9 plus optimization
It would be better if you exit the game in any way you like and not telling you to clear the cache because the game did not open properly and it sucks how you have yo redownload the game. PLEASE FIX THIS JAPANESE VERSION DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE REDOWNLOADING.
"This game is a simplistic boring grindfest with outdated graphics and no pvp that I'm aware of. No idea why it is so popular, there are much better turn-based, character building and rpg mobile games out there - such as Summoners War, SWG, Alliance Heroes Spire, Alchemists Code and others."
"I've played the game for about a year maybe slightly more, but this Last MAJOR Maintenance delay causing me to miss my normal opportunities to keep my consistent daily log in streak coupled with not being able to advance in the main story as I'd like due to a lack of sufficient Experience cards from the gacha drops ( Which I always felt was a flaw with the game) has truly taken away the enjoyment I had for this game from when I first started playing. I'm still a fan of the Fate series itself but not the game anymore. I found myself just grinding on the limited event storylines just to collect all the exp cards and even then the gap in exp cards to gainable levels for my team still was just too much to enjoy the main storyline. Then there is the gachas that refuse ""regular saint quartz"" and will only accept ""paid with real money ONLY saint quartz"" I never had a problem paying and playing for a micro transaction but just the Audacity of it upset me when there was still the chance of not getting all the characters you wanted from one of those gachas for a price of a estimated $20 to $30 of real money that's ridiculous."
Great game it would be nice if it had some kind of auto mode on levels you already beat
It was lit
It ok
I love the series
One of the best games I've ever played
"The gacha gods are cruel but game play is great, graphics are great, the fanservice gets a bit much sometimes but that's my only real complaint . Definitely worth a download. Plus fun events to keep things interesting!"
I can't even open the game. It just tells me to send a message to developers.
"A fun game. Especially if you like the Fate series. There's a lot of fun to have with getting your waifus and husbandos. But the events are just too taxing in my opinion. They just keep coming and made it hard to focus on the actual story. Characters are great, I do wish they were a bit more balanced sometimes. Farming for materials gets old really quickly, especially for Hearts. In the end, I uninstalled because the game just took too much of my time away from me. I got addicted and it was unpleasant."
I love the servants
I can't load in. And I am sad. üò≠üò≠
Be careful not to delete the app and reinstall; you can transfer data to a new device but there is no way to recover a save.
"Interesting take on the universe, regret deleting the first time."
Lost my account after the update
"The game is addicting and a lot of fun. My only real concern is your selfishness with 4 star and higher summons. I'm unsure WHY you guys refuse to guarantee a 4 star or higher servant on a 30 draw. The number people need is significant enough to properly boost their servants and so many different servants that it shouldn't be a big deal. I can almost 100% guarantee if you added a guaranteed 4 star or higher servant instead of 3 star in the 30 draw, not only would your players be happier, but you would make even more money than you are now. No other game I have ever played has been as selfish with their drop rates as this one, even Kingdom Hearts Unchained which is pretty greedy is more forthcoming with drops including a guarantee for most within a certain number of draws."
The game would have been better if the gatcha wasn't salty and cold as the Pacific ocean.
"This game is meta changing so there's a point you have to waste money, but chances of pulling 5 star are slim to none. Plus this game never guarantees anything. At least guarantee something for those who spend money."
Good time dump and we'll crafted RPG for a mobile game
"This is one of the few games that rewards you for knowing how to handle challenges, and doesn't make you feel bad for using a friend's servant. Unfortunately, the maintenance fiasco screwed a lot of players over, and the compensation doesn't justify supporting let alone playing the game anymore. I lost all interest after I lost my streak, and the quartz gave me stuff I already have."
Jack the Ripper is a loli...
Like the game and work that's been put into the art but just wish the quartz wouldn't be so hard to get so there would be an incentive to summoning more often. Only the quartz though so the great feeling of getting a five star wouldn't be lost. üî•
I like how each character is unique in their own way.
Pretty good üéÆ game
"I really love this game, but it keeps lagging and crashing. I've seen my friends play and it runs so smoothly"
I love this game its so addicting!
I've loved this game since I found it but this last update being held hostage by Apple is very aggravating
SUGOI
Is so good
Pull rates are bad otherwise not a bad game
"Good story, good characters, and addictive fun. Awful gacha rate though."
Still waiting for the game to be working
"I haven't spent a cent, and have 2 5* units + several good enough 4*s. Its enough to play :) I get bored easily and I've been playing this for almost 3 months, so they're doing something right"
Fun game with an interesting storyline. A bit of luck needed + high level friends on certain missions but not a huge problem. The game doesn't require you to spend cash to play so that's always great.
10/10 Although I'd like a bit more SQ.
Best mobile turn based RPG
"My only complaint atm is this extended maintenance! I'm ready to drop $50 to try to get Nero Bride and y'all won't let me...ü§î On another note, (this is more for Google play) I wanted newest comments first and the newest comments are not there. Why have the option of you won't deliver? Imma play x-com 2 until this gets sorted out. ü§òüññ‚úå"
Give us more QUARTZ !!!
The characters are Epic. The story Awsome. The Gacha NOT WORTH IT! Don't waste your money do your best to enjoy the game with out buying quartz.
"Maintenance is a fiasco, compensation for triple extensions on server downtime are less than worth it. This far outweighs anything good I had to say about draw rates and gameplay as the game has been down for 12 hours with no signs of coming back online any time soon."
Its good over all but after recent update ive been unable to play it jus ssys mantnice has been extended even tho that was like 6hrs ago
When does the extension end
I can participate every Grail war
"Great Game! Animation is great, character design is great, game mechanics is great and the story line is great! However the gatcha rates are not nice :'( but considering the free SQ and other stuff the game is kind of generous... Kind of... But overall the game is really enjoyable :)"
One of the BEST free games out there.
Yesn't
Nice Graphics
"Wait, what? Can't launch with USB debugging enabled! Are you delusional? Surely your developers understand Android's permission model, at least vaguely. We can't debug your app unless the manifest says so. Sheesh!"
A nice way to enjoy the fate series
Love the story so far
I hope the english team continue to bring us this amazing game! Thank you!
Just like what you expect from a game that use RNG. Very low chance to get something decent while the story force you to fight mob above the safe level. 3* servants facing against Vlad with his vampirism. Please at least increase the drop rate for 3* servants and not only for CE.
I rate it 5 star if i get 5 star servant lol
A Masterpiece Good job Nasu
"Gacha will leave you with blue balls if you're fixated on pulling that one waifu/husbando during the banner pools. All salt aside, honest opinion. I never would have been captured by a this game so easily. - If you're a fan of the fate series, I would say it's worth checking out by itself. - If you like turn based games, lore, special appearances. I would recommend it. - The F2P choices available is fairly good surprisingly. - Pleasent grind in most aspects."
"Worst kind of game. There is no way to get anything you actually want out of it without relying on a ton of luck or spending a ton of money. Even if you do spend a bunch of money you still get to live with a 1% drop chance. These kind of ""loot box"" games need to disappear from the market as they are designed from the ground up to be predatory and go after people that are addicted to gambling and people with poor impulse control that think that maybe next time they will get whay they want from the loot table. As a result in spite of being a fan of the fate properties I can't recommend this 'game' to anyone."
"This game is awesome and I recommend it to everyone! I think there should be more historical accuracy with the Heroic Spirit's, but besides this small detail its excellent."
The devs have no interest in allowing this game to run on Chromebooks. A pity since it looked like it might be fun.
Great game enjoyable and new content at an acceptable pace. Not too slow that people drop it like my friends in the early stages. Caution drop rate for 5* abyssmal.
"Would be better if NA gave us all of the Quartz JP gets, instead of just 1-3 and 10 quartz for the anniversary."
fate!!
The game wont open in my phone
"Well,the best game for fate fans"
"The RNG is a bit like you'd expect from a gacha game, if maybe just a little skewed towards failure, but that doesn't mean that you can't beat the game and have fun without the best of the best of characters around. It's a really fun game with memorable characters and a pretty good story, and I think even those who don't know of the Fate franchise can find some fun in this game."
"Connection problem?Maybe,but on your side because my side is fine.This was not the first occurrence,but now it's the last."
It is an amazing game if you love the Fate series
"I like that it is a mix of human history, religion, action and fantasy. It is a fantastic RPG game in history."
Super slow download [Note 8]
"Good game, gatcha rates suck, but good game."
By far one of the best games on play store only issue is there probability chance of getting a good item. They need to raise the 5* drops from a 1% chance to atleast a 3% or 2.5% Cause ive stimulated the tare drop rates to be at .0035% of a 5* servent
RiP Wallet
Don't bother spending a single cent. You wouldn't get anything out of it.
Make sure to drink a lot of water for all the salt you'll consume.
"So I like the game to a degree but the main currency in the game is called saint quarts Crystal's and as someone coming from bleach Brave souls I expected them to be somewhat easy to get like maby 1 per mission but instead this game makes you gripe the same mission usually atleast 3 times just to get one and by the time you have grinned and gotten like 3 Crystal's tour all out of the in game energy so you can play anymore unless you spend one of the Crystal's tou just grinded for to contine,and the fact that it takes 30 of these to do 1 times 10 summon could take you days to get enought.and then when you do chances are you wont be rewarded with even a 4 start much less a 5 star and if you do get a 4 star it will most likely be a character you already have so their goes the past however many hours you just grinded to get one 10 times summon to get."
Anything for the Dragon Idol!
please help me recover my progress so i can continue plating the game again fgo is outstanding
"Doesnt even open, tried 3 times uninstalling and reinstalling and also restarting my phone"
I already emailed support about my problem and already did the fix they sent me. Still can't play. Bad experience.
This game is fan-tucking-fastic!!!!!!
BACK BUTTON PLS? I KEEP FORGETTING TO BUFF
It wouldn't even open despite downloading and downloading it numerous times.
This made me cry
"Didn't work at all on my current phone or the one before, and both are very modern in terms of tech."
Fun game. Probably the best mobile game in terms of gameplay.
You guys REALLY suck balls - Don't you.
My favourite game.
"For some strange reasons, this is the only mobile game that keeps me investing tons of money and time on it. It makes me feels like I'm part of chaldea. There's no turning back for now.. I've to save the world!"
"It will install, but won't run. It directs me to my email to solve the problem."
I love everything about this gameüòé
"I love this game so much, it's great and addicting."
Collect all your favorite FATE characters.
A MUST PLAY game
Speed up animations further. Unnecessarily long time to complete even the easiest stages.
I install the game but cann't play. I'm using zte z11 android 7 :(((((
"The best thing about this game is how friendly it is for free-to-play users (and how much it punishes paying users, ha). You can spend hundreds of dollars and not get your favorite 5*. You can also go in F2P and grail (a type of limit-break system) a free 1,2, or 3* servant to level 100 if you wish, allowing any unit to become powerful. That's a definite plus!   Events frequently give out tons of rewards and unique, free 4* servants that come in 5 copies, but there is heavy playtime involved. If you're into games that reward invested time with a sense of pride and accomplishment (really) then dive right in."
"Requires way too much space, no options to lower settings for older phones. Combat is mindless, and to top it off the gacha is as annoying as any games, but it doesnt make up for it in other areas like other games try to"
"Incredibly addicting and great gameplay! If you're a fan of the Fate series, then you need to check this out!"
I used to be scared of hell but then I experienced this game's gacha system
Its a good game for a great franchise
Not bad.
"Tbh im not sure if i would recommend it to someone who doesn't know about the Fate series, but it is overall a pretty fun game"
Doesnt open
A good FTP game
maintenance time too long need to compensate
BEST GAME EVER!
Doesn't work on Android 9.0
everything of this game is amazing
I think the game is great but give us more saint quartz
Gacha is life
This game is really fun. The only problem is I seem to always fail in gacha in servants but in craft essence wooo boy
This game is the pinacle of both intelletual combat system and casual button clicking .
One of the best games I've ever played I hope we have some more in the near future
"It's a nice game, but for some reason Everytime I open it it downloads data, even if there are no updates. Is there a way to fix this or anything? My data plans are depleted for just one game session. Even if I select no when clearing the cache it still redownloads data."
"The game is good overall but the gacha is so depressing... you collected quartz over the months but when it comes to the gacha roll with your favorite servant, you'll cry because your friends got it but you on the other hand is staring at the ""0 quarts left"". BTW i have a bad luck in the gachas .... save me"
I live
"God, i love this game"
Awesome game!! Although it would be a better if NA is as generous as JP server. Haha!
"I fell behind on the prisma event. On the last day I sat down and played for 13 hours straight. 1 Chloe. No ascension, noble phantasm level 1. She collects dust with my poor Kintoki now. I feel nothing but disappointment."
It's an awesome game
Wish that you would use the re-run versions of the events since the original versions were just tedious.
I keep feeling the despair in gacha :/
I absolutely love the gameplay and the ascension mechanic encouraging grinding to get materials like any good RPG. I do not even mind spending a little money for some extra Saint Quartz. I'd give the game a 5 if we could level up servants through combat and not just through combining them with other cards
It's an awesome game just got to be careful of rolling for the servants you want. It may not go the way you want it.
"Please be generous on giving out quartz for f2p players, i think by that you will gain more players and popularity."
Over all good but it does glitch quite a bit
worth the download.
I like it.... is very good..... very atmospehric
"Never got to play it. Installed to my SD card, but it keeps trying to download all the extra (2gb) of files to my phone storage. I love the game idea and pitch, but I'm not deleting two gigs of things I actually use from my phone storage just to try a game that can't even install and download correctly."
This is really a waifu mobile gacha game üòÇ
loading time is so bad couldn't even play it took over 30minutes to download updates then took so long to load the tutorial I gave up on it connected to high speed internet too
May the Gacha be with you.
"I like this game. It's like a mix of visual novel and turn based RPG. Story gets more interesting in the later campaign such as Camelot, from what I heard."
I downloaded 4x i cleared the temporary cache 4x but everytime it goes to 80% it crashes!! What a freakin waste of time and internet!
"Its alright.Having low chances is usually a staple of gatcha games,yet fgo pushes it WAY too hard."
"Would love to play it and see how it is, but apparently it's not compatible with the latest Android update."
As a fate fan this game is awesome.
Very good RPG in the Fate series. The battles remind me of Fire Emblem.
A great game
"I wish there was a bind account before I uninstalled. A whole year of progress disappeared. Other than that, this game is fun... If you can get past the fact that its a grind fest"
"I want to give this game five stars, but it refuses to work. I'm stuck at the character select screen and I can't get out, every time I try to re-install or clear cache I keep running into the same problem. Aniplex can you please fix this? I really want to enjoy this game as much as possible!!"
Make more fate last encore
Too expensive to play. I prefer playing the game Brown Dust. That game gives a generous amount of gems to players.
"This game is amazing. However, they overly sexualize the female characters. It's definitely not a game for children. The battle graphics are great, the characters are refreshing. It's super addicting."
"My phone went kaput recently, so I desperately requested a transfer code...and was sent the wrong one. I've lost over a year's worth of good luck to an incompetent and unsympathetic support staff. All my progress gone. Why can't we have a login and password so we can easily move to any device? Whatever. Farewell, FGO, you taught me not to fly too close to the sun."
I love this game but I hate how Japan gets everything 10x better than us while we get almost nothing like on the nerofest annoucement ... 3 saint quartz for 33k likes? Really now. If you're free to play go play the Japanese version and dont suffer like us
GREAT time killer
It's a good game challenging yet simple. U can use ur friends characters to help you through but be alot better if it had a way to save data to Google or Facebook would be great it's to easy to forget about transfer code
"Great game, and addicting. Great gameplay that isn't too much for a mobile game like most out there now. Easy to learn mechanics as well. Best game out there in my opinion."
Amazing game for Fate fans
Thank you for creating such an addictive and story heavy game!
"It an okay game, it crashed twice on me. Once while I was looking at what I had summoned to my team and second time while I was battling and that was during the second battle. So before I reinstall it back on my phone, please fix the problem. I really love the game though."
It's a good time killer that has fun lore and a good story
"It is a nice rpg but it lags pretty bad on my phone, I don't know if it doesn't work well on older phones or what, but it needs an update for that."
Can't even open the app on my Galaxy S8
"Can't stop, won't stop playing this amazing game!"
Slow download
Its awesome!
Ez game
"This game is fun but the support team is not helpful at all. I might say not helpful in some situation.You must be on your A-game to play this game because if you don't, you will mess up. If you screw up, the support team WILL NOT help you in anyway. They will say ""Sorry, it's your own fault that you screw up"""
The heck i dont know what to say but... The new updated of this game is so frustrated i download it so many times üò¢üò¢
I love this games Im waiting for the next update all servants animation update
It crashed my tablet upon start. It doesn't work.
Bad just horrible a really big disgrace
I really like shutendouji
"Great game, bad gacha system"
"Why make it available if i ""Can't play under current conditions"", if that means anything"
"Nice game but english need hardwork to get quartz than japanese version, the rewards are lesser as well as the .1% 5 star is so hard to get..need money..which is quiet annoying and dissapointing..you have a lots of 5 star any way why don't you add 3% to get it. thats all thank you."
I AM THE BEST.
Will this game ever get autoplay or anything even close to that?
It's great but if Astolfo was better then it would be perfect
Awesome thanks ü§¢
"I love the game, just got it recently. But it closes itself too much and is very laggy at times. Also takes a long time to load. I would also like more summon options"
Xiaomi mi 8se load r·∫•t ch·∫≠m.
Great Game very fun Waifu's applenty
"It's a great game, very addicting"
"I really enjoy the game, it can get a bit heavy on grinding but I still really enjoy it. The update made it so they couldn't detect my WiFi but at least they've fixed that a few days later."
Lancer ga shinda
"This games great I've played the jp version as well. However with event, the second part of the missions that came out today im having trouble they say their completed when i tap to collect the reward it comes up with an error message. Can you please fix. Green bar not up and does show what you need to go."
I played this game as a f2p since day 1 and I only have altia pentdragon but at least I have siegfried to carry me.
The PRIME example of a predatory mobile game. with 1% ssr rate. You literaly have to spend hundreds(if not thousands) of dollars to get the new unit you want. Free currency is scarce as all hell - the worst in the business. Stay Far Away.
"When i finished downloading it I opened the app and things were fine, but when i connected to another wifi source it wanted me to download again"
Love this game and the series itself. The first Fate/Stay Night was my very first anime and it saddens me a bit that only a few of the original characters are good servants to have. Fate's poster girl is not even that great of a servant... I'd love if it there was an event based of the original fate anime not just Fate/Zero. But all in all its a good game.
"Awful drop rates, awful AP recharge the higher you level. Nothing but a cash grab. What's up with all the sexualized children? Not cool!"
Cool game and story but make rates higher the chance of pulling a 5 star is too low
It was very fun
"Long tutorials, no auto battles, takes too long just to take control of the game."
"A really great game that does base heavily on your money spent. Some 3/2‚òÜ servant is much better or have equivalent power to some 5‚òÜ servant. It also take your skills to the test on how you can win a battle or survive it. It's a turn-based and strategy game btw. In terms of events, it doesn't matter if you didn't even watch/play the Fate franchise as the events does not or have a little part on the event. This game take hours, days and years to have a full working team."
"Joined the day it released. Huge Fate series fan. But the currency is a pain to earn and save, and they started releasing gatcha you can only play with BOUGHT currency. What a slap in the face."
"I spent a good amount of money on this game, got busy with work and school, got a new phone, and now cannot log in. I'm down to spend more money but I need access to my account again. Will keep the one star here until resolved."
Gimme me better servant plis .. TY :)
5 star is can grail mashu to 100
"The game is good, but if you need support good luck with it. Been waiting for almost a week now and still no response. They should really add social logins so when playing on multi device, you won't risk losing your account!"
The one thing i didliked about this game was the ap it takes too long to replinish but besides that i love this game i play it too much lol
"Nowhere near engaging enough to warrant the time investment it necessitates. The writing and visuals aren't bad by any means, but the gameplay, while engrossing at first, quickly loses its charm once you recognize you'll be making every small decision during every small fight. If this process was streamlined, and battles could be automatically fought to some extent, then maybe I could see myself playing it again."
"Do not spend a penny in this game!  Once your account is lost, customer service would not even try to be helpful to recover your account!"
"It's a great game, but after the 1.20 update the games loading times doubled. If they can fix it this would be a five star game!"
"I love the Fate universe this game really helps fulfill my fandom with having all my favorite characters, the game did take away my beserker lancelot though but I still love the game i believe they made this with the thought of there fans and I'm happy to go on my own Fate journey with my servants. üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ"
The struggle
Its a great game and the story is really interesting that it motivated me to wait for the two f/go movies. At first the gacha might be frustrating but once you get a good servant its really worth it. The game is also a lot deeper than what you see there are tons of combinations for your lineup.
Advice give this game a link to a email instead of a transfer code less ppl will lose there accounts
I uninstalled the game because it started to mess up my phone. I can't get my account back even I linked it. Can Google play do anything to help? I really liked the game and i even emailed fate go support. Can you help maybe with some of the information of my account?
I like the the game. The graphics are pretty decent and the game play is fun. The story is great. But Everytime I launch the app it says it didn't launch right and I have to install the game again. Please fix this. My phone is a Blu life one X3. Don't know if maybe that's what's causing it.
I love it I just want my murdered
It is a very exciting game for everyone
Doesn't work on my Android Tablet
my low end phone cant handle it
The current event is broken for me I can't advance past the second battle other then this I really enjoy the game
it bad
"I think the game is fantastic. Team composition building is fun. Events are enjoyable and comedic. However not a game for the light of walet. The gacha chances are abysmal for the favorite and best servants. And some issues concerning balance, making certain support servants mandatory."
I love the series and this game!
It does not support full screen on pixel 2 XL which is a big problem to play with a big black screen on the sides
"Finally, the game is now compatible with Android 9, just in time for the new event! The compatibility issue shouldn't exist in the first place, I waited 2 weeks for this and everybody unfriend me in the game. But that's fair enough, now I can play with Illya lol."
"Cool game! It's really addictive, you should play this game if you're fans of Fate series!"
No Android 9 implementation
"Now works for Android Pie and is just as wonderful as before, thank you!"
"Games fixed, and just in time for the new event."
Great graphics and good luck to the creators
It's not terrible
Crashes at launch s9+
"Game is good, though if the devs could make saint quartz cheaper that'd be great but it's their decision so... overall it's a great game!"
"Love the Fate universe, it's great to see characters from the anime like Sabers Artoria and Mordred and Nero, as well as other beloved characters like Jeanne d'Arc and Hans Christian Andersen. The game is thrilling from the easy to understand gameplay, to the complex strategy and class compatibility, to the amazing storyline/plot."
Gacha hell in this game is the worst.. wants you commit suicide..
"As of August 23, 2018, the game keeps on failing to load properly. ""Failed to connect to server."" My internet is working fine, and I have tried opening the game on different mobile networks and Wifi but it still fails to connect. I have also tried using the option of the game to clear cache, but it still wont work."
Best mobile game I have ever had.
"nice game, addicting event, awesome drawings"
"Recently my phone (stock android 7.1.1) bugged up and I had to reset the device to make my phone work whilst being new to this game, I did not know that we have to keep a device transfer code and password as a backup in a situation like this, so I had to do some research and I figured how to email the customer support team for this game, and I gained my account back in a few days in addition to the good customer support I was provided with, however I was then advised to backup such details by email as well, whilst I agree with this, I wonder if the developer's of this game could either link the master ID details to the Play Games app from Google, so that the users could login with this?, And if this can't be done, then I think the first tutorial for beginners should be how to backup the important details that helps them recover their account? cause I myself had to go through this issue due to being unaware of it, a big Thanks to the fgo customer support team and I really hope that this game will improve on its method of data linking/handling."
Is nice
best Fate game out there the gacha is a bit rough but after a while you'll the units you want... probably...
I'm not a big fan of games like this but this in particular has changed my mind! It's definitely fun! But lately there has been event after event and it's a bit hard to keep up with. But I seem to manage but sometimes I don't complete the events cuz i have been busy doing real life stuff dealing with real life problems that come my way. This game isn't for anyone who I really busy
"Very good turn gamed jrpg, all that would be needed was more exp card trades and faster restocks in mana prisms trades for tickets"
only one word can describe it... Best!
God level good
"All you need to know: This game involves Gachas Waifus Many, many tears That 5 star character you'll never get Amazing paid currency prices Addictive clickety leveling up of characters (exuberantly exhorting when you level them) BUT... Through it all, you will never regret You will save your quartz, roll, not get the character that you want *character rates are abysmal. And still, you love it so much. Because that's what it is. The never ending chase of the thrill. Adapted lore with ridiculous twists that leave you in awe at the end. Looking at the characters you've managed to get, & still, realising they're not so bad after all. For this is your fight And they are your warriors They will give their heart and soul (literally) to fight for you Isn't that enough? Fate Grand Order: The game that eats one's heart and soul. If you're ready, it's a trip to take you'll never look back on. Save, summon, GO! *Word of caution: Rate up is still a lie"
It is a awsome game to play.
It's a really fun time.
The best fate game ever
A very fun game.
E K S U K A R I B A A A A ! ! ! !
Bad Game but i liked it
"The gacha rates in Grand Order are terrible for these types of games, but at the same time you can beat the content with low value servants so it isn't pay to win. Combine that with decent gameplay and in my opinion the best story for a gacha game once it picks up and I'd at least recommend giving it a try if you are a Fate fan"
"The perfect game for every Fate fan, umu umu."
Played it a bit. It's alright.
The game is addictive and add the story it's all I can ask but there's one NA should be fast to close the event gap about 2 years in JP server
Wifu is lifu
S·∫Øp t·ªõi kh√¥ng ra Ozy t cho 1 sao :((( Edit: n sq no Ozy :'(
"If you like fate series, play this"
"I love this game and play it everyday. I was super excited to get two of the best servants in the game at the beginning too, especially since one is my favorite character in the anime. The only complaint I have is that a lot of stuff seems geared towards men, especially the summer event. Girls play too, you know, and some of us don't appreciate being called a gentleman. Just saying."
"Played it for the story and I was not disappointed, remember roll for bae üòç"
Best waifus!
"This is a fairly great game, but is occasionally bogged down by grinding and lack of story (though this second problem has vastly improved since the app first launched a year ago). Definitely recommend it, along with the rest of the various Type-Moon works."
"Okay, so it's really good, real fun, especially if you're a fan of the Fate series, but it's got this God awful bug where scenes with dialogue crash the game, making it near impossible to progress in the story."
"The game, story line and even the characters are all awesome. Good work."
GACHA IS HELL!!!!!
"Pretty good game provided you have stable net. Drop rates are murder, but you can always find things to do. Very frequent events. Good system."
My main waifu game.
First time with Gacha game. Love it!!!
This rpg game gets addictive with its storyline. Not to mention some funny one liners.
"It's a wonderful and addicting game, the pacing of the story and difficulty allows one to get into the more complex methods of the combat system while not feeling thrown in brusquely. The Gacha system is more fair then many say, as while and 4* and 5* are pretty rare, there are plenty of 3* that are much better then some of them in their class, hell the only better rounded support then. Hans is Waver, and even then Hans has uses Waver doesn't. Even outside of gameplay the game excels my expectations with the story, it manages to keep stakes high while also keeping things comedic when need be. There's also the factor of constant events being used to gain more resources and even more units, not to mention good units such as Rider Kintoki or Chloe Von Einzbern, one of the best Buster Crits and on of the best Arts Crits units in the game so far."
"As stated by previous reviews, gacha is highway robbery. This won't affect you too much cause the game can be played with the low star servants (Unless you're really after a 5 star waifu then you're probably better off buying physical merch). It has events that give you free servants if you participate actively. Beware though because the gacha is the beginning, the game is pure farming hell. P.S. PLAY ONLY IF YOU HAVE SPARE TIME."
Rawr
"Basic easy turn based action makes for a good game I can play while watching TV or whatever but they are so reluctant to give you premium currency it takes forever to build up enough to buy the deal with the guaranteed 4 star character that it's not even close to worth putting in the time, to the point where it almost feels like you have to dump money into it to get characters but then you realize that the drop rates are so incredibly low that you would have better luck emptying your bank account in the slots at a bar."
Gacha gacha more gacha
Watched the whole Fate series....And now this a game of it.....OMAYGAD just loved it so much.....great story too......nc graphics
Feels like your in the fate series and one awesome main character! Love the game soo much!
"Story is well writen and immersive. If you`re a fan of the Fate series, this is a must play."
"I love this game until i press the event summon, it took me 30 saint quartzs and not thing happened. I have a rush in taking combat saving those quartzs for a whole day and they had gone like nothing happened >< I reopen it, reconnect to internet and then neither summons recerived nor saint quartzs return.."
Always Transfer Error
RPG grind gacha hell with Waifus. No pvp so there isn't any pay2win factor outside of collecting your favorite hero via gambling. 10/10 Will go bankrupt from playing too much.
Viva la France!
Incompatible with Android Pie... #sad
The game itself is fantastic and has a wonderful story. What would make the game better is if the company was more generous towards it's fan base. Giving it little to nothing on special events and such. The Japanese version does that. Why can't NA? Smh
Fun challenging combat espeacially if u like fate series
Fun game as long as you don't spend a fortune on it
"This game is great. Lots of plot, and lots of plot."
Give me Ssr just it
No support for Android P. Only app that doesn't work. Support gave me a generic response and didn't address the questions asked. Update: six months later and the official Android P/9.0 release has rolled out. Still isn't supported. Still don't have issues with ANY other applications.
Great game. Lots of the characters from Fate that you've come to love whether or not you've seen the Anime/Mangas/Novels it will surely suck you in if your into turn based games
"For what it is, for free, it's a good time waster. Unfortunately much like 
all gacha games, it suffers with perpetual rare draw spam events utilizing 
fractional percent drop rates and high amounts of premium currency. What's 
worse is that there IS NO DATA BACKUP. The available recovery system is a 
joke to try and process, let alone find since I had to look through Reddit 
and different forums posts through Google to find the right channels. 
Unless you've burned every detail and stat of your game and characters to 
memory, you'll have no luck through support. Obviously, this game also does 
not support Google Play's cloud for data backup. If you spend any money on 
the game, you are also flat out told there can be no exceptions, you must 
either have updated information burned into your mind or a phone that isn't 
broken (in my case, my screen shattered and any attempts to blindly 
navigate into the phone via software was a failure). It's a very risky game 
you shouldn't devote a lot of time into, but is worth a try if you're 
looking for a flashy waste of your idle time. There's definitely better 
options out there, which I've moved onto, but it's sad that a series I've 
enjoyed thoroughly has such an awful mobile game market adaptation. Guess 
that's just what becomes of well known titles these days."
This game is a must have for all FSN fans and even those who like turn-based strategy games. The game is also full of well-made storylines (little-to-no spoilers to the main anime). The support team is also efficient and quick to respond to technical inquiries! I hope we get more games like this from playstore!
Alter Emiya is kinda disappointing...
Like the game but RNG for summoning is real low.
Not supported for Android 9
"Can't try it, just instantly crashes and tries to send an email to support. Razer phone 8.1 oreo"
Great Game PLS Make more great skins for events
"Great game. Pretty addictive, specially if you are a FATE but the devs 
really need to increase the rate up for 5-star servants."
"I like all the events and gameplay and it is kind of challenging so it is 
fun to me."
Fun game for salty pulls
"overall i love the gameplay, quality, story enjoyable game <3"
"Love the game an all. But now im no longer able to play it. As it says 
Fate/Grand Order is not playable under your playing environment. Please 
contact us via email then we will give you an information about the data 
migration to the sender's email address......i sent it in. Im hopin for a 
reply else i wont play"
It loads too much..
"The problem is, that it so hard to get a 4 star let alone a 5 star. 
Basically you have to pay to get a guaranteed good/useful character. If u 
don't have money i practically don't recommend unless you have a tremendous 
amount of luck. Besides that good game"
"Poor quality game just out to make money. Game play is boring and it's 2d 
animations. This games keeps track of if you spent real money and hinders 
you for it. Don't waste your time. Stuck to the anime."
1 star game does not launch for me.
Not a game for people who have no luck
"I finally got my account back, thanks to support team. it takes longer than 
I assume but nonetheless I still got it"
1* doesn't work anymore. Fail.
Nothing happens when I open the app. It will only redirect me to an e-mail app and send the crash report to the game developers.
"I love this game but because of the Android update to 1.9 I can't play it 
please hurry with the update"
"This game is the most textbooklike definition of Gacha Hell granted it is 
still one of the best Gacha games I have ever played."
"The early game can feel a bit slow but once you start really leveling up 
your servants and fighting stronger opponents, the game really begins to 
shine. Who you bring, what skills they have, and how you use them become 
essential for winning and makes for some incredibly satisfying moments. 
Amazing game."
Best mobile game out there
CAN'T PLAY IT
"You can pass on the basic till the very end of the game with your very 
first character pull (If you can hold on to it that long). You can also try 
to collect other good character, but the thing is that, its pure gambling 
with horrendous rates, like when you put your love and passion, with a 
chance of throwing $100 and you get either insult or just plain out abysmal 
self awareness in style of anime, trying to make fun of you who spend your 
hard earned cash (Don't know why the community feels fine to this insult) 
In short: If you can hold on to that starter character till the very end 
without getting tempted to spend cash, you have a pretty good experience on 
this game. Otherwise you just depriving yourself."
"Games great, but I updated to android 9 and can't play anymore. Will up the 
star once I'm able to play again."
"Please help!!! I really enjoy this game really but my app crashed and I 
couldn't get it open finial uninstalled and reinstalled and lost 
everything. This is the second time this has happened and the help desk has 
you fill out this huge list and after fighting with them the first time I 
have given up. If they can recover my account I'll download again."
"Fun game to pass the time with. Main advice we can give you currently is 
that the game is currently incompatible with Pie/Android 9 P. Was unaware 
of this and now cannot even access the game. Awaiting the team's tests to 
find what causes this, then we'll be back in the game. Being patient."
"This game is such I cant play with my redmi 4 prada That says eror code bla 
bla bla"
"Great for those looking into either starting the Fate series or for older 
fans looking for a fun way to pass time and collect your favorite servants."
"Great game for what I was able to play if it. My Pixel XL upgraded to 9.0 
and now I can no longer play. Support for the game responds quick to 
inquiries but still no resolution to me not being able to play. The game I 
am sure deserves a higher review, but I can only go based on the VERY SHORT 
time I got to play. Now I missed out on a lot of the new events..."
Drop rate over rarest units is too low
Its a great game that doesn't force you to get into the series to watch
I love it so much and is so fun
"Been playing for a while but ever since my Pixel 2 XL upgraded to Android P 
(9.0) I cannot get on due to the game not being supported. Please fix, I 
miss my waifus"
"Was fun until the pie update. Now it doesn't work at all and It's been 
weeks, they haven't fixed it. Maybe someday but doesn't seem like they are 
really trying."
"I'm a huge Fate fanatic, and let me start off by saying I loved this game, 
and I spent lots of hours grinding, and spent actual money on this game 
even though I usually refuse to do that. The newest update corrupted my 
game, and the game suggested I uninstall the app, and reinstall, and that 
my data would be fine. I did so, and lost literally all the hours and 
servants I had. I emailed every support email with ample information, and 
not a single one even responded to me. I am uninstalling this app and not 
spending another damn dollar on it before it makes me feel negative towards 
my favourite anime. Shame a decent game has awful support."
Wasting money on this game is a retarded thing to do just dont whale cuck
"Update: once again a new version of Android is released after several 
months of beta and this game doesn't support it. Get your act together and 
do something."
Just working well for Me.
"waifu/husbando game with story. i recommend you to also get yourself into 
to the fate franchise"
"Free game with the story and gameplay of comparable depth to a paid game. 
I've tried quite a few gacha games, and this is the only one that's ever 
felt fair - you're constantly getting free premium currency, and the 
special events (which are usually hilarious and happen with alarming 
frequency) usually give away a fairly strong Servant. If you're not 
familiar with the Fate universe, some things will go over your head, but 
there is just so much quality on display here."
"it keep telling me ‚ÄúFate/Grand Order is not playable under your playing 
environment. Please contact us via email then we will give you an 
information about the data migration to the sender's email address.‚Äù please 
help me fix this problem. I did not root or something, and it is Ok 
yesterday. How would this happen?"
"Didn't care for it. When they say the story is told in over a million words 
they aren't kidding. There's far more reading than gameplay. Graphics are 
good but very inconsistent. NPCs are either bland or irritating and 
certainly don't make me feel like helping them."
Crashes immediately when i launch. LG stylo 3 plus.
It's OK
"I love this game, but after latest phone updated, I haven't been able to 
play. Please fix ASAP"
"Hasn't even been a week and it says the application hasn't launched 
properly. It's done this so many times to me and is pissing me off."
Very polished.
"FGO is a great game i liked it. It has a great graphics. But fix your drop 
rates please."
A phone game that isn't an ad infested cash grab. Fun and engaging
Cant play it cause phones rooted thx
"Great game, but it appears it is not compatible with the most recent 
update. Hopefully this gets resolved soon ."
It's amazing!
The cruelest Gacha system around. Whale at your own risk.
I love fate so much!
I love your work you should make it like bleach brave souls
"Great game, good story, simple to understand battle system but can be 
complex. The gacha system is the only bad thing"
"Opening the app takes me to my mail and sends an error email to the game's 
support."
Best game ever.
"For me the drop rates aren't bad. I haven't paid a dime and I drew 4 5* 
servants."
"Ok would love to give a better review but the game would not open upon down 
load so I can only give it one star"
"I like play the game it a fun play to play. It is a good play and a 
beautiful game to. I like the character is the game and I like the opening 
to the game. And I like the game story to it."
Give 5 star servant to get 5 star rating
Put first person
"Game takes too long to load and this problem is always a constant. I don't 
even bother playing anymore cuz I'll be sitting there for 10 mins and the 
game is still only at 25%. Until this problem is fixed 3 stars is the best 
it's getting from me."
Great Game but luck needed
"Actually do enjoy the game but have become unable to play. Seems to be a 
problem with Android 9. Game doesn't function on Pixel XL, 2 XL, or 
Essential after upgrading to Pie. Dev response is the OS is not supported. 
Sad to see this and hope it is resolved soon."
Wouldn't let me past the loading screen
"Hey can you give me atleast 4 star servant because i literally summon in 10 
summon and i literally got no four star servant that just not fair and pls 
read and understand"
"This game has a great story, decent gameplay, and best of all, its single 
player so pay2win is not an issue. That said, the drop rate for rare 
servants is horrendous at just 1%, although you can clear the game with 
lower rarity servants. There is a reason this game ranks among the top 
grossing games and that is due to the expensive gambling system that is 
implemented. If obtaining the rare servants were made easier or more 
affordable, this game would be a 5‚òÜ and instant classic. 4‚òÜ from me."
"Why it always asked me do clear cache on start up, I accidentally click yes 
once and I need to redownload the game data again, mobile data is also 
expensive you know, pls fix"
"Game would not open. Instead, it forced my Gmail inbox to open repeatedly, 
displaying an error text without fail."
"It's a really good game with a fun card-based combat system and lots of 
story. It's free to play but doesn't have any nuisances pestering you to 
pay-- the game is completely playable with the characters you get for free, 
and pulling on the gacha is just bonus. I kinda fell off from playing, but 
only because it was getting to be a bit of a slog. It takes a fair bit of 
grinding to fully level up and skill up your Servants, and also there is a 
lot of story to read through. The writing is generally alright, but after a 
long day of work sometimes I just don't want to read 20,000 words about 
Francis Drake (waifu version). That's not a fault with the game, but with 
myself. That said, however, I would watch an anime about Jeanne Alter."
Too much download
"On my top ten best rpg games that I have played, you must download."
"I download the game and it wont open for me so and when it does errors 
every single time."
"I use to play this game daily and have multiple max level 5* servants but 
after a while the game gets extremely dull, having you do the same thing 
over and over again. Combat is too repetitive, load times are long and 
annoying, events are okay but tiresome when it follows the same format over 
and over, 4 and 5* servant rates abysmal and are stuck behind a sea of 
useless craft essence (seriously I have only gotten 1 4* servant this 
year), prices for quartz is way too expensive (never bought any), the only 
thing that keeps people playing is the fact it's a Fate game."
Gacha scam money drain. 0 strategy
Deleted will not load junk!
Doesn't work on android
"I would rate much higher but for some loading problems. It'll tell me the 
app didn't launch properly and to recheck my connection at certain times 
when using my mobile data. The problem is I was just on the app a few 
minutes ago with my mobile data. At this point, it'll continuously ask me 
to check my mobile connection and retry or restart, and unless I connect to 
a faster network it won't fix, and even if it does it'll only work for a 
while before repeating this process. I would rate higher if this problem 
was fixed."
Best fate game ever!
"A little finicky, but very pretty to look at."
Game won't launch on Android 9 Pie
"Good game overall. But if you are not a lucky enough, it really will make 
you feel like giving up as 5* drop rates are really low. Gave up after 
failing to get any 5* servants or even some 4* that I like after almost 
half a year."
Most fun and addicting gacha. Story isn't bad either.

"Is this game optimize in Huawei Y8 2018 because i always experience lag and 
sudden phone restart/crash everytime i get notifications. My phone is 2gb 
ram and 10gb sd 1.5gb internal. Pls fix. 5/5 if this game plays smooth in 
every phone."
"This game is like watching the anime so beautiful and get story if I could 
I love t make videos of it for my channel."
It's an ok game but got boring and collecting saint quartz takes way to long
"Very good arts for character design. Gameplay is simple. Story is amazing. 
Recommended RPG esp if u fans for Fate series."
"This game keep kicking me off of everything i like the game if i could play 
it"
Stinky give Free SQ üò™üò™
"I love the game, Ive been playing it for over a year. But watch out, it is 
gambling and the odds are outrageously bad. Like, on a rate up it's 0.700% 
chance to get the SSR you want. It has a fantastic story as well and the 
events, for the most part, are fun and engaging."
"I love this game but with the current 9.0 update I am unable to finish the 
current event so hopefully within the next day we will see a fix for the 
newest patch for Android."
Me love
"A huge fate fan. I'm glad this game got me back into the series, but wish 
gacha rolls weren't tempting fate... pun intended. xD"
Doesn't function on Android P. Update at own risk
I loved this game.... until it stopped being playable for whatever reason.
"Very fun, the story is very well written and emotional in some parts."
"The game was great when I could play it. It doesn't play under the new 
Android Pie Update, however. Until they update to Android 9 it'll rate a 1 
star."
"I can't even play it. Every time it's almost done, it cuts off and it makes 
my Internet looks low, i used to be able to play it, now I can't, this game 
need to be fixed."
"Customer service was very supportive in recovering my account. Best fantasy 
rpg I have ever played so far!!!"

"The gacha life can suck. But its a fun time and the gameplay can be 
rewarding."
"Love the anime, this games has great graphics, but it quickly gets boring ; 
like others say, gacha rates are low; and game pace is slow, can't skip 
battles."
"Great game, great story, great characters, but if you dont have self 
control you will probably go broke playing this game."
10/10!!
To many ads on hulu
"Will only connect on 4g but then tries to download a bunch of data to load 
the game. I am not going to burn up my data limit for this."
"Another expensive f2p game. Keep away from kids and adults with addiction 
problem. For unit that you love to have, it near impossible without 
gambling on the worst % rate in any gatcha game. You can play for the story 
but characters is a no go unless you at least spend 100$ on average to get 
lucky with them."
"While the gameplay was decent, the app doesn't work at all with 2G Internet 
speeds. The picture quality is excellent but pairs horribly with 2D side 
scrolling like gameplay. It would be nice if I could at least access the 
game menu with 2G Internet speed"
"Excelent gatcha game. It has a story that surpasses most other gams of its 
kind, and is one of the few apps I can say that I play for the story, and 
not just the franchise it is a part of. The lore is also wonderful"
"This game has good graphics for a rpg,the fighting style is nice and if you 
like mythological creatures or heroes then this is your game."
Game didn't start after install. Samsung galaxy s7.
"I love this game, but because of lack of support for the new Android P 
(released today) I am unable to play and all I got from support was ""we 
confirm that your device is using an unsupported OS"""
Im speech less
Need more waifus.
"The game is great but I'm giving it a 1 star cause they don't support the 
new android pie os I've been on the beta program and haven't been able to 
play for months now android pie is released and still can't play"
"So had this game for two days. Needed an update. Updated. App cannot be 
found. Clear cache. Cleared. Needs to download the game again. Spend four 
hours watching it get to 51% then go back to ""clear cache"" Great game.."
"Love the game, it has these amazing moments too"
"You can download it but you can't because of where you are? How's that even 
possible if you can download it on the 1st place"
"Love it, but the performance on lower end phones are bad. Would be nice to 
have a setting that would enable lower graphics and less animations"
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA 23AP DROP RATE???? HELL NO FIX YOUR ASCENSION DROP RATES IM 
ACRUALLY SO IRRITATED BY THIS I ALREADY SPENT 120AP FOR THE PAST 20 MINS 
AND NOT EVEN ONE PROOF OF HERO WTHH???"
GOOD GAME!
LEMME PULL SUMMER ARTORIA
"Fantastic game, however if you guys could add some type of border on it for 
players playing on tall phones such as myself, with the Samsung galaxy s8 
plus, that would be great. I am quite worried when playing the game because 
of screen burn issues"
Very fun. Would keep playing it as often as possible.
Loved. Fate stay fan btw.
Thanks again
"Amazing game but it takes way too much space. Every update is a struggle to 
find the room to keep this game, and the transfer number doesn't work."
Game is great.
Awesome game. Just wished the servant drop rate were a little better
As a fate fan been waiting for this to arrive on playstore.
this is one of the best games I've ever played it's so addicting
"One of two mobile games I've liked enough to stick with. Very f2p friendly 
with a great story that is only going to get more intense if JP is anything 
to go by."
"This game has everything you would want but the gatcha % is just stupid and 
predatory just go play something else and save your self the money and 
sanity"
"I love the game but can you make anniversary gatcha that doesn't use real 
money make it less servant to get for example and add in NA the new 
animation update I can stop playing the game I'm addicted"
Fun game.
"As a Fate fan, this game is quite enjoyable. The characters are great, the 
voice, the art, the battles, the animation, It's all topnotch. I passed my 
history exam because I played thisüòÇ So, this game is highly recommended. 
Although, you have to very patient or either lucky to summon the Servant 
you want. Cause of the .7% Rate summon of Servantsüòë... But, you can finish 
the game using 3-1 stars Servants only, unlike other sh*ts."
Rates are bad but I get what I want cuz I'm gangster
I just love playing the game
Best gacha game out there
Y'can get pretty good waifus here
"I loved everything about it, Even the Battle system! But please make the 
rates not too low, even some items have really small drop rate. But still, 
This game is great!!!"
"Froze on a singularity. Cant play üò© uninstalled and reinstalled and now My 
account gone. Wasted too much on this game.... I'm pissed Update. Got my 
acct back. Game is awesome"
"all gacha games are bad, but this is the least bad one"
Yorokobe Shounen! Kimi no Negai wa Yoyakku Kanau!
Came for the waifus stayed for the story and the waifus.
"If you're into collecting characters and great storylines then be ready to 
lose all sense of time as you get sucked into this game."
"Great Game play, Animations and Tough Strategy demands."
Funnnn
Badass game. Love the story and everything about the game.
wish there were special cg's
This is a grand quest to get all your fate waifus
Just go play jp version
"Personally I do like the game. But the issue with the game is its all solo 
content and has not much aim in this game as compare to other game (e.g 
arena and all) it makes it feel to me that I created something super strong 
yet for no reason"
GOOD GAME FOREVER
I wish I could play this on pc
"Pixel 2 unsupported, Android P unsupported, customer service can't decide 
wether its the OS or the device that's not supported. Using specific code 
to prevent the loading of an app based on OS version used is stupid, 
idiotic, and highly inconsiderate. Every other game runs fine, but this one 
won't even try to load. How stupid. 0 out of 5."
I love this game but i hate the gacha and price for saint quartz.
"Reviews about how hard it is to get 5 star seems to not be true for me 
because I got one 5 star essence and two 5 star servants on my first 20 
summos. I don't know, I'm just lucky I guess. Anyways great game the only 
problem for me are the loading times, if there would be anyway to fix this 
problem it would be pretty much appreciated."
"Great game! So many talented people behind it! Amazing story, Illustrators 
and Voice Actors! Addictive! Gacha rate is terrible, but still fun to play 
LMAO 1% SSR. Tho i managed to pull some SSR Servants.The dev sometimes 
makes an event where you can pull guaranteed SSR on gacha, so it's fair 
enough."
"Awesome game, good graphics, good story, and awesome character"
I have a high end flagship device and the game wont run
No support for Sony z3
Worst rates in any gacha game I've played so far
i got problem to procceed buy saint quartz. please help
Game wont load and white screen only then closes
Can you fix the lag also best fate game
Saber OP
"Doesn't work, won't open - error, game is unplayable under your playing 
envrionment"
"Recently there have been frequent crashes, please fix"
I T CAN'T OPEN (The game btw )
"A game for fans of the Fate series as well as deck builder strategy games. 
Short time investments reward with rich stories and evolving challenges. 
Viable for free to play gamers."
"Alot going on but no real direction in anything really. Just a generic easy 
to get lost game"
Awesome and additive
"Great game with wonderful stories and stunning characters! Interesting to 
see how characters interact differently outside the conventional Fate 
series(anime and manga)! Keep it up!"
"Great game, tutorial level can be bothersome but the plot will start start 
moving along with the tutorial"
"I heard a lot of great things about the game, frankly, I'm rather 
disappointed. The gacha thing, is gambling, or just about. Can't wait for 
lootvoxes laws to come to Canada."
"The saint quarts crystals for summon hero's and level up are ways too 
expensive to purchase! Drop rates for 5* hero's and level up cards are damn 
(F*C*ING) rare and hard to get! Always getting only 3* cards most of the 
times! If u are very lucky once in awhile u might get a 4* cards! When u 
finish a chapter u will get a saint quarts crystals. As u go by the game it 
is harder for u to clear a stage as u need stronger hero's and leaving up 
also need stronger cards! U will get friends points most of the time but u 
only get below 3* cards! I will give this game a 4* to 5* rating if the 
drops rates for cards are better for 4* to 5* cards for hero's and level up 
materials! Hopefully this game can be improve as times goes by..."
Siooo slowb
10/10 too many wifus
gacha gacha stamina
Nothing more than a boring grind fest.
"I've been playing the game ever since then and i actually love it even the 
anime made me love it. But when i change phone, the game did not play. Can 
you fix it? I'm using LG V10, thank you for your reply.."
"A fun game and f2p players can play it. You can get through the story with 
1-3 star units but you need to plan how you will defeat some bosses in the 
game,no need to invest money into the game and sometimes it might give you 
a 4-5 servant when you least expect it. Currently I have six 4 stars and 
one 5 stars even though I'm f2p player."
Nice!
"For those planning on playing this in the long run, better make a transfer code and have it written down.  The game has no support for recovering accounts and I've lost mine after my phone conked out.   Spending money is truly a gamble given the game has no way of binding the account to either Google Play or Facebook.   Game-wise its a generic hero collecting game common with other games including Gacha mechanics and grinding. The only good thing on this game is the story divided according to levels with an occasional event story."
I think it was really great and cool.
Do not get it I was sharing fore 1 hoawer
"I used to enjoy this game until I got my new phone, they don't have support 
for some of the new devices out there. Once they do I'll gladly change my 
rating, but as it stands I'm no longer able to enjoy this game due to 
compatibility issues. (I own a Razer phone) Update: turns out the game will 
crash if you have developer options enabled, turn that off and the game 
starts up normally. Great game, not a fan of having to turn off a phone 
feature to play it though."
fun new fate and type Moon universe story.
Fun at first but gets really boring after some time
"Great game for Fate series fans. The rolling mechanic percentages leaves a 
lot to be desired, but if you can get past that and be content it's awesome."
Doesn't even start. Pixel 2 XL.
"Great game especially if you're a big fates fan, only down side about this 
game is that the server we use for the western part of the world isnt as 
organized pr generous as the jp server."
"The game is amazing for type moon's first mobile game, although I wish it 
would have been one of their other franchises at first since the fate 
series is all over the place"
"The game is a great time-killer and a worthy addition to the Fate series. 
Between the events that offer a nice break from the main story, they are a 
nice addition to give different scenarios as well as more insight into the 
characters we all know and love."
"I already download game from here. so why do I have to download another 
from inside the game. man what a waste of time. I uninstall from the moment 
I saw I have to download more."
"Had to reset the game because it wasn't connecting to the server. I'm not 
going through the long and boring tutorial a second time."
"Its a pretty good game, tho gacha hell is real"
"Love the game and the character designs and hope it continues for a long 
time"
Doesn't even launch
"Yo this game was great and all until it started crashing. A lot. I can't 
even open it anymore, even after 2 reinstalls. Rip my progress lol"
Looks great. Just wish I could play it. (Phone is probably incompatible).
It looks great too play
I want seiba
The best salt mine on the store
"Extremely disappointed as a fan of Fate/Stay Night. The gacha rates are 
incrediblybad, and the game is not even a little generous with rolls with 
almost no free ones and a high cost for them. The gameplay is dull, 
repetitive and the game forces you into combat often. Above all, the story 
up until the third arc is abysmal, and the VN presentation of the story 
sequences have absolutely no polish. The only thing I can praise is the 
varied character illustrations."
It the best game ever
A really good game for those who are Fate franchise fans! Love this game!
Make it available on EU
"Its not bad,i don't dislike it,i do enjoy it for its ability to kill time 
or even so much as let me get some awesome heroic spirits"
"This game is based on history, mythology, & fictional stories"
Thanks you so much
I installed the game...i cant open it. Samsung S9+
"I love the game, but I hate how you lose all progress if your phone gets 
stolen or breaks. I wish there was a way to link the game to Google 
play.... I had a lot of good stuff and lost it all"
"Good gameplay and story, i guess. But I came for saber"
"Not into games that need terms of service and need to make a account and 
need internet to play all set"
I think this is my picture taken by my ex boyfriend
"Not playable on Galaxy S7 edge. Game crashes instantly on startup saying 
playing environment is not compatible."
"Can you PLEASE make using a support character optional? I want to save the 
world with MY characters, not other player's OP characters."
"Very fun for a phone game, and has a good amount of content. Only real 
issue is how expensive Saint Quartz are, which makes me never want to buy 
any."
A really good game no complaints
It was stupid
Inconsistent art terrible draw rates and the gameplay is boring
crashes on start
Good game keep it up
"The game is great and Addicting. I was wondering if u could add Auto Mode 
or Auto Play where the characters fight bu themself?"
It won't open for me. It keeps triggering my email for whatever reason
"As a fan of the Fate series I really love the story of this game but the 
let down is how hard it is to collect 5 star servants especially those that 
are event limited"
"Do I really have to say anything? It's a Fate game! Of course, it's good!"
Takes too long to load
App generates an email saying that the game is unplayable
"I watched this anime on Netflix and it was pretty good but a little gory 
too I think it's ok..... btw why is saber the icon of the game"
"It's a good game but the lag and download in issues are a deal breaker for 
me."
Cant even download it
I wish I was around for the overlord update but it is still a good game
"The game's turn-based is fun and gaining Servants as well. However, the 
Gacha system's percentage for very rare Servants like 5 stars is only just 
a percent, making it only for pay2win gamers, which also gives a small 
chance for Free2play gamers"
"I Love This Game Even Though It Takes My Wi-Fi Away I Still Love It. Its 
Really Fun To Play!"
"I find it very entertaining but could you add in some more functions to 
customize the player avatar?"
Loving the game.
"I would have loved to keep this game on my phone but the whole ""forced to 
take a support character"" irritates me I should be able to take three of my 
own units through without being forced to add someone else's four stars 
until that is fixed"
One of the top gacha games eVER.
"Yeah Im giving this only a 1 star cause everytime its 100% it take my back 
to the home page please fix it cause I wanna play it."
"Done for download but i cant play....it doesnt work...pls guidre me for 
what should i do...i want to play this game"
Its not working for me
Waifu collector.
App won't run on my LG V30.  Just crashes and keeps wanting to send out emails to Aniplex.
"I would give it 5 but anytime I try to open the app it tries to open my 
email up"
Didn't work on Android 9 beta 5 . Crashed on launch
"It's a good game for people who like the fate/ series It also has good 
dialog and good graphics"
Please just let me have my waifus
"I love the game, love the plot... Strenghtening a servant is pretty normal 
which is good and really easy to understand but do you mind fizing the 
normal speed when battling? Cause when i switch it to normal its like in 
slowmo and its kinda throwing me off... I know that the solution is just 
simply clicking the forward like thingy but of course there a times when we 
want to see the attack patterns and NP of the new servants ... You make 
really great character so sometimes we also wanna see the beauty of your 
creations.."
"It's a great game but it keeps crashing and it's slow the draw rates are 
trash it's a fun game but it's like pushing me to pay real money to get the 
servents I want and it takes forever to save up the premium currency but 
overall great game"
"Fate/Grand Order is the perfect game for you if your a fan of the Fate/ 
series. Controlls are easy to use. Story is well done and you can eaven 
change the diologue depending on which options you choose during the 
diolouge moments. New servants are added to your rng summoning pool each 
time you clear a chapter. The events are very well done. The company is 
very generous and gives out the currency fir summoning servants quite often 
so thats never a problem."
"Really fun at all times except when you draw nearly all three star 
Alexanders."
I've seen so much p**n of these characters
In love with the storyline and all of the characters before I even pull them
Best game I love it and love the anime
"installed on my phone and it immediately spammed opening gmail to write 
crash reports once every 5 seconds until I had close to 20 tabs open of the 
crash report and this would not cease until I uninstalled it. this cant be 
a hardware issue as I have the newest Samsung phone so I have no clue why 
this happened."
"Its really good, especially if you're a fate fan and even if you're not, 
there's a good chance you will be. The gacha rates are really painful 
though. And lately my app has not been launching properly it would say."
"I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME yhe gameplay is legit plus it has like every fate 
characters"
Great game. It also has an anime called carnival phantasm
"Good writing, written by Nasu themself. If you enjoyed the original visual 
novel you'll enjoy this."
Waifu is lifu
"The worst gacha system known to man. I still can't stop trying to pull my 
SSR waifus."
"there a lot of ppl complain about slow release, but i like how aniplex keep 
their pace. not rushing like other server and try to match in game event 
with irl event. well there aren't much hype as jp for new stuff. but its 
okay i prefer this rather thatln getting Christmas event on summer."
"Literally will not let me play the game. I start the game and it makes me 
send an email to the developers."
I loveeee the game. So much. Super fun. No complaints. Please play üòÅ
"Good time killer and I love battling with and against my favorite heroic 
spirits (I'm still looking for Artoria/Altaria Pendragon though)"
I hated this game but the people that made it were great
"I can't even go in the game it says could not connect but it was working 
just fine plz fix because this is a great game"
Woooooo
"The gatcha, the dam gatcha..."
the salt it's real!! xD
Umu :3
"I love the game as well as the whole fate universe, it's a little 
disappointing that most of the good servants require a lot of saint quarts 
and the only way to really get that many is to buy them. I had saved up for 
months to get berserker cu,"
Oreos
Great game fun to play
"Great RPG. Love the storylines, the style of fighting and the cute 
graphics. Best RPG out there."
"It's a very fun game and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good 
storyline. The gameplay is amazing and the characters are even better."
"I am familiar with its gameplay since i play it on iOS and i made much 
further progress so i am trying the android version to see what i can do in 
this version and i tried something in the friends list and turns out i can 
use my main in the iOS version to help me get further in the game in this 
version its really an awesome game"
"This game is really good . But I'd appreciate it if their was an auto 
button , it takes forever trying to choose your turn and also completing 
seven missions just to get one Quartz? It's really time consuming. But if 
they could fix this , it will be an amazing app that I'd definitely put 
more time into !"
I like
"Reach the swirl of the root on your phone. Automatically negating such 
magic since it's employing science"
1% is hell.
"This is a great game.but the gacha is the reason I made the rating 3‚òÖ.the 
5‚òÖ star servant rate to summon is less than 1%.I hope that they will make 
it more higher"
"I started to love it and enjoy it but a maitence happened and deleted my 
content. So I am deleting the app."
Great time spender
Great game overall but mostly just a massive money sink.
If you a fan of the anime your going to love this.
I uninstalled and the info kept popping up
"Probably the best like ""Mobile Game"" there is? Awesome characters... Good 
story.. Easy and fun controls... Anime based so yeah"
"Great game and better anime but in app purchase is extremely necessary if 
you want anything good"
"1% drop rates, disparity in server rewards and last time I checked, King 
Arthur was a dude yeah??"
The stupid game didn't work
"Terrible gacha but great story and characterization. Top notch production 
value as well. Too bad it's too far behind the JP version."
Can you give us more quartz? Like at least 5 for the facebook like campaign?
As a fate fan. This is what I needed
A gacha made for kings
"Some of events like the recent summer event has 0 appreciation for 
female/gay audiences"
I give you 5 stars you give me 5 stars üòâ
awesome gameüòÄ
All the salt in the world is not enough
Great game jist be carefull how much you spend on it
10/10 would mine salt for Jalter again
"Good game! Though I think sometimes you should add special discounts to 
make up for the 1% servant since we're not all whales and rich."
"Great story, nice game play, and great side stories."
one of the best vn and game
This game is not working for me -galaxy s9
"I had an account with 1 ssr (alot for me) and i lost it. I thought i made a 
transfer code but when i entered it, it did not link it and its lost for 
good now:( wish you could fix this...."
"Love the game, just needs more males! Specifically the good-looking ones! 
Ikemen, bishounen, and shotas!!! Fanservice of female servants is fine, but 
please let the guys join in the fun too!"
"What an amazing story, suspending the players to summon characters and 
enlightened the anime you know off in Fate."
i love you i miss you
Best gameplay and waifus
Couldn't even play the damn game. What a scam
It is cool
Game of my life.
"Doesn't work on the latest version of Android on the Razer Phone... Won't 
even start up."
Love the game!!!
"I love this game but recently it wont load. All it does is direct me to my 
gmail to send an error report. Anyone else having this issue? It was after 
my phone updated. Samsung s7"
"AMAZING. I am in love with this game. The story line is great. The graphics 
are great. The character development is great. They give you free 4* people 
sometimes during events which keeps it interesting. Plus all of the 
characters have awesome backgrounds that keep you trying to level up their 
bonds. I have nothing bad to say about this game. I would highly suggest 
downloading it. You will not be disappointed. The only thing I have a 
concern on is how hard it is to get 4* and 5* characters (even though some 
of the 3* are just as good). But keep doing what you are doing.üòÄüíù"
"Good game with a deep collection of characters. But becomes a pay2play 
after chapter 4 if you don't have powerful characters."
"I love the game, but the recent update made multiple bugs appear. Text is 
whited out, and cutscenes are all pink."
"As far as ""gacha"" games go, this is one of the best. Absolutely able to 
play as free to play, and while there are some very strong high-end 
servants, you can do very well with the more common ones too. It has very 
simple mechanics, but has not ever felt boring. I am not very familiar with 
the lore of the universe, but even knowing very little, I'm enjoying it."
Graphics are superb. Storyline is smart. The characters are fun.
"My account is gone and would like for help to recover it but don't kNow 
where to ask."
"New to Fate, I think it's a fun game."
"More Improvement also. The game burns some money for working guys and those 
none workers are crying hard for the saint quarts."
I can't even open the app
"It wont even start,crashes on start with error 60."
"Would love to play, but keyboard wouldn't open at name entry"
"the games good but i'm a little bit curios i'm trying to harvest proof of 
hero and i have already done the marseille - orleans 30 times and never got 
a single one proof of hero can you please help?! and can you try to rework 
cu chullain caster can make it like the movie where he can use melee 
attacks thank you!"
"I get why some people hate the gacha system since it means that they are 
less likely to get the characters they want, however in my opinion the game 
is quite balanced. Rarer characters require alot more materials before they 
get all their skills. Besides the game can still be beat with the common 
serveants, some of the best serveants are common or free serveants. Some 
people are also upset that the english server is behind the japanese server 
but I am fine with that as it allows for me to plan ahead of time and gives 
me time to do other things. Though I do wish that some qualitty of life, 
graphics and animations are updated int the english server earlier."
It could be more fun if rookies were able to summon much rarer servants!
Great story and waifus
"Well i was gonna avoid it due to the 1% rate horror stories i hear when 
getting the SSR of your dreams but so far it's a grear game. The art style 
is fine but i enjoyed the story, coming from someone who doesn't care for 
fate series but yeah."
"Even F2P the game offers a lot of fun and especially so for fate fans. Just 
watching your servants dish it out and finding awesome team synergies is 
rewarding as hell."
"This is a great game I just wish I could have more free time to play the 
game"
Fun. Geared toward not spending money.
"The thrill in this game is their Gacha system and a turn based action game 
using your favorite servants on the team."
"Drop rate of summon is so bad. Wasted too much time farming for saint 
quartz for summon gacha and got nothing. Definitely a pay to win game"
Why can't i install the game? I'm using Xiaomi Mi6.
"It's nothing special. The art is okay, although ridiculously heavy handed 
on the fan service. The gameplay w Is an interesting concept but shallow 
and boring in practice. The game is very grindy and the 'plot' is about as 
ridiculous as you'd expect from any cookie cutter anime about girls with 
near unlimited power that still oddly dress in lingerie. If that's your 
thing, this game is right up your alley."
"I really hate when I use a 30 saint quartz summon to get 8 craft essence 
and only 2 servants like every single time I use saint quartz to summon"
This game is very relaxing
best game in the world
Terrible gacha game
Gelud kok baris??
"Like the game and support team. After the renewals to the quartz system the 
game started to be fairer to it's paying players. But most of all the 
combat is fun and the game actually gives life to the protagonist and it's 
party members with their own stories."
"Really good and lots of fun. Cool characters and amazing visuals. A bunch 
of cute waifus and legendary heroes to satisfy your desires."
Love the story and characters
"One of my all time favorite games do recommend all Player Register account 
In case of need account transfer to new device Because dorne over is a 
bummer :) But over all beautiful game Follows the movie Step-by-step and 
The goes beyond a must have for fate/Stay Night fans Who want to know the

Forever fan Welcome to our world Will be re install at another time‚ù§ also 
if you are now its a good time to install i hear they have a special 
edition Going on right now Camelot!"
"Can't even play the game because of my ""playing environment"" what does that 
even mean... cant start up or do anything"
Literally tried downloading 6 times and the app kept crashing
"Gameplay mainly focuses on card combos, weaknesses and target selection. 
Voices are in japanese. Art is so-so. RNG character summoning has terrible 
rates and weak characters are given to you throughout the story. This game 
is super grindy, but you can use a friend's lvl 100 for everything even 
events. Earned in game currency can not be used on some summons. Very pay 
to win."
Give me a 5 üåü
"I cannot even launch the game after downloading it. It keeps prompting me 
to check my mobile signal, retry or restart the application. I am on Wi-Fi 
connection and beside my modem. No point in playing it."
"Would love to try this game if it would only load I download 100% of files 
in beginning and then force close"
"I really enjoyed the game however, it crashed a lot on my phone. So I 
transferred my data to my tablet now it won't load past the title screen."
"Fun and addicting, even for people with limited experience with the series"
Fix your garbage ass rates or delete yourself
"If you love the Fate series in all forms, you'll love this. Great game."
It amazing
"Everything but the fact saint quartz arn't purchaceable on android (so says 
the game) is great."
Bye
Would be better with auto battle
"Cannot login. I have been missing out on rewards because since the patch 
for anniversary, all i have had is problems. Most days cant even login."
"I loved the game! good graphics and controls! continue the anime and manga 
series and you'll see more of me playing your games"
Rubish draw rates
"I rated this a 4 star cause it has a good story, good graphics, and its a 
hard game that challenges these players. And why did i not rate it a five 
star?. Cause you need to spend money in this game to become strong and its 
so expensive and S.Q is hard to get/earn for, while us players grinding 
everyday to become strong neither during or without an event we try to earn 
our S.Q to buy that 30 S.Q thingy and try to get the card that we want 
while some of us players get lucky while some players dont and thats where 
the balance of this game cuts off and this is the part where i explain why 
this game is almost paid to play related whenever an event starts or even 
without an event...(btw im not saying that i hate this game cause of what 
im saying) the unfairness of some players that dont spend money on this 
game and the players that spend money on this game is where the balance 
cuts off for example one time i saw this paid S.Q event and there i was 
like okay ima grind but when i read it again i was like how can i get a 
five star card if its so rare (especially this game involves gambling or 
A.K.A test ur luck cause youre giving away youre S.Q and try to get cards) 
and this was the one time i thought i was gonna get a five star BUT u need 
to pay to get a guranteed 5 star in this event and i dont have the money to 
buy S.Q and my favorite Card was there too and thats where the balance of 
this game ticks off. But its a good game but it also needs to make the game 
fair to the no spend users with or without a event thank you and have a 
good day"
it is nice but this wont work on my device oppo a83
"This game deserves a one star due to the awful business practice of 
separating paid crystals from free crystals, then having summons where you 
have a guaranteed chance to get something good, but only if you drop like 
$30 on it. I'll spend money when I really enjoy a game, but it puts me off 
completely when there are summons like this that only favor the whales, 
when the whales already naturally have a huge advantage. It's sad, because 
it's a good game, but they really show you how little you're worth to them 
if you only want to drop $10-$15 here or there. You can drop the large 
amounts or deal with nothing."
"Played this on a friends phone played well tried on my tablet the screen on 
startup flashes black several times then the game closes every time"
"I enjoy the fate series and this game is very enjoyable. The fighting is a 
nice set up and the story is great to experience."
It cool keep on doing the great work on the game
"Hallelujah! Thanks for finally making this available in my country. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ In 
addition please add on a market/shop that sells/ships goods worldwide. T__T"
"Lots of people complaining about not getting their accounts back. Just want 
to say that everytime I have had any issue with my account the staff have 
helped me within the 3-4 business days. And everytime they where able to 
get my account back to me. So I dont understand all the complaints about 
the support team. Just saying they've been great to me everytime I have had 
to interact with them. (Make sure to make a transfer device code and keep 
the info!) Also some people are complaining about not getting what other 
servers had get compared to ours. Why are you complaining just play on the 
other servers then ... now onto my actual review. I love the game, but I do 
not think this is a easy game for people who are not able to put a lot of 
time investment into it. You can beat most content with any characters you 
choose but getting that character there is a long long long long long 
grind. Now the gacha rates are terrible less than one percent for your 5 
star summons. Now personally I like this. Don't hate me for my point of 
view but i LIKE the rareness of the heroes of this game. It actually feels 
special to pull that hero you want and even more devastating when you dont 
(MHX T.T)... But on the other hand I was surprised at how good mash has 
become, was suprised that my 4 star servants from events are actually good 
too. The latest update on the story blew me away... I loved it. Most of the 
events are fun, and I love the characters... if your a fan of type-moon its 
a must play. If your brand new to type moon i hope you enjoy the game like 
I have. thanks everybody involved in giving this game to us. PS. I Want the 
arcade game too PLS!"
"Absolutely love this game, even if this game doesnt love me back by giving 
me the servants i want...i still love it...but seriously, give me the 
servants i want please..."
"Honestly if you are all about gacha and 0 patience to play slowly/save up 
quartz to summon then look elsewhere cause this game is not for you."
Great game and story except gem are expensive through
"Love the anime, love the game, love the music!"
Please make this editor's choice please üòé üòã
Still no jalter :(
I am hooked on this game
Fun rpg that you can get a ton of fun with
It got very boring very fast
Loved the anime love the game
Wouldn't allow me to play
Can you guys just let me play at HTC one?
Great game. Just don't let the gatcha and the whiny community get to you.
"I really liked this game but stopped supporting the series after losing my 
account."
"This game is awesome! Very fun and addicting. The only issue I have is lack 
of SD card support, I added this game to my SD card and it was working 
perfectly until an hour ago when it would not run and I would get a message 
saying that the app is no longer compatible. Which was strange because when 
I moved it back to my internal storage it work fine. Can you please fix 
this bug I have? I have the LG Stylo 4 running Android 8.1"
"The game probably would be great/enjoyable, but anytime the screen times 
out upon unlocking my phone I am unable to return to the game, the phone 
goes/returns dark and I have to attempt to unlock it again. The behavior of 
the game when the screen times out is horrible and needs much improvement, 
once that happens it may be worth playing."
"I like this game but I'm deeply disappointed with the summoning, its all 
lie, it doesn't matter how many saints quarts you have or how high the 
chances of receiving a good servant are, I had over 100 saints quarts and 
all I received were a few 3 star servants and a ridiculous amounts of 
useless craft cards. I love this game but after a while you're going to get 
tired of chasing your own tail"
Rate up is a lie 120 sq no arturia
"Slow gameplay. Gatcha rates are meh. And the customer support is horrendus. 
Unlike every other game on this platform you CANT link your fgo account to 
anything, so if you accidentally delete it and dont remember every single 
damn detail of your game theyll flat out refuse to give your account back. 
It took a coworker over two weeks of wrestling with these people to get his 
account back. I cant get mine back wvwn thiugh i SHOWED THEM RECIEPTS OF MY 
SAINT QUARTZ PURCHASES. Spend your time on a gatcha game that actually 
cares about its players."
"I have played this game for over 8 months now and after the most recent 
update I lost my account t I am super disappointed and there is no way to 
get back what I worked for. Probably not going to play any more"
"Fun game, crashes every time my phone resets, and I can't figure out how to 
bring my previous account back when I Uninstalled and reinstalled to fix 
the app, now my account and all my characters are lost and I don't want to 
start over again."
I love me some anime waifus
"It's fun I don't buy nun on here cause I'm not that much into it to do so 
but I just wanna ask can u guys make a David and Goliath Theory"
"This game is absolutely great except for a few aspects though. It takes a 
lot of time to get just one Saint Quartz and sometimes you don't even get a 
Saint Quartz but a Chest. Maybe if the Saint Quartz obtaining was a bit 
easier. Also the summons are difficult to obtain anything good and even 
having paid only summons isn't nice on f2p players. This game is semi p2w 
and semi f2p, but overall it's a good game."
"Soonge Winge once said, ""Oh look a super-rare .jpeg! A thousand dollars 
well spent."" 10/10 would throw my college fund at the nasuverse again."
"The problem with this game isn't content or quality. It is the near 
predatory rates for the Gacha machine. The general results of each pull 
leaves much to be desired because it does not make it easy for you to gain 
a good pull without spending an exorbitant amount. While the game cannot be 
said to be poorly made (it has a very nice concept, I do not recommend it 
to anyone who came for their favorite character or to satisfy their urge to 
pull. It won't end well for you."
"An amazing game with cool animations , a great storyline , and a really fun 
play style . I will probably never touch it ever again due to losing my 
account that had Gilgamesh on it though"
I am in love
Game froze and purchased in game currency. Not amused.
"Started playing this game since January of 2018 and haven't stopped since. 
Being a f2p player especially has its merits because the game is very harsh 
on you with gacha rates allowing players to realize that some low star 
servants can be really good too. With a pretty unique battle system, there 
is lots of strategy involved in every battle that you have. Now that I've 
picked this game up I don't think I'll ever be able to put it down. Send 
help üòÇ"
"You could have made a dozen GREAT games out of the fate series but this is 
what we get...."
It was a awful game in my opinion
"This game is amazing and it's very easy to play also the summoning is hard 
if you want a 5* servant but overall it's a pretty good game"
"This is the best mobile game that I have ever played. The gameplay is easy 
to learn yrt surprisingly deep, I am never punished for decisions I make, 
the story is fantastic and there are plenty of events that keep the game 
fresh and exciting. The summon system grts a bit pricey if you want to gun 
for a certain person ($700 usd for jalter lol), however money spent is 
justified since the balance in this game is amazing. Every character you go 
for roll stay relevant many many years to come so your money is 
justified.... Basically a waifu simulator with good gameplay and story 
elements."
Altria
"I'm really enjoying the game so far, I've cleared the story and can't wait 
for more. It's nice to have a few of my favourite servants and get to see 
brand new ones- the profile pages are incredibly informative and 
interesting. In 9-12 months, if I don't have a 5* servant, then I'll start 
to complain about the summoning rates. UPDATE: received my first two 5* 
servants in under 6 months of playing. Very happy with this gacha rate. 
This game is less strategic at the beginning due to the Support Servants 
basically clearing whole rounds, but by the middle of the story content 
you'll find yourself needing to use a lot of tactical thinking and take 
into account what type of enemies you'll be fighting to plan out effective 
strategies. My only complaint is that the game is constantly (once every 
1-2 hrs.) giving me notifications telling me that my energy is full when it 
isn't. All around a great game, will absolutely recommend to my friends and 
family."
"Another game where we get shafted in favor of the Japanese audience. The 
game is enjoyable but we get less and less of what Japan gets. Less 
currencies and rewards. I'm not going to recommend a game that treats us 
like second class citizens because were not Japanese. Edit: every server 
gets the same rewards except ours. So I don't understand their motive."
"WAYYYY TOO EXPENSIVE TO PLAY Pros: It's ""FREE"" It's a fate/stay game Cons: 
It's way over priced for the crystal (in game paid credit) No way to get 
better characters"
Game is great
Probably the best rpg game to date (in mobile) but this is still hell
I love FGO
"It has an incredible story, split into several arcs, beautiful graphics and 
art, and complex characters. The gacha rate may be low but the game makes 
sure you can get through it even when using low rarity servants."
"I'll give 5 stars once u fix thr data lose problem everyday at exactly 8pm 
I lose all my data I can't keep doing this everyday just to redownload all 
ur data back"
Stronger
"Try again later... Nice gameplay and awesome graphics.  Unfortunately, runs slow on my device (LG G3) with visible lag/stutter.  Also, long load times between battles.  I really want to enjoy this game, but at the moment it's not smooth/playable for me.  Getting a new device in the near future; will give it another try at that time."
Game doesnt open after many reinstalls
The game doesn't even start after downloading!
"The game is funish, but the rates in this game are worse than any other 
game i've played. I'd enjoy it more if you guys didn't have such crappy 
rates. I expected more from Aniplex."
"I can't play the game ... Because when I patch it and the game forced close 
when it goes to 100% and when I try again, it will start over to 0% and 
forced close again at 100% Please help me ! I really love this game :("
Hood
"Loved the game,"
Love the game it's fun to play
"Couldn't even get the game to install and play. Tried twice to re-install 
and it never worked once"
"I'm actually looking forward to play this game, I have been a fan of the 
Fate series but the in-app download is so slow. I have a decent connection 
and storage. Not really sure what the problem is. I hope it gets resolved. 
I really do wanna play this game."
"Honest a great game I believe. While gacha rates may be low, others aspects 
of the game pretty much compensates it. (STILL it is frustrating to be f2p 
player and spend all the saint quartz earned, doing 30-50 summons yet no 
SSR servants)"
"A great game disappointingly ruined by greedy practices and non-existent NA 
support."
Mu·ªëi
"The game is very good, great art, story, characters, soundtrack and 
animations. It's also completely viable to play it without spending money. 
My rating is low because the management of this version of the game has 
been incredibly subpar. Slow content updates, lack of communication, 
delaying events just so they have stuff to announce at expos, giving fewer 
rewards than what the original version had, horrible or non existent PR, 
and the list goes on. With all the money this game makes hiring a better 
team to handle it is way overdue."
Anniversary delayed for two weeks.  20 fewer SQ than JP got.
We get shafted. Go play JP version.
"For the love of all that is Fate, DO NOT play this game. This game is 
murdering anything Fate and Type-Moon related. Do not support this game."
"The game is fun and has a deep, rich story telling adventure. The only 
downside is the summon rates for 5 star servants, but gacha games are lile 
that. Would recommend for any Fate fan."
I cant open the game :( please help
"For some reason i can't open the game up on the phone i just upgraded it 
seas it was error 48 I think? Please help me fix the bug so I can get back 
to playing. Thank you."
"Finally was able to play it great job at the customer support. Wonderful so 
long as you don't frustrate yourself with the gacha."
"Love the story and characters, beautiful sound track. It's worth giving a 
shot"
"This is such a wonderful game that I don't want to lose all my progress. Is 
there any other way I can retrieve my account"
"I really enjoyed playing this game for the first few weeks. But it really 
sucks when you use all your saint quartz that you rarely get or mana 
prisims (summon ticket is 20 mana) on Summons just to get 3 star servants 
every time. I must have summoned at least 50 times and have yet to get a 
single 5 star only receiving 3 4 star servants. IM OUT"
"I was having some trouble getting the game to run for a couple of days but 
customer service took care of it quickly and completely. They even restored 
my login bonuses I couldn't collect while the game wouldn't run. A huge fan 
of the Fate series and this game"
"It's a fun game, but I was very disappointed with their False advertising 
on Summoning packs. Paid money to get a 10x summon that said 1 4 star 
summon spirit guaranteed and I didn't get one. Was extremely disappointed. 
üëé"
The game to roll for your waifus and husbandos.
Greatest game ever
"While the few first few chapters or singularities dont have the greatest 
story, in fact pretty average. Camalot, the 6th singularity, blew me away. 
The pacing was great along with superb character development that not only 
made the singularity's supporting cast likable, but made the main 
antagonist understandable. The writing is colorful and briming with 
entertainment, this is even more true with events where usually the serious 
tone is droped for a more comedic one. As for gameplay. While the game does 
have a strategically design. You wont really have any trouble until the 6th 
singularity, where stragies start to matter more and you cant mindlessly 
force your way through everything. But it is still fun and engaging either 
way, simply more challenging after the 6th singularity. The character 
designs are wonderful and if youre a fan of natsuverse, (fate/anything, 
kara no kyokai, ect); most of these characters and more are here. More 
being added regularly. So you can get your favorite character or find new 
ones. But the gacha has a very low chance on giving you the rare waifu 
characters some would want unless you are willing to use some cash. But 
even the low tier (essentially free) servants (characters) are usefull 
(some dramatically better than the rare waifus). Cu is best bro in every 
way possible btw, only guy I would be with if I was gay. Overall this is 
the only phone game that I have not and plan on not droping unlike so many 
others and would recommend this to any one that has intrests in anime or 
simply would want a time sink."
love this game..
"great graphics and the animation is dope. make a prioritize friend list so 
we can select our certain friends... for friend points."
Love it and it is addicting
These game is awesome
"Normally I don't take to gacha games easily - I get frustrated and lose 
interest fast, it's not uncommon for me to uninstall a game within days, if 
not hours. But I won't lie, I think I've found a gem in this game. I heard 
about it prior to its NA release and found myself hooked on the concept and 
the available characters. I'm very much invested in the story and I can't 
wait see what's in store for us next! Well, we *do* know, the JPN version 
has been out for years and we have a dang good roadmap, but I can't wait to 
personally experience it myself."
"It's ok if u want to burn time. It was recommended to me by my brother 
cause we both like the anime but it is da*n near impossible to get any 
character you actually want. It is mostly cross your fingers and hope you 
don't get more garbage. Probably going to uninstall if there are other fate 
series mobile games, if not looks like I will be stuck with this one.üò†"
Love it so much
My only problem is the lag
"Awesome game I have changed my rating since the loss of my account the team 
at fate helped me kindly recover my account despite my previous complaints. 
This game is awesome I have never been so in love with a game before ever. 
I always find myself thinking about it wanting to come back 2 play it. 
Solid 5/5"
"Karna-kun, please come to my Chaldea! („ÉéÔæü–îÔæü) But truly, You guys should 
download this game (especially if you're a fate fan)."
Very good game overall.
"Amazing as a Fate game, bad for your wallet"
"A fun game, with great characters and great story. However, the drop rates 
for 5 star (or even 4 star) are too low, and the game is too grindy with no 
auto mode."
"Wont open on my brand new android lg phone. Just makes me send a email to 
support"
"The RNG for 5 stars in this game is so low that I feel like winning in 
bingo or any other gambling is much more realistic than getting 5 stars in 
this game but despite of that, the game is still fun, not gonna lie"
Hektor of Troy is my dad now and I love him thanks fate for my dad
"This company has the stingiest drop rates 6 months and no 5* the game is 
fun but even if u plan to spend money don't expect anything good to drop"
the game is hard to d.l pls fix this game cause it isreally fun to play
"I'm a huge fan of the series and this game just freezes a lot of fights my 
love for the series but trying to get a decent 4-star servant like Nero 
Claudius saber alter or saber Lily is whey tedious and annoying also 
there's no other way to retrieve your data but all and all its a good game"
"I love this game. The combat system is elegant and throws just the smallest 
bit of strategy into every move. The graphics are beautiful. The gacha has 
terrible chances, but I never spend money on mobile games so i resigned 
myself to luck to begin with. The biggest flaw, as many have stated, is 
that it crashes constantly with Android. Every story mission has caused 
crashes. I'll wait a few days, then, if i try with an amazing data speed, i 
can play a mission, then it crashes on the next one. Leaving the review 
mainly to state that whatever issue there is with Androids isn't exclusive 
to this newest OS update. I'm running Android 6.0.1 and i have the same 
issue. TL;DR The Android crash problem is also happening on my 6.0.1 OS so 
the problem isn't just the newest update."
"If game is accidentally uninstalled without writing down transfer code you 
have to start ALL over again. Please add an option to link either with 
Facebook or Google Play so that transfer codes aren't needed or at the very 
least needs a player's I'd number and Password. 1* until that happens 
because after transferring once my phone rebooted itself and deleted the 
app so now I can't play anymore"
"it has really great animations, characters and story, but the fights are 
fun at first then it turns to be quite repetitive after a while."
"The JPN server is good, Gacha rate is hell but it's OK ü§îüëå ps. I don't 
play EN server"
"Solid game play for a mobile app. Although the drop rate for legendary 5 
stars is 1%. That is a lot lower then other games like fire emblem heroes 
which starts at 3% for focus 5 star and another 3% for other 5 stars."
I loved the anime and this has been wicked fun
"I keep receiving the ""App did not launch properly"" message and even if I 
select ""No"" when asked to clear cache the app starts downloading something 
but it always closes by itself withoutbeven completing the download."
"great game until the latest update which ruined my gameplay experience with 
unfathomable connection error which never seems to be fixed anytime soon. 
Played for a long time already, really devoted to the game but also so 
close to dropping"
Mah waifus
"Honestly, I played it for about 6-7 hours in total and thought it was a 
boring grind."
pay 4 the good stuff
"The gameplay is rather intuitive for a turn-based system, and it never really feels like I have to rely too heavily on premium servants. In fact, what really sets this game apart from your typical gacha game is how well the budget servants compete with the premium ones. Though there is an advantage to getting said servants, it is completely unnecessary no matter what stage of the game you're in. The events are also pretty enjoyable and makes it a lot easier for beginners to progress.  Normally I dislike energy systems in games because I don't like being told when I can and can't play, but as long as you still have story content to plow through, you probably won't run out anytime soon. Sadly enough, there are daily login enticements, but they won't take up more than 5 minutes of your time, and the daily quests aren't necessary either (unless there's a servant you need to level).  The story is not great, but not bad either. It does have some interesting plot elements and the characters are okay. I haven't progressed to that point just yet, but I heard Nasu himself (the original creator of Fate) does write the later parts of the story, and I'm pretty hyped for that!"
Its pretty fun!
Will not load
Great story. Good gameplay. Gacha hell. You know when you finished the main quest then have new servants and wanted to try out new strategies on the main bosses or want to just have fun replaying those? I don't.
"It's really frustrating. I put a lot of time and money into this game, but 
my phone broke, and since I didn't have a code written down that I didn't 
even know existed, I can't recover. I have the same Google play account, 
Facebook, etc. But this game uses none of those, so there's just no way for 
me to recover what I lost. I miss playing it, but I'm not willing to 
restart after all of that."
"can't even play it! sends me email saying that I can't play it in my 
environment, what does this even mean?"
"It installs but when i go to open the app its pulls up my email app and had 
a emial composed to the game"
"Amazing game for any fan of the nasuverse franchises. Plenty enjoyable and 
addictive, enough so that I've played it every day since the first week of 
release. Starting out is tough while adjusting to game mechanics and 
beginning your everlasting war with the relentless gacha, but everything is 
smooth sailing once you land a handful of SR and SSR heroes. For serious 
players, whaling helps, but a good schedule can overshadow it"
"I love this game, but now it just won't open anymore. It keeps downloading 
even after I've already done it once, and it takes longer and longer each 
time. I don't have time to wait for this, so now I just can't play it."
"Starts fun. Plot gets almost impossible around Act 3. Character level cap 
means you can't just grind up additional levels without farming materials, 
some of which aren't available until you advance the plot. I end up relying 
on ""friends"" with level 90 chrs more than i should. Edit: recent updates 
have made this a crashfest. Difficulty of latest plot level seems designed 
to force you to use saint quartz to complete levels. Unskippable animations 
make this game an adjunct to some other activity. Maybe I'm just over it 
but it's not fun any more."
Great game and is friendly towards f2p players
Love this game very close to the anime which I love!!
Ok I Love fate grand order
"The game is very fun. Every update and new servants make it better. Can't 
wait for the game to be fully caught up with what Japan has."
Umm update and fix everything please thank you
One of the best game that I have play on smartphones
5 stars
If you love the fate series then this is the game for you.
"Well...it was fun at first but then I couldn't even launch it. It would say 
that it wasn't launched properly and that I had to reinstall. After ten 
attempts I got frustrated and decided to move on."
Please fix loading time for battle. Recent update rrslly slowed it down.
Waifus 4 laifu!
"Can't open the game anymore, it doesn't work on Android P yet."
"It's good, but why is it unavailable in the eu?"
"If you're a fan of the Fate series, this is what you've been waiting for."
The game won't open
"I was waiting for this game for a long time and it was everything that i 
expected it would be, the only problem is that when i updated the app it 
keeps showing downloading then suddenly stops and i have to restart it all 
over again i hope they fix this."
"This game is great, and one of the best games I've ever played in my life, 
but I wish that it was playable on a chromebook, as I have lots of apps on 
mine from the play store, but some of them aren't compatible. I wish this 
game was compatible for chromebooks."
"I already updated it, but every time i opened it, i need to redownload the 
update"
"I downloaded this app for the first but it wont open. It turned out to be 
100% on DL the game data and after that it wont open and it would take me 1 
hr just to redownload the game data and clearing the cache again. Pls 
resolve this problem cause im so excited to play this game. Thanks"
Goob
"It is true that the gacha system for this game is rather broken - approx. 
1% chance to get a 5 star card (highest star/rarest). But they do give you 
a lot of FREE premium currency. You can play and get good charactsrs 
without spending any money, unless you are impatient and can't wait."
Finally got my waifu Medusa
"So much fun! They're constantly updating the game and giving players fun 
new stories and events."
"Good story even if long at points. Hard to get 4,5 star characters if you 
dont plan on spending money compared to other games I've played, but 
doesn't matter in the end as almost all the fights are pretty easy if you 
have freinds with op characters."
Good story terrible rates for summons
Doesn't work with usb debug mode on.
"If you're a fan of Fate, you're probably already playing this game and 
loving it as much as I do. If you're not a fan of Fate, go watch Fate/Zero 
then come play this game and love it as much as I do."
"I keep being told to redownload but when i do the game crashes then when i 
launch it again its telling to redownload"
"Love the fact the fact that the characters have a real historical 
background."
Fun. Addictive. Repetitive.
Just love it very great game.
Thanks to the new update i lost every bit of what i had
"Fun and addicting. Easy to pickup, hard to master."
"I SPENT 500$ AND DIDNT EVEN GET WHAT I WANTED SCREW THIS GAME DO NOT GET IT 
ITS A MONEY PIT"
"Magus(Master) and Heroic spirit (Servant) Fight in the Grand Order to 
reclaim our Future."
OMG! Thank you for the availability here in our region. I'm so happy.
What can I say it's Fate.
Rate Up is Not a Lie
"Great phone game. Dont need the rarest characters to do the hardest 
content, and you dont need multiple copies of the rare characters for them 
to be great."
Very beautiful game
"This game does so much right, sadly it does even more wrong. Hands down the 
worst gacha system available. Terrible rates guarantee you wont get your 
waifu unless you are extremely lucky or spend a lot of money. They are 
extremely stingey with free quartz and the rates mean even the few free 
draws you get will be worth nothing. Even if you save for a 10 roll with 
free quartz you cant help but think 'that was 30 dollars worth of quartz, 
for nothing.' Do yourself a favor and play Granblue instead."
GACHA GAME MORE LIKE NO
"Pretty decent game. But it sux that I have to count on the Support servants 
so I could win a Grand Battle xd"
"It's okay, but to be powerful you have to be a whale."
"Great story and gameplay, but brutal f2p mechanics (gacha)."
"Great gameplay i like this i share it to my friends because it's so amazing 
but when i summoning always craft no servant"
Im kewl wit it naw
Rate-up is a LIIIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!!
"Gacha is bad civilization but I'm a fate fanatic. Good story, nice art, 
great story."
"Why are we here? Just to suffer. This is a fight to take back our 
waifus/husbandos. :v"
"Huge revolving cast of personable characters. Enjoyable storylines, with 
plenty of moments of humor. Tons of anime based on the characters"
"Can't even celebrate their own anniversary, saving it for a con a week 
later. Their PR department will disappoint you to figurative and literal 
tears. Abandon hope all who enter here."
I see Rin I download
"It's definitely a fun game, however because it has a gatcha system it's 
entirely luck for you get who you want. So because of that I can't 
recommend it to everybody, I can say that a friend and I play almost 
constantly and we have a great time."
"It has Iskandar 5/5 would roll again (you will probably have to with the 5* 
rates)"
"There are so many great characters in fate! Even if you don't roll the 
character you want in the game, you get plenty of quartz from playing the 
story and loging in consistently. It can be grindy at times, but it's fun 
to collect event exclusives and fight big bosses with your party."
"Love the game, i'm just kinda sad about the high price for quartz..."
Simply fantastic!
I've really no reason to hate this game.
"Overall a good game where you have to think about what you're doing and 
can't just autopilot the way through. Balance is alright and while the 
Gacha System is too unforgiving in my opinion, it is very possible to clear 
the required or even challenging content without spending a dime."
best game 10/10. but rip money. still. good.
Most enjoyable money pit on the market
"Gacha sucks but that's nothing unique to this game. The story and turn 
based RPG combat are enjoyable and plenty of likable characters to collect."
"Very angry now that camelot banner ends at 7th july instead of 11th july. 
This is a clear attempt in forcing players to spend before the discount on 
quartz packs we all know are coming. I will never, ever forgive aniplex for 
this. Boycott Aniplex!"
"Beautiful, seamless game with great mechanics. Love the story line. Love 
that this game doesn't force you to do in app purchases. Love that 
developers put thought into every detail to cater for even people on the go 
whereby if you exit the game in the middle of a battle you have an option 
when you load the game to start back from that very point that were in the 
battle. Great job!"
"This one has some big pros and big cons. Short version: it's big, fun, and 
interesting, but pricey if you're a waifu collector. The bad stuff first. 
An obnoxious energy system that pretty harshly limits play time (items can 
mitigate this). A lot of the art, while definitely high quality, is aimed 
squarely at the teen boy audience. Very few women in GO (or gender-swapped 
men, which are quite common) seem to have working knowledge of pants. An 
overpriced gacha system with the odds I think I've ever seen. It costs 3 
bucks for a single summon with a 1% chance of landing a 5 star character. 
If you're prone to getting hooked on rng, I'd suggest you stay away from 
this one. The good It's got tons of content, and you don't have to pay if 
you don't want to.You can get through even the high end gameplay without 
those pricey 5 stars. Solid strategy gameplay and art, as long as you're 
down with the T&A. Free summons, as long as you're patient. The odds still 
suck. Tons of events and free characters that are actually quite good. A 
story, though the writing is often...odd. It's very japanese, and so prone 
to having things get lost in translation."
Best fate game ever
I love the game and as a Fate fan you did really a great job well done
"For now its good. I can clear the whole story as f2p. Im here for the 
story. i love the okeanos part. Maybe add some side story about the 
servants i think it will be a good idea to put in the game and i like the 
idea of world boss we cleared in onigashima. Aside from that you should 
also change the drop rates for the ascension materials in the daily quests. 
ALl in all good game. Aside from the rate of the gatcha"
Best Game!!! Interesting Servants!!! Splendid Animation!!!
I fell in love with fate n so far the game is great
This game is great just like the anime love it all the way
"the game's fine overall, the story is pretty OK, gameplay is pretty good, 
but gacha hell makes it rough for some of us players. localisation for 
english is not the best, you can understand the story fine regardless. game 
requires lots of grinding and effort if you want to maximise events-based 
rewards ingame."
"I play over on the JP version, and I'll tell you, it doesn't get much 
better in the gacha department. I liked that this version had some QoL 
changes (that JP got much later on) from the get go, putting players at a 
better advantage than JP had starting out. Content can be cleared with any 
rarity servant; takes putting effort into team building and leveling those 
servants to their utmost. The one change that the gacha needs to do, to 
head in a better direction, is separate craft essence and servants"
Great anniversary event sure loved my nothing.
Can you add more new fate evens
"I love this game! My absolute fav. Just keeps getting better and better. 
Sometimes your lucky sometimes your not."
"I LOVE THIS GAME!!! as a fan of Fate series (anime)i am enjoying this game 
so much..."
THIS GAME IS SOOOO GOOD I DO POOPOO
Hope they will inprove fgo rate up
"A very exciting and jam-packed game awesome graphics and gameplay and it's 
very addictive"
"Very poor game... the story is terribly overwritten and it belittles women, 
calling them ""servants""... terrible game and not even fun gameplay 
mechanics. The battle systems basically a match 3 and the winner is whoever 
spent the most money/time leveling heir servants"
"It broke my phone, I had to go to save mod and delete it."
"frustrating most of the time opens my email for error codes even my device 
is not rooted besides the constant lags and crashes"
"So far so good i been enjoying my 2 weeks of gameplay and with luck i got 
my first ssr servant keep it up guys :)"
The game looks beautiful and the gameplay is pure RPG.
"Can't say much about the game, only that it never got past the loading 
screen. It just freezes there, I even reset my phone to see if that would 
help, but it didn't."
"the one and only my proble since transfer data from my old device is gap 
blackbar inbetween navbar on 18:9 screen"
I haven't even played it but 5 stars because itz fate
"I was not prepared for how addicting this game would be... This is my first 
ever gaccha game, so I've fallen hard down the rabbit hole. Enjoy! You have 
been warned!"
"Let me preface this by saying I've found myself wanting to whale on the 
regular. I'm seriously hooked on this game. Other than having a very 
memorable character (Arturia Pendragon) being incorrectly named Altria (A 
Tobacco Company) this game is very addicting, pun intended, and the visuals 
are stunning. Maybe they'll fix the spelling for the legendary king of 
knights in an update eventually. The Saint Quartz used to summon heroic 
spirits (odds are crazy hard, so getting a 5‚òÜ servant is VERY satisfyingly) 
are ridiculously over priced and there is an over abundance of QP through 
AP quests. Unfortunately, there is no way to exchange QP for Saint Quartz. 
This would be another great update idea (Exchange QP for Saint Quartz in 
the store?). I'm continually waiting for my AP to recharge while cringing 
every time I summon another Demon Boar. Keeping all the things above in 
consideration, this game is seriously the best mobile game I've ever 
played. The story's constantly being updated with an endless amount of 
things to do."
"They should give us more saintquarts üò¢üò¢üò¢ especially for the free 2 play 
players"
"It is a fun game great to get intoduce to amazing mythologies from all over 
the world"
"All these people saying its pay2win meanwhile the only servant u need to 
own is herc with his bond10 CE and u're basically good to go for 2 years... 
building a team of non ssr servants is what makes this game fun rather than 
finishing a challenge quest with ssrs. You need brains to play f2p in this 
game and that's what makes it fun."
"Game is fun but the Gacha is EXTREMELY brutal! Like i really wish they 
would separate the servants and essence Gacha besides putting them together!"
I really like the game specially the battle ones
"The Game is fun to play even though its far behind from the Japanese 
servers. Though the gacha is probably the worst even during rate ups 
compared to other gacha games the gameplay is more fun than a lot of other 
jp games"
"I would give this game five stars but the abysmal drop rates and lack of 
currency to pull keeps it from being perfect."
So amazing!üòçüòçüòç
"I really love FGO. It is an awesome game and offers just a whole lot of 
content and stuff to do. FGO is definitely my favorite mobile game."
"Omg GREAT job guys I usually get bored of games like this very quickly but 
with this one it hasn't happened it has a AWESOME balance between storyline 
and game play which really helps me stay in the game.. Time just Flys by 
while I'm playing it its alot more fun then I thought it was going to be! 
It's not to bad on my battery either I can usually play for hours before I 
need to charge it so again AWESOME job guys keep up the GREAT work I look 
forward to what comes in the future."
Great gameplay and story for a F2P mobile game.
"Had a data transfer issue. I've been playing this game for a month already 
but can't play it anymore because of data transfer issue. Contacted your 
email and Facebook support but no one helped me. Fix your customer service."
Yea
OMG!!! I really love this game!!!
"Gameplay is fun, story and characters are interesting. Summon rates aren't 
the best, but I can live with that. I'd recommend this to any Fate fans."
"I really like the game a lot and the characters are cool and the story is 
fun and funny."
"I actually played when the game first released,I ran into some problems and 
had to uninstall and just got around to reinstalling. But now my file is 
compleatly gone. I spent a bit of money on the game and wanted to know if 
there was anyway to get my file back. Please help"
At least the doujins are good
"Sound is distorted on Galaxy S9+, both with and without headphones. Forced 
to play muted."
It doesn't let me play it go straight to send to message
"Nice gameplay but really hard to get an SSR servant. Even though you're 
just an F2P, you can still enjoy the game. Grind for your waifus."
Thank you for not censoring anything.
"As a huge fan of type-moon, I've enjoyed this game thoroughly, but it 
stutters and lags quite a bit, and the microtransactions are somewhat 
ungenerous, in my opinion."
"Not enough action points for quests. You get one saint quartz per mission 
but each mission has 2,3 or even 6 stages. So getting 30 saint quartz for 
summoning takes a crazy amount of time. Games a good time waster but not 
worth spending money on."
I got my waifu Anne Bonny so I'm all good.
"save yourself, dont spend money"
"It's a very good, interesting game"
"I wanted to play the game because I was inspired but it wasn't working in 
this device.. I was so looking forward to playing it but then it said that 
there was a problem"
"Really addicting game but the abysmal rate of the servants sometimes 
irritates me because farming for quartz is really hard but it's a different 
story for whalers though.But Nonetheless is still one of the best game I've 
played."
Never has a game made me feel more miserable. 5 stars.
Needs thousands of dollars to keep up. Not fun.
"I love this game it has almost all the legendary battle in different times 
to fight for a great treasure the holy grail"
"It is a terrific game! Fate Grand Order has an intriguing storyline and 
great characters. I find it very addicting"
Fate game nuff said.
It doesnt work in SEA
"This game is a gem that is only held back by the worst gacha system period. 
Other games will on occasion reward players with the coveted 5-star, but 
the only solid chance of you getting one is on the guaranteed banners... 
and the last one was 7 months prior to this posting (not to mention it had 
to be paid currency, and their ""freebie"" add-ons to when you buy don't 
count). If this game had a gacha system like Fire Emblem Heroes, this would 
be definitively the best rpg with a gacha. But it doesn't and it has a bad 
one instead."
"Game has a lot of potential however is let down by very long startup and 
loading times"
Love it because medusa
Best mobile game in history.
Bestoo gameoo
Too many events back to back I need some rest. Otherwise 5*
I enjoy this excursion into the FATE series.
"I truly love this game, but ever since the maintenance I haven't been able 
to get my game to load. I don't want to uninstall the game because it's 
such a fun and interesting game so if you con fix the issue I will gladly 
give a stellar review. Thank you."
It's freaking awesome
Fate weebs like this. Dankest dungeon with waifus
This is the best mobile game out there.
"I haven't spent a dime and I have a gold in every slot. It's not pay to 
win, and I have few complaints. All of them are minor. Its fantastic in 
every way, and fate fans will enjoy it even more!"
Draw rate is terrible!
Release it on asia pls
Waifu simulator
I'm gamer mad
Servant class: Master Noble Phantasm: Multi-summon Luck: E
Fun and easy game for the casual player
It's definitely worth giving a try but then you might not stop playing.
Evil money sucking life draining gain. Gacha is a lie.
MAMA RAIKOU!
"It's a great game of strategy. If you like the fate series, then you'll 
like this game."
I love this game üòçüòç
It have everything that made Fate great.
Best app there is. Better than FFBE or GBF
A great game from a great series.
Best gacha game I've played
Very fun and addicting game
My favorite servants is here oh my so cool!
Fun game. Very addicting but can get repetitive. Love the art.
Freaking amazing
"Great game, no ads and they never ever shove down your throat with pay to 
win or anything of the sort you can play this game 100% for free and have 
everything it offers"
"Fgo is genuinely fun to play but for a gacha game it is a money milking cow 
with abysmal gacha rates. Gacha rates are always 1% and only rate ups 
exist. Gameplay and story is great but it is carried by the fact it is part 
of the fate franchise. I got my first ssr 4 months into the game f2p. Give 
up on pulling ssrs unless you have over 300 quartz. It feels like there is 
so little care for this game and it's fanbase especially for up. The worst 
gacha game but I love the characters and I know I will never get them 
unless I save for 6 months or whale."
F2P forever
Make it forever and generous XD
WELCOME TO HELL!
"great franchise but the game is severely lacking compared to how great this 
series is , story is fine , but gacha rates are abysmal , game is a 
grindfest timesink"
RIP wallet.
Just freakin great game!
Very addictive!
"Been waiting for years after jp release. Why not seperate sea server to na? 
Kinda cheated."
"I am the PAYER of my GATCHA. _____ is my CURRENCY and QUARTZ is my REWARD. 
Have withstood HUNGER for a THOUSAND HOURS. Yet, these hands will HOLD no 
5SSR. Not known to F2P, nor known to GRIND. So as I PAY. UNLIMITED WHALE 
WORKS!"
"Good game, terrible RNG. Perfect game for me."
Fun to use your favorites to progress through the story
It wouldn't be fun if it's not this salty
"Gacha sucks but would still play despite it, good game"
Why do I need USB debugging off
Focused to much on graphics that it barley functions
"Great game. Could be better if it had more ways for players to earn free 
saint quartz. The existing methods including events aren't sufficient if 
you want event limited servants/more servants. I find the game fun and 
entertaining."
"I used to play the game very frequently without any issues. Now that I am 
trying to get back in it keeps crashing. After the title screen it crashes, 
during a mission it crashes, even if I leave it open it could crash. I know 
my phone isn't the issue as I did not have this problem in the past. If 
this keeps up I don't think this will be worth my time anymore or the space 
on my phone. I'm expected to spend money yet the game doesn't work? Fix it!"
"As an anime fan and fate fan, I am glad that this game is made thank you"
"The drop rate of 5 star servants is low and it's hard to grind for quarts 
and it is expensive to buy"
"I have been playing for a while and i had fun. It is challenging and seeing 
how other people complete the story, with old characters compared to newly 
acquired ones, are awesome. But i agree with most people in saying that you 
need to fix the drop rate, it is too low."
"Very addictive but can be very frustrating especially if you don't get what 
you want."
"I wish there were more events to do that don't require us to beat all of 
the singularities. It too me around 3 weeks to beat okeanus. Other than 
that, it feels like a fate game"
DEVS need to up 5* drop rates
Great support replies within the day with genuine help <3
Great story mode
Game wont start on my galaxy s8+
I like this game it really good XD
"It's really good & I'm loving everything but the way the MTX is used, while 
I can understand why it's currently like it is now I wish it was split up 
to be able to roll randomly between each of the classes & CEs so it's 
better easier for players to have a chance to get what they want & not feel 
discouraged from playing cause of the MTX & RNG not playing in there favor 
& it feeling like & being wasted time and money also a slight decrease in 
the saint quarts needed to roll higher then 1 is also needed, if not any of 
that please give us a way to purchase servants directly, I love this game 
but more often than not I find myself not playing it cause I feel like I'm 
not getting everything I wanted out of it & that's purely cause of the way 
its MTX is structured, as a fan who wants to enjoy your game & support it 
please consider changing it."
"Once again, another huge middle finger to new players... Thanks for only 
giving me 3 gems after I got through the long and annoying tutorial... The 
least you bastards could do is let us use the 30 tutorial gems on an actual 
good banner! No one cares about the dumbass guaranteed 4 stars because 
they're garbage! You want me to play your game? Make it enticing instead of 
tedious!"
bruh fate grand orders amazing the gacha is fair if you drop money. its a money making game bro. suck it up and drop money. or sit there and accept your 3 stars and welfare servants and shut up. 5/5 love the salty f2p tears keep up the good work fgo.
"While not a bad game, your account is not linked to Google Play by default. 
I reinstalled the game thinking it would fix it. Turns out if you do not 
link your account typo can lose everything. Despite providing several 
points old data and a clear connection to my wife's account they refused to 
restore my account because ""some details didn't match"". This is nothing 
short of a scam."
"I have always enjoyed the series as well as the movies. So when my brother 
showed me this game I couldn't wait to get started. I'm giving a one start 
rating because when the latest update came my whole game started over. I am 
so disappointed. All time I spent for nothing. I'm so glad I never spent 
any money on it. If you are currently playing this game some advice write 
down everything or screen shot your information and cross your fingers that 
you never need to use them to verify your information."
"If I didn't have to keep reinstalling it every so often, it would be a 
little better."
"I'm only play this for Illya, Kuro plus waiting events is a painful 
experience. Hopefully I won't miss Magical Prisma event and good stuff. At 
least event mission are fair, don't have to farm alot to level up and beat 
it. Unlike other game event's ridiculous mission force time consuming and 
pay to win for new players."
Wish there was multiplayer!
"Fate/Grand Order gets a 5* for gameplay, and 1* for the monetization. The 
TL;DR version is that you should either plan on playing mostly free, or 
""whaling"" it and spending $100s maybe $1000 or more. To me, the value for 
your money is rather low. It's a blast to play, with a depth that rivals 
most PC games. From team composition to strategizing a battle, you will 
need to think hard when you need to maximize your performance. Also, I find 
the game's audio and visual detail to be great for a mobile game. FYI, it's 
voiced in Japanese and subtitled in English, with many ""visual-novel""-like 
cut scenes for the story aspects. However, the payment model is mostly 
based around a random ""gacha"" pool mechanic (i.e., pulling cards randomly 
from a deck). The odds of getting the best servant (5*) in the game is only 
1% per pull, and the chance for even a 4* is just 3%, so don't expect to be 
pulling them a lot. In fact, to even expect to pull one at all is a 
stretch. You'll get free pulls by playing, and maybe I've been lucky since 
I've managed 2 within 2 months. But here's the thing, if you want to buy a 
pull, each will cost in the range $1.71-3.00 (the cheapest if you buy in 
quantities of $80 at a time). And in comparison, if you buy $80 worth 
(which I equate to half a year of MMO subscription, or maybe a deluxe 
edition of a AAA PC game), you get almost 50 pulls. The odds of getting one 
or more 5* are just around 40%. And even if you include the odds of getting 
a 4 or 5*, it's just 87%. That's a lot of money for not a lot of outcome. 
Secondly, your play time is limited by an action point (AP) pool that 
scales linearly with your level. ANd I find my playtime once I reached high 
enough to start farming dailies to be significantly gated by this. In fact, 
at max level, you can only do (almost) 4 of the ""best"" dailies before 
running out of AP, and at my level after 2 months, can only do about 3. You 
get back AP at 1 per 5 min, and you can get a full pool by leveling up, so 
I find myself trying to optimize when I level. You can buy a full pool for 
$0.60-1.00, but to me, spending that much for maybe at most 15-30 min of 
playtime is just too much. It reminds me of the days when I played in an 
arcade.... Finally, in order to advance your servants, you'll have to 
farm/grind for materials, and this to me gets very tedious. Since drops are 
random, and you are never guaranteed a particular one, you can find 
yourself running the same mission over and over again with no apparent 
progresss, all the while spending your precious AP and having to stop when 
you're out. You'll find events are your best bet here, but since each are 
limited time and you need to get pretty advanced in one for the best mats, 
you'll find yourself needing to grind them out too. It's a shame that such 
a fun game is relegated to the ""mobile game monetization"" model, and 
moreover, that they've decided to tilt towards ""whales"" (i.e., those who 
spend tons of money) over a more casual playerbase. I'd certainly be 
willing to spend $5-10/month on this game, but that really gets you almost 
nothing except for certain times (I hear there are guaranteed pull events 
occasionally). My recommendation is that new players, unless you are 
expecting to be a ""whale"", play for free for at least a month or two, and 
get to about level 70+ along with a roster of free servants that are about 
level 40-50 before deciding on spending any large amount of money."
why i cant play this game.??im in philipines
"Being permanently behind JP server sucks. Other servers are catching up, so 
why cant we? Regarding the game, it's cool. Gacha may be hell, but as 
someone playing for only a month with 3 5 stars, I can definitely say it's 
all by chance. Getting a Scath after the update with 1 try using a summon 
ticket is pure luck too. Once you get those 5 stars you wanted anyway you'd 
realize 3 stars and below are also useful and strong. It just depends on 
how you plan your team. Though craft essences are a must and it's really 
hard to get a specific one that you need."
"Loved the game. Played a solid 6 months of it, only to accidentally delete 
it and lose everything...so disappointed..."
All i can say is this game is freaking amazing
"It won't load for me, but I downloaded it before and it was an excellent 
game...I just wish it would load for me now"
Waifu Waifu Waifu !!!!!
"2 complaints: 1st. The game likes to freak out when I place my device in 
USB Debugging mode, I'm sure there's a completely legitimate reason to 
block access to the game if a phone is in Debugger mode, but does it really 
need to open 20 Gmail applications in an attempt to send a debug email? And 
for clarity, I am a starving programmer and use my personal device for app 
development, which is why my phone is in USB Debug mode. 2nd. The combat is 
awe strikingly unique, but if I accidentally hit the hit button to choose 
my combat cards for my Servants, I'm locked into the attack mode without 
being able to back out and select skills, which is both annoying and 
disappointing. P.S. I love the game, the art, the story, the everything, 
besides those 2 complaints above and am looking forward to play more."
"my phone doesn't have run it perfectly, but fortunately it lets me restore 
my battle when I go back in. I love the. characters, and just the game in 
general."
I've had it since it came out in the US and it's one of my favorites.
Great for fans of Type-Moon and the Fate series
"Awesome game. The graphics is good, gameplay is awesome, and great plots 
too: The main story line, there's a new story line in every event, and each 
servant has their own ""Interludes"". I realy recommend this game, especially 
to those who's already a fan of the fate series."
"The game is garbage. Visually appealing, but the gameplay is oversimplified 
and boring. Storylines are linear. No depth to this game. Repetitive. And 
p.s. you can easily lose ALL of your gameplay and character cards. Don't 
waste your time and phone memory space with this game"
"Please fix game continues to freeze as you load the game up and slow 
loading times other than that the game is pretty fun"
"Love the game. Really expands on the show and the movie it's based on. If 
you played the first blood brothers game it's very similar. Just wish you 
could change the appearance of the Main characters. Only downside. I want a 
avatar to feel more connected."
Best mobile app aside from FFBE
Pls FGO come to my region
GACHHAAAA GACHAAAAA I NEEED MORREEEEEEEEE GACHAAAAAAA!!!!
"The worst summon rates of any phone game like it, it's 0.1% for a 5 star 
character (rate that is stated in-game). The prices for Saints Quartz (the 
in game currency used for summons) are much higher than any other gatcha 
games' currency and earning enough free Saint Quartz to summon takes far 
too much work just to attempt a summon and end up getting ten 3 star 
characters you've already gotten dozens of times in the friend points 
summons."
Cant even open the app. Apparently can't play from Malaysia.
"It's extremely unfair that you guys are not allowing China phones to run 
this game. I have been waiting for such a long time to play this game in 
english and as soon as I get it downloaded, I get stumped by error code 60 
even if my phone is clean from root or developer options. I do hope you 
guys can find a way to let everyone play. Its just not fair...."
"If you want to get your favorite characters and train them and make a sweet 
army this is not the game for you, getting a good character on your team is 
morbidly difficult unless you want to throw cash into this."
"Edited: THANK YOU! The support staff have finally brought my account back 
through around 11 or less emails? Still, it was good that I got it back."
It good i English very well
Summoning low chances made me dripped
"I absolutely love this game from mission one. Very well built and has a 
good plot. Five stars, best anime game on mobile, hands down. Could we 
perhaps see a Jeanne d'Arc Alter special offer in the near future? <3"
"Great and all, until you uninstall or move phones and can't get your 
account back."
Great RPG
Awsome sause
"I certainly like this game and I usually delete RPG games after like the 
first five minutes because I'm just not Interested in them. I like the fate 
series so this game clicked with me. Im just waiting for the Camelot 
update. PS. I REALLY WANT A ROMANCE WITH FREAKING MASH! I LOVE THAT SMALL 
BEAN!"
Red saber
"Lost all my stuff on fgo couldn't get it back, pretty pissed since I had 
oda nobunaga, tamamo no mae, kintoki and mordred no word on getting 
anything back, lost my stuff in February still waiting"
It's Wonderful.
"I love this game! I am not usually interested in RPGs, but I do like the 
Fate series and this game does a great job with its story and characters. 
And the support team for the game is wonderful! I had lost the game due to 
a phone issue and support had me back into my account within only a day or 
so!"
Pre good
More Servants and Events to come! ~ <3 Umu!
"At first I had problems playing the game but support was quick to respond 
and help me resolve my problem. Looking forward to playing it more."
"Great game but one thing my account got resetted I didnt do anything i 
didnt resetted or transfer my data can you guys pls help me recover my 
account?"
This game is like the dark souls of gacha games but it's fun
"There is one crucial flaw to this game they still haven't fixed... The game 
itself isn't all that bad however, they still haven't made any effort to 
make a new account system. I honestly hate the account system they have, 
it's garbage. More often than not you will lose your account. Making a 
simple link to any social media account or even goggle account should be 
implemented."
Game crashed before I could play.
Big fate fan so this is perfect.
"I used to love this game, then they robbed me of servants twice and didn't 
do a thing to help give them back. Once claiming that I didn't summon one, 
the other time saying that I sold one which I couldn't have. Customer 
Support didn't even try to help me out either. If not for that bad 
experience, I'd still love this game. Update: I have lost yet another 
Servant from my account. This one another limited event Servant. This game 
has robbed me yet again, and will rob you too if you try to play."
Issa good. Play it haha üëåüî•üíØüîûüë∫üîûüíØüî•üëå
"Im a fan of the anime and i am so hooked up with the story that i forgot 
that i have a job, soooo addicting.the only thing that slows me down is 
having low saint quartz hehehehe"
No Google Play & FB link to recover my old account. :(
"If I were you guys I wouldn't try to play this game it sucks take my word 
for it and I would strongly recommend not installed on your game on your 
cell phone or pad the summonings the rigged and I got proof of that"
"Full of ads every week for characters with a less than 1 percent drop rate. 
Free summon characters never rotate and are worthless. Cool game broken by 
an incredibly stingy buy in. Would have spent money on this if it weren't 
so terribly greedy."
I really love this game! supah strong!! best game ever.
"I was honestly decently excited about this game but upon installation it 
kept making me chose an app and when I did it kept trying to make me pay 
for something. Not sure what's up with that but I'll have to keep it 
uninstalled i guess."
"It's fate mobile, it's good"
love it the drop rate is the one problem
"Don't have to pay to get certain items. Instead, they give you quests to 
complete to earn them, which is nice.‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç"
"The story mode is long and drawn out for little reward. It is disgustingly 
hard to get the heroes you want if you're F2P. I literally had to fight 6 
separate substages to finish a stage that gave me a crappy chest. The game 
loads so slow for completing a substage, going back to the stage selection 
screen, then selecting the same stage."
"Cannot play on either of my devices. Crashes immediatly after start and 
wishes to open my email for some reason."
"Altogether great game! The Nasu-verse delivers for memorable characters 
based on historical icons or world folklore."
"Honestly, I love this game. Its probsbly close to addiction at this point 
but whatever. I love the fate franchise and this just gives me a constant 
feed of that!"
This is good and good story
"Doesn't even need to whale that much. Every playable unit are powerful, a 
very free to play friendly game!"
Crashes to much. Too much lag
Needs to incorporate the same rewards as the japanese version
"Hello, just an honest review of the game so far. Been playing for a few 
months since last Halloween and I can honestly say it is one of the best 
gacha games I have played. I will admit that there are some problems such 
so bugs, small translation errors, and the gacha drop rate is gacha hell.. 
With a 1% drop rate for 5 star servants, its much worse compared to other 
gacha games. If you're cheap to play, might as well wait for the 
anniversary or thanksgiving/new years gacha for a guaranteed 5 star. The 
grind can be a bit repetitive but taking a break can help ease that 
feeling. With that out of the way, the story, characters, and even events 
are all very good and side stories or interludes as they're called are 
pretty fleshed out and reward you for playing. And the easier to get or 
free servants from events are pretty damn good, and with good strategy and 
team building you can get through some pretty tough content. Overall a 
great solid gacha game that you should play BUT roll RESPONSIBLY.... The 
rates are hell. Just wish the campaigns they do were much better with more 
rewards for free to play."
Best story game and anime
It's a free real state
Doesn't work on Samsung note 8. Girls Frontline works fine.
"Not for free to play in the slightest. Game is extremely slow pace as well. 
The game's pace is what got me to quit."
Very low chance to get 5*s. Good story though.
"This version of app lag 2 years behind the original JP release, take that 
as you will. The developer went nuts with the app protection. This app is 
more of a pain to use than banking apps. On the other hand, the game itself 
is fun mix of gacha game and vn, especially if you like fate series."
"One of the few games I have no regrets paying real money to. The game is 
awesome. The events are great and the support is super. The only thing I am 
disappointed about so far is not getting my oni! Lol!;) That said may I 
suggest a slight mod to the ticket system; regular tickets being handled as 
they are now. Silver tickets with an increased chance of high level 
characters. Gold tickets good for 4-5 star characters awarded by special 
events. And diamond or platinum tickets good for a character of your 
choice. My thoughts. Keep up the great work!"
"Horrible game unless you can afford to pay $500+ for a good Servant. The 
amount of currency you get is limited and is basically a pay to win game. I 
wpuld gladly delete all of my account and lose access to the game for my 
money back. This game is a Scam!! Dont support it!!"
"This game is addictive specially to those who watch Fate series! Been 
playing this game for months now even before its official release in Google 
play I even got a 5 star servant just using a single summon ticket ( he 
he). Love this game!"
One word. Awesome!
Love it have a great team
An entertaining game that makes for a good time sync.
"Great grinding simulator and top tier art and voice acting. the story is 
fine and most of the events are hilarious. I play on the jp version most of 
the time but I still keep up my na account. The 5* unit rates are a bit bad 
and took me a few grand to np5 my favorites though."
"An update deleted my account info and when I emailed the company about it, 
they pretty much said they wouldn't do anything about it"
"Game is good. Gacha rates are terrible though. Remember not to waste too 
much money on your waifus."
"Game is extremely repetitive. Collecting heroes reliably requires real 
money. Some heroes can only be collected in limited time events. My 
previous phone died, and because I didn't data transfer I lost everything, 
including the $50 worth of shards, and the limited time hero's I did manage 
to get. Not worth the waste of time! Got play the real F/sn"
"Though I do wish the gotchas had better rates the characters and story 
makes up for it"
I'm uninstalling for space reasons but I might not be back
Gud Waifu Game
"I love the fate universe and I enjoy fate grand order. However I do have 
some issues with the NA version, where the prizes on the Facebook campaigns 
are only 3 SQ, and how slow the game has been progressing compared to the 
Taiwan, China, and Korean versions of the game, along with the amount of SQ 
and apples being given out is in much greater quantity than that of ours. I 
just hope that NA recurved the same treatment and QoL that the other Asian 
servers have been receiving."
"Great, great, and great This game it great"
Bugs. Crash phone constantly
Release global version
"This game deserves a full 5-star rating. Except it has one very big issue. 
The NA player base gets absolutely shafted in terms of rewards and the fact 
that it is permenantly 2 years behind the jp server. Every other server is 
catching up to jp, and is compensated properly for the accelerated 
schedule, but the feedback from us on this app goes completely ignored."
"Until AniplexNA and Delight Works gets their stuff together, I would not recommend anyone purchase stuff from this game. While it's a good game, especially for anyone who is already invested into Fate series, the NA version of this game suffers from horrible management compared to the Korean, Chinese and Taiwanese versions.   Firstly, the translations are outsourced to free lance translators. Many times the English translations are sub-par and suffer from glaring faults; It's as if no one reviewed it before publishing them. Secondly, our rewards are reduced, and sometimes even outright removed compared to the other regions. For example, in one of the events, Rashomon, we were supposed to get an additional limited skill upgrade material and a summoning ticket however they were removed completely. Thirdly, we have no absolutely no communication with the NA team in regards to any of this. They only post on their Facebook page with promotional events and our quartz giveaways are locked behind huge Facebook milestones which are ever increasing. Which does not happen in any other region.  There are many other problems with the NA release that needs to be addressed."
Crashed repeatedly
"uhmmm i want to play this game but i cant because whenever i try i am 
always stuck on a black screen and then after a while suddenly the game 
crashes and then automatically exits itself... please fix this bug."
Best game of your life because it's your life
"I might have an issue with the game,I put my transfer number and it says 
its in use. Can you fix that for me? Thanks."
"cant even open the game just a blank white screan and keeps opening gmail 
to send error report"
Cut scenes.....
"I love the game but it crashes every 3 to 5 minutes . That makes it hard to 
play"
"Well from the get go, I can't play the game, it just brings up for me to 
email them and I did, then they tell me I need to have an unrooted phone 
with all developer options turned off, which I do, I would believe a galaxy 
s7 could play this. It meets all requirements. It needs to be fixed."
I love the opening
Its a nice 2D sidescroller
"Well...there goes my time out the window....... still need a lvl 5 too :( 
gg would waste 3 hrs again."
Cant run my fgo? It keep say connecting
ÿ®ÿØ ŸÜÿ®ŸàÿØ
A really good game for the fans of Fate Stay Night xD
"It was a great game until I lost everything when I transfer to a new phone 
I try contacting the staff for help many time but i can seem to remember 
the detail I had I still remember all the heroic spirit I posses but that 
doesn't help I need the correct heroes I have in the team and the code and 
the year I got the game and me buying stuff doesn't help either so it was a 
great game while it lasted for me."
Pay 2 win garbage.
"I like the game, but someone that has watched the anime it kind of confuse 
me with the character plots, and things like that"
Needs an English dub track.
I can't even get it to run. And I love all the fate seasons. Please fix.
I Fate/Grand Order I watched the Anime First.
Fails to run on lineage
"A bunch of waifus, very well written story, and the mechanics are somewhat 
balanced."
"Depending on your luck and who your favorite is will most likely determine 
your experience with this game while the gacha hell is real it's a pretty 
fun rpg to play on the go or on break at work just remember your limits 
with gambling."
"I love this game. The rarity of servants has never been a huge problem for 
me because a 2 star caster can be as good as a 4 star and so on. My one 
complaint, though, is the limited time servants. I wish they were around 
longer. Other than that, great game!"
"I was not really planning to play the English Server because of the hectic 
schedule of the Japanese server but because of some unforeseen scenario 
like uninstalling my account and the bind code could only be used once and 
the Japanese service really sucks because you need to speak on their 
language and I am not sure if my account would be returned. I decided to 
give the English Server a try but I would really miss my favorite servant 
Chacha and if my JP account be salvaged I would return to my original 
server."
"It's a decent game, but the summon rates are horrible.."
"Can't even enter the game. Error 61 apparently, it says it is not available 
in my region which is obviously not true."
That's hell you're walk into.
"There is no auto and getting a 5 star servant is very very low since you 
have more of a chane to get 5 star craft essence instead. I have not gotten 
a single 5 star servant yet even when I did three 10 servant summon at once 
only 5 star craft essence."
"Best JRPG App game ever. FGO was the first App game that I spend money on 
and I have no regrets!"
"Love this game. Love the servants. Love the puns. I like how they have 
these very nice welfare/free servants in events. And while it's certainly 
can be tough at some points in the game, low tier servants can still carry 
you through. Translation could be better at some places but I understand 
the translation team is very small. Also I wish the price of quartz would 
be a bit lower. I did spend some money on the game but honestly the price 
is a bit much for Asian currency..."
"This review is a bit biased. I installed the game, launched the app, and it 
immediately crashes. I have no idea what it's like since it won't play."
"I think creature named ""Fou"" said ""Fou Kyu"" to me."
Awesome game! But still waiting on new servant animation update.
BEST FATE GAME EVEEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!!!üòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
"I very much enjoy the game but unfortunately it keeps crashing when I try 
to play it. In just 1 week it crashed 10 times."
"Decent game, but the drop rate for decent, even varied, Servants is pretty 
appaling here. A whole lotta craft essences, whole lotta junky double 
Servants. Don't waste money, it's ok for a free time waster"
Game feels great in a sense.im a sucker for Gacha systems ~
Can't wait for new servert
Game no longer works. Black screen after title screen.
The 2nd best game I have ever played
"Is blocked on Chromebook. Don't waste your time if you plan on playing it 
on one."
Salt salt salt
"This is an excellent game for nayone familiiar with the fate franchise, it 
is quite adducitive in its gameplay and story, but as of recently my game 
glitched when I tried a 10x saint quartz spawn and all my saint quartz were 
gone. I'd love to give this game a 5 star rating but this recent event has 
left a bad taste in my mouth."
"Fate/Series is my favorite anime. Finding a game about it, gahd dahmn 
aaaaaaaa."
Doesnt work for Oneplus One. Disappointed
I love the game but it need more optimization in some performance issues.
Great game but brutal gacha system
"Love the storyline and that you have an option of choice of dialogue. Easy 
to play battle concept. Awesome characters and Amazing Noble Phantasm 
graphics. Was sceptical but, now I'm hooked and have encouraged others to 
play this. Only improvements would be to add more basic battle animations 
gets repetitive and stale. Really makes you feel apart of the story a must 
play in my eyes."
"It's just ok. Gameplay is pretty repetitive and the events are just a 
grindfest. Graphics are great. Pulling for 4 and 5 star servants is 
horrible. Before they were forced to reveal the actual drop rates during 
rate up, they tried to get away with stating event 5 star servants were a 
1% drop but in actuality it was 0.7% so buyer beware. Check out some 
YouTube vids of guys pulling for a laugh."
"I love it, the whole thing. But the only setback is that when you 
uninstall, you can't return to where you were. And the situation where you 
pay to even get a good servant."
"Fun game with a good story but quarts cost way to much and spawn rates are 
terrible. Also very hard to lvl due to low drop rates for items. The 
summoning system is a joke, definitely a pay to win game and we're talking 
thousands of dollars. Not worth."
Grand Order
"Been playing for some months now and I'm enjoying the game. I honestly am 
surprised a Gacha game has been so good and has an amazing story with 
alluring waifus with huge plot. The grind drops when a new Event comes out 
and I like it. Only thing of course is FTP is not easy especially if you 
want some SSR servants. The general game content can be beat with the most 
common and easily acquired servants so that's great. Love the community 
too, always providing tips and helping out noobs like myself."
"Don't play this game unless you have money a lot i spend 190 saint quartz 
for nothing"
Great game overall! Even better if you watch the anime!!!
"It's not the best rpg you will play but it's not the worst either. It's 
your typical gacha with monthly events and daily quest to keep you occupied 
while you wait for the slot machine to pop out the characters you want 
most. (You may wait a long time, and even longer to promote your favs into 
higher lvl)"
"This story line us so unique and interesting it really lets me see many 
characters in the nasuverse from different angles."
Just play it. For Wailua and huebandos!!!
10/10 would gacha again
Having fun rolling for waifus.
"Slow loading. Can't get past the black screen and after a few restarts it 
is then stuck on a white screen. Please fix. I really want to play this 
game."
"Great game horrible wait time for AP recharge and quests take up way too 
much AP"
"Being a fan of the Fate Series, this game is easily one of the best games 
I've played so far. The animation of all characters are unique and epic, 
and the voice lines are awesome. The storyline is also extremely exciting, 
one example is the Fate/Zero Accel Order event storyline. It uses OSTs from 
the Fate/Zero anime so it gives me a sense of nostalgia, making me want to 
rewatch it again. The storyline also got me at the edge of my seat (Yeah 
that's just how good this game is!) Not only that, the Customer Support 
deserves to be praised. I experienced a small issue and emailed them and 
they replied to me really fast, double thumbs up! All in all, man this game 
is just too good to be true, definitely recommended!! (Btw the only thing 
the devs must work on is the 5 Star Servant drop rates... Seriously, the 
drop rate is so low that u could only probably get 1 5-Star Servant after 
about 1000 summons I guess)"
"Best game, along with Gbf. Hands down"
"You kept your promise and fixed the connection, good job guys"
"Seems to be a bug that won't let you get past the start of the game you 
just get stuck on a black screen forever. Close out and restart only to be 
stuck on a white screen after the title screen. Looks like this is a known 
issue yet no fix has been made. Doesn't give me much hope for the game 
itself."
"Unistalling. Downloaded it the other night before the update. Made it to 
the first mission when the update hit then ever since that after the title 
screen goes White it never loads up so I actually never got to even play. 
Very disappointed."
"I was disappoint when I wasn't able to get through the second cutscene. I 
tried everything to make it work but my efforts were in vain. It shocked me 
a bit because I have the Samsung s8. Please help fix this problem. I would 
have really liked to play this game."
I love this. So many waifus so little time!
haha boobies
Finally
Loved this game but can't login since update.
"No SSR still, send help"
"This is quite honestly the only bloody game where you can dump 40 or more 
dollars into a summon style gimmick and get nothing useful. I've played 
since this games release and I still haven't gotten a 5 star hero despite 
multiple attempts at ""boosted rate"" draws. Call it bad luck or rigged 
rates, it doesn't matter, either way I'm done with this game, every useless 
5 star craft essence I see makes me hate this game more knowing that it 
could've been a hero, any 6 of them could have been a hero instead and I 
would've at least been satisfied having a single top tier character. But 
it's been many months and a lot of regret so I must say goodbye fgo, 
hopefully others enjoy you more than I have. Suggestions I have are maybe 
allowing for guaranteed 4 star servants with 30 quartz draws, decreasing 
drop rates for CE's, improve your dollar to quartz conversion rates, but 
whether or not you listen is irrelevant since no one will likely read this 
or even consider it because it will decrease profits."
"1 star overall only due to the sheer fact that you introduced a game 
breaking bug and have not acknowledged it and attempted to fix it. I am 
referring to the fact many players myself included cannot get past the 
whites screen or prologue cutscene"
"Great game, Constantly updated with minimal issues. Follows the jp schedule 
so can expect content for a long time. Most content is able to be cleared 
with free units."
"This is a mobile game done right. No shady MTX, no stupid caps, devs have 
lots of events and give away tons of free items and characters."
"Just started the game and I loved it but it froze on me and when i 
restarted the game, it doesn't go passed the white screen"
Its a great game when it works
I'm in love this game is amazing
"It is assume especially the French jokes and WWII joke at the beginning of 
the 100 years war secushun."
6/5!!!
"It is a good game but I keep on getting 4 star Craft essences and not 
heroes during summonings. It is kinda disappointing."
"I really like the game. The only thing I hate or dislike about the game is 
the summing for 5 star servants."
Highly addictive and quite fun
"I wish i can rate the gatcha rate up.... I am quite salty for the longest 
of time about it xD but awesome game!!! I got my hubby Gilgamesh! 5 stars 
for that!"
"Favorite gatcha game so far. I am biased tho because I love the Fate 
series. If you enjoyed watching any of the Fate series I'd highly recommend 
this game."
"Fun. Addictive. Pretty nice story. Waifus everywhere. Just play already. 
Won't have free time if you do."
"I love this game, i never get tired of playing this"
"Catching waifus has never been more fun. And managing your quartz has never 
been more stressful. Tis a good game Àä‚ñΩÀã"
"It's good in all sides but I still havent won any 5 star servants in summon 
and that pisses me off üòÇüòÇ 10/10 üòç"
Huh.... where did all my time go?
La Resistance
"A great RPG game with good strategy gameplay style. The only thing really 
irritated me is the SSR and even SR drop rate is too low compares to other 
gacha games. But we can build our 1-3 stars to make up for it, so it's 
quite ok. The leveling and raising skill take LOT of effort and time and 
ingame money, so prepare yourself."
Take my money and give me my waifu
Its way better than most mobile games
"One of the best mobile games I have ever played, but requires luck when 
rolling for high tier servants."
"First of all i really like the game until it need to update and its really 
disappointed you know what i start erasing some app for this and nothing 
happens it keeps in requesting need more space and now i try to uninstall 
it even i dont want to ..such a waste of time keeping this app if you can 
minimize the amount of mb needed i think this app can be awesome"
"It's fun, has a surprisingly interesting story for a gatcha, and has a good 
deal more strategy than your average mobile game. It does, however, crash 
occasionally on my device (a relatively new ""Viking Pro"" Android tablet). 
Tech Support/Customer Service is excellent, restoring my brother's account, 
which had been lost through some mishap with his phone, in less than 24 
hours. Rolling gacha frequently is not required, and any purchases you will 
be making are all but guaranteed to be because you want a particular 
character, and not to increase your team's power, as time and dedication 
rather than gacha collection, is necessary to level up your characters. 
That being said, the Support and in-game friend system can be used, making 
the game playable without any grinding whatsoever. Overall, I highly 
recommend Fate/Grand Order to anyone already familiar with the series, even 
if they would not like the self-insert fantasy wish fulfillment one tends 
to expect from these sorts of games. Though it is very true that some of 
the characters would benefit from wearing more clothes, even the 
protagonist is a unique character, and the story fits well into the overall 
franchise. Despite the occasional bout of tedium from battling waves of 
anemones, this is overall an excellent game and definitely worth a download."
To indulge on getting and spending time with your waifu and husbando
"Separate the craft summon and hero summon. Much better chances to get 
either way ehen separate summoning."
Fav game from fav anime
"Great story and gameplay. Some low stars servant can be called hidden sr 
and ssr. Very grindy but no need to get a team full of ssr to clear the 
content, just use strategies and borrow friend's support to clear it."
Very Good!!
Its a good game.
Ruined my life. 5 stars.
"Overall 5*. The probability of getting SSR might be low but using low 
rarities servants makes me appreciate each character more. The story is 
great but miss some JP humor when localized to NA."
"The story is awesome with great game mechanics and leveling system. It's 
fun to play!"
Wonderful game with wonderful graphics.
"I love how the storyline keeps you going. And the graphics are gorgeous üòä 
Great game!"
Enjoying game and addictive.
Amazing game and really enjoyable
Well if you're fate/typemoon fan sure you like it
"Amazing gameplay, graphics and system. I don't know what to say that all 
but Exellent!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
"Everything is great,however the summon rate are quite low in view of new 
player not able to complete some quest with only 1 or 2 4* servants. Also 
why is asia purchase less crystal (SGD119.98 @ 140 crystal and JP @167 
crystal). Make me wonder they, will maker return us the different."
"An awesome game to play as I've spent well over a hundred hours in. The 
story can be either be humorous or gripping at any moment but the tone is 
always on point whenever the story gets tense as man times the stakes get 
real as you fight for the future of all mankind. I would recommend everyone 
to play this game as it is a gripping tale filled with ups and downs, 
victories and defeats, and most important of all this game will suck you in 
a way that will change you forever. So overall five out of flipping five."
"Both the game and its communities are sooooo good! So good that I cud not 
leave this game after burning month quartz in jalter and got attila np2"
"Great game,great experience,good graphics,good story and awesome gameplay."
WAIFU WAIFU WAIFU everywhere üòÇ
I give you 5 star where are my SSR

"Fun game, the gacha makes me wanna die"
"Unable to get into the game. I have a Samsung galaxy S7 active. Is it 
unavailable to play on this phone?"
"Fate Grand Order. Summoning Heroic Spirits of the past to save all of 
humanity, and deal with never ending shenanigans. This game has story and 
heart much like a visual novel, only with the added kick of being able to 
build your own team of heroes(?) to save the world. You can easily feel 
each character that you aquire as you use them, being far more than random 
cookie-cutter 'heroes' from other games that have little more than a 
sentance to explain them. The game itself has pleanty of heroes that can be 
aquired, but while the 5* servants are the best in overall ability, you 
don't actually need the strongest to survive or get through the story (they 
just make it easier). That and your 'friend' list will no doubt have some 
spirit that will more than make up for heroes you dont have. You play 
smart, and even 'weak' servants can be strengthened to fight at the end 
game. Even if you have never heard of Fate before now, you can easily get 
into this game without knowing anything, and you can still follow along 
easily. Its a good game and I recommend it."
Gacha is cruel
Its a good game but the grind is hard
Its a fun game i think?
"Worst game I've ever played. Scout rate is terrible and my account got 
jacked 3 days after I lucked out with my first 5 star. Not to mention it 
takes too damn long to farm quartz. You also burn through so much energy 
just get 1 quartz. In my opinion this game is not efficient and not worth 
your time wait for something better to come out."
Amazing game I must say
I love playing this game an I was wondering when will it work for chromebook
Awsome game for moblie
"The best RPG game I ve played and this continues the story of Fate Grand 
Order Movie"
The Game is good The noble phantams is asome
"Been waiting for this game to come out in English ever since I played the 
Japanese version cause I mostly just run in circles in the Japanese version 
with only the image to show me what buffs does the skill give to my 
servants, seeing the Buster, Arts and Quick in the Craft Essence to tell me 
what it does. Now with those restrictions out of the way I can play FGO 
without confusion :3 but I still play the Japanese version cause I really 
don't want a repeat of me losing my Jap account. Still have E-Rank luck in 
gacha though haha!"
"Good game addictive I cant stop playing but when will sixth singularity get 
released I want Camelot released to continue playing"
"Best mobile game I ever played. I love the story, artwork, and gameplay. I 
love this game so much and is the only one that I consistently play daily."
"Loved the game at first after getting new phone transfer code didn't work 
and even with screen shots and mutiple emails they did nothing to help lost 
lots of money and a account...."
"Customer service decline my account transfer , stating that I breach of 
agreement on 3rd party service ?? Who else have this problem"
"I've always love the Fate Series. But suddenly I can't open the app. It 
said I should check my internet connection but my connection is great. I 
can play other online games but I can't login to this game anymore. Can you 
please try and fix it???"
not support nokia8 (2017)
"I really love this game but,,, HELP!! I can't access the Game since the 
last update T-T. I have strong WIFI and Data connection but still keeps on 
saying can't connect or should restart the game.. Developer-san Helpuu 
TT-TT. What should I do??"
"Fun, addicting, quick, turn based combat system."
Im a simple man. I see FGO. I click. And cry for my wallet.
"What's the point of having login streak if your going to revert it back to 
1 every 7 days plus rewards will be much worse after that. There is no 
other way of obtaining 5* characters other than draw, you can choose to 
level up other heroes but they will remain at that raruty, no way to obtain 
higher stars for them. If you're prepared to pay to get the good heroes 
then play"
"Pretty much best fate mobile game you can ever find out there. Totally 
recommend this to any fate series fan!"
Yo
Finally Eng Ver.
"I love that you can get the original charters from the anime and the story 
is grate thankes for a grate game I don't think I will be uninstalling this 
game ever."
Doesn't. Even work. On my tablet wont load or anything
"Liked it very much, very entertaining, great meme and waifu material"
Before i play this game how much memory will this cost? Or how many MB
Black Keys for everyone!! ;D
"I've played this game before but I downloaded it again and every time I try 
loading it up it says connection lost retry plz let me know how to fix the 
problem"
"First I just want to say that this game is awesome! I love playing it and 
there are events regularly. Unfortunately the summoning is horrendous 
because the rate for the better servants is ridiculously low. That is the 
only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars."
"I love this game.. But the Gacha Rate is like Devil's Incarnate wth?! .. 
120 saint quartz no SSR !"
"I've been having issues with this game. I can't even open it, it won't let 
me for some reason. It used to work but now I can't"
"The game has attractive visuals during gameplay, however, the art for 
character cards (or even character pertaining to the story) are 
inconsistent and some outright look bad. The Gameplay is solid and does the 
basic level to keep interest but eventually it grows stale after so long. 
Feeling as though each experience of the Gameplay is the same, no matter 
which enemy you face. The currency for summoning could also use some work. 
While I understand that they are a business and do need to make profits, I 
feel as though they have incorporated a currency that takes weeks to get 
the required amount to summon 11 characters, and it feels more like a chore 
rather than a system of progression. It's rather easy to get the currency, 
but if you want to learn about the story, it takes much longer than it 
should. Since you have to beat 5+ missions (further into the game) to just 
get one of them, it becomes a hassle and is unfulfilling. Add in the time 
it takes to read everything, which can drone on endlessly, to fill in time 
to make the game feel longer. Skipping the story shortens the time it takes 
significantly, though it's not good if you're more encouraged by the game 
to skip it's own story. Which is what the game implies when interactions 
between characters can take up to 10 minutes to read and barely any 
progression in the story or character development occurs. Lastly, I am 
disappointed with how they incorporated dialogue options in the story. None 
of the options you choose really make a difference in dialogue and are 
typically answered with vague responses that could easily answer either 
dialogue you chose. Instead of feeling like I'm connecting with the 
characters by choosing unique options to communicate with them, it all ends 
up being pre-determined and detracts from that personalization. You could 
remove the options and nothing about the story or interactions between 
characters would change. I love the Fate Series with all my being, and I 
love a lot of aspects of this game. There is alot of amazing artistic 
pieces in here as well as gameplay that manages to keep interest. These 
were some faults that I had with the game and hope can be improved upon."
I give this 4 star because I only have 4 star servant
"Very dull grinding 35% loading 60% fun play time 5%. I love the anime. But 
this game is just terrible. The gameplay and story is repetitive and 
boring. Levelling up is a huge grind with no rewarding experience. Its 90% 
too easy with occasional impossible levels that force you to be too op to 
have a challenging experience. Animation is really poor quality, especially 
story mode cut scenes. Game runs poorly. Constantly freezing my device. 
Which makes no sense as its got so little content. I think the makers faild 
on everything."
"I CANT PLAY IT it say I can't play in my environment when I live in the 
United States"
Jalter made me broke
The king of gacha games. Great story
"Great, an excellent game with tons of content"
It it so fun just wish the rates were better
Good game...Keep up the good work
"I live the game but I feel like saber is to hard to get I've opened God 
knows how many summons but I don't have her I cry"
Very great game. Fun mechanics
"Can you fix this :( i cant play it on flare 2x but on my other phones it 
works but on this flare x2 why cant i play it on this phone ?"
"Great gameplay&storyline that keeps getting better if you like the fate 
series you'll love it. I hope there's even more to come"
I wish it wouldn't log me out every three battles.
"Another Gacha game, it has nothing new to keep me playing it."
Pikachu you are doing great day
This game so great I wish I will get my Waifu here soon.
10/10 waifus and husbandos.
"The game rocks. I wish buying quartz didn't cost so much and it didn't take 
to whaling to get cool servants, but its still a great game."
"Waifu sim the only time you need to spend money to a five star us when it's 
your waifu because in this game 3 stars are just as good as 4 or even 5 
stars"
Looks like a good game
Really impressive mobile rpg that captures the essence of the fate series.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO CU CHULAINN. WHY IS NO ONE ELSE UPSET ABOUT THIS
"Love this game been playing when it finally came to na just lost my account 
hoping I can get it back but I hope one day they can put a bind to your 
email or something later in the future"
Love this game alot been playing when it came to na
"Good gameplay and story, but had to mark it way down for the gacha 
greediness. I've spent money on mobile games before, but if you're not 
willing to whale for this one, don't bother spending a single dollar. Pulls 
are expensive, 10-pulls don't even guarantee a 4* hero, and 5* heroes have 
a 1% drop rate. This is all because they put equipment in the same draw 
pool as the heroes, which is super frustrating. In my opinion, the game is 
worth playing for free, but not getting invested in. People spend literally 
hundreds of dollars to get one hero they want during their banner event, 
and still don't have any guarantee. Really kills motivation to play past 
the story."
Best app to test your brain and strategys during combat or just in general.
"I really really love this game!!!but i gave 4 star because there are no pvp 
battles,plz!!add some pvp battles and friendly match with friends ty"
Finally i've been waiting this game for a long time
Freaking amazing.
Game's good... Nuff said
NEEDS MORE DISCOUNTS ON QUARTZ. seriously ever heard of a sale?
Once their was an ugly barnacle....he was sooo ugly that everyone died
Not playable on galaxy note 5
"Just an amazing turn-based action game. Would recommend to anyone who'd 
looking for an rpg with a fun and exhilarating experience with a cool 
fanbase surprisingly."
Its repetitive
Cant play. Dont know why.
"This game is boring and lazy. Straight up boring and lazy, I do not 
recommend as there is a lot more hero games worth your time than this lazy 
game. Only thing great about this game is the free currency they give you 
everyday and at the end of quests for boring yourself out on this game."
"One of the best gatcha games I've seen. All of the characters are 
semi-randomized in the draw, and I am happy to say with friends, all the 
quests are easier. The only way I would like to change it is with a PvP 
mode."
Finally it's available for the land down unda
"If there were English audio as an option, it would be perfect. This game is 
everything you love about the Fate franchise and more."
It's really fun to play the game
This game is awesome!!
"Everything are almost perfect. But the thing is now I cant open the app. It 
crashes everytime I try to open it. Can somebody please fix this."
"They won't let me play. Saying my device is rooted or something but I did 
fix it already. They're so greedy :( scared that I would cheat on the game"
"PLEASE RELEASE A GLOBAL VERSION OF THIS GAME I REPEAT RELEASE FULL GLOBAL 
VERSION FOR THIS GAME I BEGGING YOU DEV PLEASE RELEASE FULL VERSION OF THIS 
GAME FOR GLOBAL PLAYER!!!"
"Love it very addicting anime game and great storyline and they have event 
so its not boring to wait for main story. And i have no problem about the 
gacha rates cause to me it feels like the more you gacha the more you can 
get better gachas just played it in 53days and already got two 
5*servants(Waver, Vlad III) i have no problem grinding but the AP 
expenditure is high 40AP just to get 4*exp cards but still give it 5stars"
Its gay
"First mobile game I spent money on. Love the game even when the rolls don't 
go my way. Keep up the good work."
"Love the game, i wish it some short anime video."
Great TV show glad this game was made.
"Awesome release. Good game and great for those who are fans of the Fate 
series. The Gacha in Fate GO as expected have really low chance for 5* and 
you are lucky to get even a 4* servant. But even so there are some decent 
3* servant whom are some familiar faces for those who watch the anime. Good 
game overall but it will take time to grind and patience. The story is 
excellent so far and have made me hook me more on the game. Stay for the 
story and wait for future events. Also it need a Google save or Facebook 
save."
"I would've given this game 5 stars, if only there was a way to link your 
account... my data just got wiped out & I didn't know you hafta copy a code 
or somethin just to restore it. I assumed it was linked to google like most 
of the mobile games but noooo... Now I'm back to zero. Thanks a lot for 
wastin mah money, time & effort. >:/"
I love the gacha salt
Lost data simple
Good game i love the fsn series
Great game for all those Fate fans
10/10 reinstalling the game for story
"The only problem to this game is this, it will make you feel really salty."
"With my only issue being that I lost all my data for this game when I 
switched phones, this game is a major time sink. In a good way."
"Everytime I open the app.. downloading screen appear.. from 1%to 100% (I 
already downloaded the file).. and if you turn on and off the data.,the 
percent is boosted from 1% to 45% and do it again to reach 100% but it wont 
open the title screen..edit: I just fix the issue.. im enjoying the game 
right now"
"Day 273: I tried pressing the 10 summon button for the 116th time. Still no 
five star in sight. My siblings both have gotten more than one five star at 
this point. I fear I will have to resort to buying Saint Quartz"
"pls help i have an s6 edge device and the game app wont open for me. really 
would love to play this game..."
"Great game, even though the gacha is hell still a game i can enjoy"
Be warned: this is hell you're walking into.
I cried when mash sacrfices her life
Cannot play
"I've been playing for a week and so far I really love everything about the 
game, especially the main story and the current event story *goosebumps*. I 
only have one concern, to be honest. Is there anyway to save our progress 
or bind our accounts somewhere to keep them safe if ever something happens 
to the device I'm playing it on? I don't really wanna lose my progress with 
the story here, and of course my heroes. Hope somebody can answer this for 
me, thanks."
"Don't understand why my FGO is not working...it always brings me to 
gmail/email -_-"
It is very addicting..... I really love the game...
Waifus are so good
TOTALLY AWESOME üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
"Well I thoroughly enjoyed this game, but my phone unexpectedly died on me 
and I had to get a new one. Lost all my units and upgrades."
Goodgame
"Anyone who likes Fate/Stay Night or Zero or any of the shows will like 
this. And newcomers will like it too."
Fun.. Love this game.
It was greatly
"If you want to ever get good in the game real money is required even then 
rng is pretty bad so there is no guarantee of getting whar you want. You 
can grind for a whole month and not get what you want. GACHA at its most 
toxic"
"The game is a pretty fun thing to play. The story and gameplay segregation 
could be more immersive so that it doesn't feel like in the main missions 
you have only one permanent servant but that would be quite time consuming 
to make. FYI Until one reaches a certain point it can be rather difficult 
or impractical to fully exploit the various events as you lack enough high 
level servants. Also, beware of gacha rolls. You have better luck in real 
life casinos. Seriously, one roll I got three stupid craft essence watches 
in a row. My current trend is that I keep getting potions. Later as you 
level up you tend to be able to play less due to action points. But the 
game IS fun."
Great story but the gactha still depressing
"Been playing the JP version now that its released in my region, my wallet 
will be running dry."
"I have spent nearly $1500 trying to get one servant, but I never get them"
niice game
"Surprisingly demanding of your device considering it is processing a visual 
novel+standard gatcha game combat system. This lag makes the game a chore, 
which is a shame because this game does the standard stuff well and 
sometimes that is all you need."
"Coming back from the JP version to learn the story, I was not disappointed. 
Looking forward to it catching up to where I left off."
game crashes can't even load the game
"In all honesty I find it hard to believe that getting 5* characters is this 
games biggest appeal. But it is... You're better off hiring somebody to 
reroll on a banner you like then giving this game money on characters with 
fake rate ups. Honestly the game is beautiful and is okay in terms of fun 
but the work put into doesn't pay off when it comes to summoning. And I'm 
not alone on this. Look at YouTube and see for yourself the frustration and 
money spent just to get someone new. It's sad when you see a game with this 
sort of fan base and love get robbed because they want to make a few extra 
bucks. The money made, for sure doesn't go into content but these cash grab 
characters. Truly when content is based on characters in banners we are in 
trouble."
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Even tho it steals my wallet, no game can compare to 
Fate/GO. I only rarely see any bugs around this game with is great. The 
only problem is, it consumes too much space. So, fix that Aniplex (PS: 
Finally, after years of waiting, it's available in the Philippines. Don't 
need APK anymore)"
"It's a great, king Arthur's a cute anime chick, what's not to love?"
Impressive
"I have loved this game for as long as I can remember. Nice to see it 
released here now. You guys need to add on your page. If you have USB debug 
on, the game won't run. I do my own app development so I have it on and it 
took me months to figure out it was that causing it. Lost my game progress 
too."
"Excellent story and characters and an elegant gameplay system let down only 
by a painful gatcha system. You may not need the 5* Servants to do well, 
but they are the most popular for a reason. Translation sometimes 
questionable but it has improved since the start"
"So addicting and fun but need to have a better way of getting quartz and 
servants"
I rate this game the stars it loves to give me.
"Now i finally see what the hype is all about, fantastic game"
"I played and uninstalled it for a moment and then I installed it again but 
I started from the beggining and my save is not there I guess"
Come and join us in hell ‚ù§
A fun experience
"I thought the game would be make us summon 1 character per person and we 
fight with other people servant to win the grail, i thought the game play 
more like toram"
Trash cash grab
"Good game, just hope players can have more interact to each others"
"A fun game that is insanely easy to sink a lot of time in, especially early 
on when you level up every couple of missions for easy AP, the gameplay is 
fun for a card based combat game, the story is amazing, and the sheer 
number of potential Servants, all with their own unique personalities based 
on their legacy, makes collecting them an adventure in itself, my only real 
complaint is how tedious and tiring it can be to raise your Servant's 
strength, as farming for Embers of Wisdom can derail progress elsewhere"
"Eyy, man if you ever felt lonely you can just pop this app and booom, 
entertainment at it's finest"
This is GACHA HELL!
"why can't Bandai Namco port Xenogears, Xenosaga, and Baiten Kaitos games 
over to switch?! also Finch merch plz thank you"
"I really love this game. From the graphics to the character designs and 
quests, the only problem I have is with me using up my Saint Quartz a lot xD"
"Played a year, over 100 gacha, only 3 4-stars undesired cards. If you're 
not lucky enough to draw a 5 star, this game is not for you, there're 
events but you cannot win anyway"
"Ok this is why i gave 3 stars like 80 percent of all anime games i played 
all of them are full of girls pls add like alot of boys so i can give you 5 
stars"
"Love the game and the stories, higher rate up for 5 star servants though 
please qwq 1 percent is just cruel DX"
If you arr a fan of fate franchise. This is a must play game for you
Love the game but it keeps kicking me of
"I was excited to play, but it's pretty boring and slow and the story is 
long winded and pointless at the same time. Also, weird that your heroes 
don't level from fighting, you have to pump items into them."
"Uninstalled this game because I can't play this game unless I keep 
""developer options"" turned off. I use usb tethering from phone to my laptop 
to share my phone's internet connection. This game constantly monitors to 
see if ""developer options"" is on and if it is, it tries to send an email to 
support (even when I'm not trying to play the game and sometimes even when 
I close the game, it will do the same thing) This just got too annoying and 
I had to uninstall. I really wish I could play this game, but I don't think 
it's reasonable for a game to tell me what I can do on my phone when I'm 
not playing the game."
"Free to play if you never want to get anything useful. Boring gameplay 
that's been done a million times. If I could just get it as a VN then it 
would be worth it. The dev's must love the horny nerds throwing hundreds of 
dollars for a 5% or less chance at getting the card they dream of"
I Love This Game
Is this game online?
Cannot play on note 8
"I've always wanted to get into the Fate series, so I guess this is my 
gateway. It's highly addictive. Just don't let the gacha consume you!"
"A great game for strategy focused players. It really mixes in a good card 
management system, bring me some nostalgia from kingdom of hearts. The 
story is also somewhat entertaining as expected from an anime based game. 
It's not quite the best game for people who aren't used to the whole 
gachapon system though, that aside it's a well made game to pass your time 
with. As for the servants try not to set your eyes on one servant cuz the 
gatchapon will burn your spirit if so, try to look for either a good 
servant as stated in some website (GameA) orgo and have fun with the 
servant that looks good to you. A tip though if your serious about the 
game, there is a reroll function in the game, try and get heracles 
(berserker) in your free spin he will be a huge asset for you in the game 
especially in earlier levels."
NOT WORKING CLOSES SECOND OF OPENING
Not working.
Is not working... why this game is #1 top?? Loser

The lore is awesome too since it was written by Nasu-sama."
I'll give you a 5 star review.  Now give me a 5 star servant.......
"Tbh I really, REALLY love the game!!!!!! I am rarely seeing any bugs 
whether it's minor or major thanks to your maintenance team really 
appreciate it guys. I hope that this game becomes a full fledge anime and 
not just an OVA, to give the series a ""GRAND"" finale and the series is 
just........ wow, it made me cry and made me understand a lot of things in 
life and more, so overall love the game, love the series, hope that this 
will be a full fledge anime in the future in honor of the series that has 
been my favorite since when I started watching as a kid. So God Bless you 
guys and keep up the good work.üòÄüòÅ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§!!!!!!!!!!!"

"GREAT STORY! üòç It's like I'm the protagonist of my own Holy Grail Warüòç 
and I'm in nostalgia every time I summon a servant from Zero, Stay Night:

I am a fan of fate and knowing this game made me excite!‚ô°
An amazing game.
It's dumb
You need to make the game in 18.9 aspect ratio
Download stuck at 1% for an hour and my internet has nothing to do with it.
"Loading takes forever. Whenever im gonna do something, it will load for 
like 30 seconds. Especially for the 10x summon. I can fall asleep waiting 
for like 10 mins just for the whole summoning. Every fight needs loading 
ang loading and loading. I got bored and im uninstalling."
Dabest
"Common but great gameplay. Great storyline. Awesome artworks. Really 
addictive."
"Where is the saint quartz reward after tutorial? How do you expect new 
joiners from other regions to catch up?"
"I'm a fan of anime and historical /epic characters of the world, and this 
game got it all. Love this game"
"It's not playable in Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I want to play this game so 
badly but it redirects to Gmail for sending a notice for error. Hoping the 
updates could fix this. Till then I will uninstall this since I couldn't 
play it at all."
"I still cant get a five star in game so pls give me 5 star for giving u 5 
stars"

Really good time waster
Its a very astonishing and amazing Game.. 10000000/10 stars
"When saber uses excalibur on the training golem the screen turns to white i 
waited for an hour and it still wouldn't work"
"It's a great game just hate the chances of getting favorite servants and 
the fact some are only available for a limited time and the drop rate of 
acension items are stupid low"
I love it but it mess up some times
Loading is very slow
"Kinda wish there was pvp, or I would rate 5 stars"
"Pls allow this game to be played on all devices... i was able to download 
it on my chromebook samsung but wasn't able to open the game. it lead me to 
a my gmail and forced me to send a email... pls allow us chrome users to 
play the game T_T"
Like the game is very well done
"I cant play it with tablet, it has 2gb ram and can play high quality 
graphic games so it's weird that it cant play this, when I launch the game, 
it will go to gmail and send a message to your email saying ""FGo is not 
playable under your playing environment"""
Best game I've played
White screen in the battle tutorial.....
"Strongly recommend this game. For smoothly play. 3 gbs ram at least 
recommended"
Everything is good except for it's 5 star drop rate
Cant play game i sent u the error code pls fix
"Le me? Just looking for a good game then suddenly i saw this one and then 
view it at youtube then wow got hook up! Thank glad there's an english

want a Fate/Zero game too. Cuz this game was amazing!Love It!!!!!!"
Usss
"Can you fix this? I can't play this game.. Error always and I sent you 
gmail to fix this but didn't do anything at all"
A fan of Fate. Nothing more to say.
"Hopes it picks up fast and everything the Japanese release has soon 
including events!!"
"Excellent all around game. I'm an avid fan of the Fate Stay and Fate Zero, 
it was a wonderful surprise to see the game is an individual story within 
the series and not a cheap ripoff. Even better that it is ad free. If I 
would request anything, it would be a way to buy Saint Quartz with leftover 
QP. I have a ton of QP just laying around would love to do something with."
"I don't like this game. Why ? You no random free character 5 Star in first 
gacha boo bad. Graphic ok"
"I love the game but it's really sad I have to start over please make 
another kind of account saving system since the deletion of my acc wasn't 
really intended and now I can't get it back because I didn't save the code"
Its verry exciting
God-made creation.......

"I'm a real fan of fate and i really love it, keep up the Good work guys"

Addicting and fun to play
"Great game. You just need to have patience and a lot of understanding for 
the gacha rolls, as getting your fave servants requires a ton of luck as 
well as cash. Love the game and the game will love you"
"The game is perfect good gameplay but the only problem why T.T don't have 
save options like linking with face or Google is a lose my phone or broke 
:) I love this game I play it everyday never get 5 star xD but I love it"
"Good game, very addictive, easy to control, recommend for who search for 
turn based rpg game"
Really fun game wish there were more like it.

So incredibly addictive.
"I was really hoping to play this game but it decided to open my gmail 
instead and say that I can't play in my environment. Pls fix this! I really

Sucks doesn't run in Android Samsung s7 really

My gooodness don't you guys kbow how long have i waited for thiss
"Love the game. My only complaint is my game keeps crashing, but only on a 
few occasions. Other than that it's great"
"I kinda dislike the anime cause I can't really follow the story line but I 
hope this change my viewing perspective."
I am waiting this game for a long time. :))
AMAZING!!
Nice Game Rarely See Games Like This...
doesnt work on oneplus5t
"Sent you an email. Unable to play it from my Note8. Will only change the 
rating once I'm able to play the game within 48-hours."
"I loved it ,thank you so much"
"Finally, I found the English version of this game!!! Thank you developer."
"Not bad but not my kinda of rpg to me, the story is quite confusing and not 
that interesting btw. Card battle commands are easy to me. Graphics is 
pretty good. 3 stars to me as not to my liking but good effort on making 
this gameüòé"
"Hey, not working for some phones. Kindly check on why this is happening. 
Sadly, I've waited for the english version, and to find that this ain't 
working, just makes me sad. I'll wait for thr fixes."
Nice finally a worthy game to invest time üòé
Doesn't work on Moto G3.
"Good Game, Great Story, Perfect Waifus"
Finally released in australia
"I try to open the game but it directs me to ""send through"" some app? How do 
i get this game to work?"
Get this game right now#!!!
tfw ssr rate drop are 1% :'(
"Can't even play. Whenever I press the app, it just keep going to share, 
instead of starting the game. Boo!"
"Pretty good game, hard work that feels worth(yeah, kinda grind-y). No 
matter what people say about gacha, in this game... YOU DO NOT NEED to 
summon, in fact 1* characters or 2 star characters are good enough to 
finish the entire GAME. Just grail and you're set. The summons are just for 
pleasure for waifus and husbandos IMO xD (Although some servants are pretty 
dang good.) Really enjoying the game."
"Why can't i play it? I really can't understand why it is not playable in my 
enviorment."
"1) I've met all the system requirements -Failed to start 2) I've tried 
other games with higher system requirements -worked fine 3) I've installed 
this game before (jap version) -worked fine SO WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING THIS 
TIM??"
Its great now it kinda makes sense how the fgo is good
"The best game I have ever played, the gameplay, the story and (of course) 
the adorable and cool heroes! Thank you for your good work!"
Finally!! !
yesss
Can't play
Poor devices support
Customer Service was very good of resolving my problem of the app
Ilove it so much
"great game, perfect story, lovely characters, 10/10"
Crashed on startup - error code 60.
"""Sono saki wa jigoku dazo"" said by Emiya about FGO gacha"
The best game I have ever played
"I've always loved the Fate Series, and always will <3"
"It would be nice if it works. It keeps on crashing. Just open the app, 
you'll see white screen then crash."
Cool and i love it
Addicting. Absolutely love it
"Im trying to play this game right now, but it keep on crashing a asking me 
to send report .. Are u kidding???"
Finally the english version
Best place to harvest salt
Good game. Finally it's official
"What can I say, I'm an absolute sucker for the Fate series so this 
obviously floats my goat. Honestly, summoning is so shii that I spent quite 
a lot trying to get JAlter (and ultimately not getting her, but got like 3 
other SSRs and levelled up Berserker Tamamo's NP twice), so I still do not 
mind. I have a lot of fun going through the stories, and the events are a 
great plus too"
Is this is offline
"not working some error .force to open gmail to send that can open in 
enviromnet ? lols can fix it.. i waiting for english in a long time and 
this is what you show to me, come on. fix it"
"To those getting an error and automatically opening an email, try searching 
for fate grand order wikia. They have an error table. Fixed my issue at 
least, error 43 being that usb debug is turned on. Turned it off and now my 
game is able to bypass the error and load the game . Thanks to the author 
for that thread argentinekiranomaze i believe was it"
"I have been playing this game since its japan launch.So glad it has finally 
been launched in my country!"
"I love the game and the story but i hate the way the game loads it's to 
slow, i m being bored waiting for the game to loads please fix it, you have 
a great game but the slowness of the game sucks!!!"
"Okay. It runs, but only on Wi-Fi. No Autoplay to help with the grind and 
doesn't run on Mobile Data. I wonder if you really want players to play the 
game at all? Basically a huge Pay To Win App too."
"Absolutely terrible game, no way to take skills off cooldown with Command 
Spells whatsoever. Horribly exploitative gacha meant solely to milk suckers 
out of their money as increasingly irrelevant and unsuitable figures are 
added to pad Nasu's bank account. It'll drain your time, money, and 
happiness and leave you with nothing of value whatsoever. Also you can't 
take skills off cooldown with Command Spells. Just. Evil."
Well this game is amazing. That's all thank you!
"Why i can't play this game in my phone when i open the app it will close 
then the zandesk for fgo email me in my gmail that this game is not 
playable in my environment plsssss fix this error i want to play this game 
im from the philipines"
Wouldn't open for j7 pro
Crashes on start up.
Notice: Crashes on startup on Samsung Galaxy A7 running Android 7
"It's a great in depth game, especially if you are a fan of the series."
good job of making this game never get bored üòÄ
"Finally, it's out on PH!"
"You guys work quickly the game is now playable on my device again thx #fate 
go for life!! 5*s all around"

Not working on asus zoom
I love this
"Honestly, this is the BEST games ever. Been playing for 2 months no 
problem. Although I still have no SSRs..."
"Why does it require an email setup? I can't ignore this step for playing 
game."
"Great game. Many waifus. Except the SSR servant rate is too low to be 
summoned."
I love mashuu
Sumanai
"Finally, the game is officially out for Singapore. Hope you guys give us 
updates the same time as US, or at least not too late."
"Greatest Game Of Fate Series Yet. Hope There's More To Come In This Game. 
And I Hope There Will Be A Free 4Star-5Star Servants Event, Because It's 
Really Hard To Get. The Last Time I Summoned 10 Times And Didn't Even Get A 
4Star Servant Even Though It Says 10x Summon Will Guarantee Players A 
4-5Star Servants. Hope We Get What We Deserved."
I luv fate grand order...and it is so good to play
I love listening to its cute voice acting esp. Nobu's üòçüòç
"Great game! Wished all the Anime I knew had games deveoped by the same 
studio."
This game doesn't run on rooted devices
It is offline or online?
"I'VE been playing Fate Extra on my PSP now its on mobile hell yeah! Nice 
game BTW same voice acting at its best loved it very much!!"
YES FINALLY ITS IN MY COUNTRY
force closed

"It won't work on my phone. 3gb ram Android6.0 it opens file manager and 
sends an error file"
"Honestly, this game has too many design flaws to be fun anymore. I lost 
interest a couple months ago and dropped it and just tried picking it up 
again to see if I'd find it more entertaining now, but it just isn't nearly 
as good as it can be. Quartz takes forever to get in game, and the rolls 
feel incredibly unbalanced (I have a friend who has gotten ever 5* to ever 
come out and another who only gets the same 3 characters on every roll and 
they roll the same amount of quartz). For those of us who get the same 
characters, the game just feels futile. There's no real reward. The UI is 
stupidly clunky to use (have to click the back button a million times to 
get to the world hub and see the news. They also have like given up with QA 
on the newer characters. mebd's posture makes her look broken and 
Iskander's head is always stuck behind the UI so I can't even see the 
character. The game is fun if you like the fate series, but for the rest of 
us it's boring and repetitive"
"nice game, good thing it handles 2gb ram but may i suggest if you could 
link or register this to google account just like the other games? it will 
be more convenient if we want to transfer to other phone , btw first gamer 
here üòä"
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING MY WAIFUS TO VIETNAM
Game does not launch
"Installed game but when i start it up the app keep crashing. I am using 
note 5 and this is the first game that i have problem with."
"Really not sure about the game, because the kept on exiting when launch it, 
and it directed me to send an email about the error code. Could be my Sony 
Xperia XZ Premium couldn't play the game. So 3 star for now."
Can't open the app. It takes me to email to ask for information? Weird
Nothing
"Just got released in Australia and theres no release event making it 
worthless to play id you just started"
To much talking than fighting
Cash grab. Nuff said
This game made me poor. 11/10 would be poor again
"Can't open the app it just opens the email app and i thought im suppose to 
log in using those but no i cant"
"I find the game hard to put down ,it is very injoyable."
Best game !!! Fight me
It crashes on Redmi4X
Not even working. This game is thrash.
Finaly an official eng release
Insta download
Not yet available in my country even tho its on play store lol
"Cannot start game. After downloading, it will ask you to complete an action 
using an email app or paypal"
"Good game, great character, really love this game."
cant even play the game. It always crashes
Fun rpg for any fate fan! Or just anime in general.
Love it. That's all.
"Aside from the massive gatcha salt, it's a great game to play. I find the 
story funny and the core gameplay loop is interesting. I'm 50/50 on the 
events though. Some are great but others feel tiring. All in all I would 
recommend this to people who are into anime."
10/10 ty
Wifu Simulator
Finally going global!
"Cant even start the game. Auto exits and brings me to error 43. Please fix 
this asap"
"Great gameplay, nice characters, very good graphic but better if more drop 
rate up for 5*servants"
"Of all the phone games I've ever played I have never been so addicted to 
one like FGO. I totally recommend this game even if you're just curious 
about the game. Don't worry it's not s Loli hentai game (‡πë‚Ä¢ÃÅ ‚ÇÉ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ‡πë)"
‡πÄ‡∏•‡πà‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏á
"All in all this game got me back into the fate seires with all the 
characters that I've come to know and love, so much nostalgia. It's pretty 
straight forward, the only issue is having to grand over a month to level 
up a few characters. Some are easy to, while others are difficult. But 
still a great game all in all 8/10"
"From what I heard, it is very addictive. I'm going to do a blind 
playthrough without buying anything. Wish me luck."
Loading tome for each bsttle is tooooooooooo looooooooong
Love the game but colab events would be nice
"The game freezes when I try to play recently, don't know why, I can't even 
actually play it now, still like it so four stars for now :/"
"Storyline is great so far and the game play is easy to learn. It would be 
great to have a auto feature enabled for story and daily quests already 
completed."
More ost more ost more ost!
"The game is definitely for fans of fate franchise. The story and the game 
play are just great with lot of tactic. However people who aren't fan of 
fate series might not actually enjoy the game at all as the gacha rate is 
insultingly low, at %1 for an SSR character. So yeah, expect a lot of salt, 
mines of salt or even mountains of salt if you are new to fgo"
"Great game overall. The main stories and gameplay can be boring at the 
first few chapters but everything got better in later chapters, even event 
stories and the lore of each character is well-written. As mid-game, the 
game mechanics become more interesting and challenging. And the selling 
point of this game comparing to many other mobile games is the fact that 
every character can be useful. The gacha rate is definitely bad, but don't 
let those n00bs who gone ""bad game cant even got a golden servant in 
blahblahblah 10-pulls and everything is garbage"" got you (lol did those 
m0ngrels even try??), the main content of this game is absolutely clearable 
with lower rarity units and there is already several youtube channels 
showing bronze/silver clear. As some veteran players said, this game is not 
about getting who you like, it's all about loving who you got."
"Fate/Grand Order is a great game. The controls are easy to understand. The 
graphics are fitting and are always getting small visual tweaks for the 
better every now and then. Gameplay is fun! The story is improving with 
each new chapter. Events happen frequently so players won't be bored when 
there isn't any story to complete. You can be completely f2p and/or play 
casually and still have a lot of fun with the game. It is definitely one of 
the best mobages out there!"
"Fun game, great characters. But it is a gacha game so prepare your wallet."
"Cannot play on my phone because it always crashes I was excited for nothing 
thanks"
I love it! This game is like crack!
"Atlast after waiting for too dem long its here in Philippines, thank"
Love the game Got it at launch Later story Berserkers are the best
Doesnt work just shows loading screen thats it
eyy thats pretty good its finally available in Philippines
Finally available in Singapore!
"Best gim ever. I can get my waifus here, Simple gameplay but addictive, and 
great flat game :v"
"Great ultimates, the game overall gets repeatitive quickly"
Historical chracter designs are the best! Love it!
"An epic game, full of well tuned mechanics, a robust cast, and enjoyable 
content."
BEST GAME 10 OUTTA 10
Bob
Good Game Graphics Controls.
"Dear lord is this addictive. And fun. Just...be prepared for the gacha to 
dissapoiny you. 5-star servants have a 1% DRAW RATE"
"The games characters are all unique and they all have deep lore and 
backgrounds, even the item cards have some flavor/lore text that give them 
another layer of uniqueness. The game continually updates with new events 
and characters and there is great satisfaction in leveling and upgrading 
characters to the max. The art on character and item cards are all also 
diverse, expertly drawn, and all have a unique design and lots of detail by 
the artists that make me want to look at them for hours. This is a paid 
game, it is still entirely possible to play for free but even dropping a 
few dollars for favorite characters has made this gaming experience 
worthwhile, I highly recommend this game."
"The game itself is engaging, but the game client is poor - it won't 
recognize S-pen input unlike any other Android app, and even when you exit 
using the in-game option the client doesn't properly close. Tonight, with 
the servers being down for maintenance, this resulted in the app constantly 
crashing and trying to restart due to losing connection, even though it 
should have stopped running per Android policies to stop background apps 
from continuing to run. This caused my tablet to effectively lock up, as I 
couldn't force close the app due to it constantly bringing up the error log 
mail window."
Pretty damn solid for a mobile game id say
"Can't even play this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. After installing and 
trying to open the app, it automatically sends me to my email with an 
automated message to report that the app doesn't work on my device. I've 
never experienced this with any other mobile game or app."
"I got this game not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised that I 
had put so much time into playing it, in short, this game has everything a 
good game should, and I would probably pay money for this game. The 
drawback is that the game often crashes my phone preventing me from doing 
anything till it cools down, if there was an option to lower quality of the 
game so I could actually play it then this would receive a solid 5 stars 
with no doubt."
"Phone crashed and wiped the app. Company refuses to return my account to 
me. Robbery of a game. Don't waste your cash."
You should add pvp mode
"This game is awesome but if you lose your data your screwed. I accidently 
uninstalled the game after 3 weeks of constant play and now i have to start 
over. There is no way to recover the lost data. Thank gawd i didnt spend 
ant money or i would be screwed times 2."
This is the most addicting mobile game I've ever played in my life. Help me.
Kinda wish drop rates were higher. But over all good app I recommend it.
"The game is incredibly fun, I do have only a few misgivings about it, one I wish that the developers would separate the craft essences and servant pulls from the summoning place, they already have three or four sections for summoning like the regular summoning the special event summoning and the friend point summoning, they could at least take time to separate the craft essences and servants into different summoning categories so it's easier to summon servants, I know that the percentage to summon a four or five star servant is low and I don't mind that but with the craft essences and servants being summoned together makes it practically impossible to summon more then a three star servant (trust me that happens to me every time I try to summon) also I keep getting the same servant over and over again,so I wish that they would make it so you never get the same servant in the same summon, another thing that I would like to change is that they would add an auto battle option, just for when you are farming for exp cards in the daily ember gathering quests, just so the game automatically all chooses the best cards that your current team set up is on the quest you are currently on. But other then those the rest of the game is perfect."
"would be great it was great then they added all the craft essences and noe 
I can't even SUMMON a servant higher then sliver, chance up my arse. 5 star 
guarantees, only if it's a craft essence. I miss the old game."
Might be a decent game... If 98% of it wasn't dialog/cutscenes
Oh my God this game is fu*king amazing!
Highly annoyed the back up instructions are not clear I had to reinstall game because of text being messed up and didn't realize you have to do a data transfer so I lost all the packs and progress I had made
"Great story I just wish the story was completed because i want to know what 
happens next but the next chapter isn't available but besides that it is a 
good game"
I can't even play the game! Something about not being able to use the app because of my playing environment. I get the error message when opening the app and it takes me to a generated email to send to the developers and it KEEPS SPAMMING that email no matter how many times I close it. It's almost like a computer virus! Uninstalled.
"I haven't gotten into the gameplay to much, but the wall I'm hitting is the 
dialogue and response are far from a normal conversation. There is no flow 
just bump after bump. I wish the translator was actually from England or 
America."
There is a very annoying bug in this game that will affect your entire android devide. If developer mode is enabled on your device an infinite loop of emails listing the bug report will pop up on your device and make it almost impossible to open any other apps on your device even disable debuggers mode. Overall do not download if you are an android developer.
Pay-to-play game
"Won't open, no matter what I try"
"I really enjoy this game, my husband got me into it can't stop playing now haha. I don't have a problem with the Gacha because people need to realize we should   give them some money to keep supporting the game without it they have nothing. Favorite Servant Edmond Dantes"
Hate hate hate
This is just another time killer type of game which is fun if you know of the show to understand the story behind the servants. I would have rated this a 5 star but the downside is I have spent real money and if I were to uninstall this game it doesn't save any of my data. So don't spend money on this game just grind if you really want the stronger characters.
"This mobile game has a lot more features than a normal one, and the game follows its own storyline.  It even has a feature where you can rewatch the cutscenes again.  So the game does have many things to explore and check out.  There's still lots of improvement that needs and yet they also address those as well, so it's a game where they also improve for the better."
U should put yo own character to fight
"This game is meant only for whales. The game does not provide any 
reasonable way to accumulate gems (in-game currency) even in the beginning 
of the game. To make matters worse, the drop rates for the good servants 
are less than 1% and the real world cost of buying the gems is absolutely 
ridiculous. ($25 dollars to ALMOST be able to do a ten servant summon) 
There are far better gatcha style games out there. Don't waste time or 
money."
"If you have a gambling/spending problem, don't even consider playing this game for the sake of your wallet."
I didn't make it through the training fight. Turn-based fight games aren't my thing.
"App opens to a blank screen, then crashes. It then asks to be directed to either my PayPal or email. No thank you. Uninstalled."
Eveyrtime I click on the game it sends me to my email aop. Please help and eating will go up
wheres my astolfo/10
Just a whitescreen on my note 5. Wont let me play. Please help me i want to play it
"The story is great. It's a lot of fun. The gameplay is simple and good. I 
really wish that I could keep playing but in order to do so, I'd need to 
spend so much. I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars between ffbe, 
dbz dokkan, and dynasty warriors unleashed and I have to say, this game 
gives you almost nothing to start. I barely have enough to ge5 by. The 
leveling system is a disgrace and the summoning is terrible. The rates are 
very low and the fact that your item and character summons are mixed makes 
a hard system even harder to deal with. The game.makes over a billion 
dollars a year and that enables it to give out close to nothing to help you 
along. It's really sad. I thought other games were bad."
Fails to connect to servers 100% useless app
"As with what everyone else is saying, the pull rates for your favorite characters are next to nothing as they are locked behind a 1%(less imo) pick up rate. You don't ""need"" nice 4-5 star pulls, but all the great characters we know and love are there. So what's th let's point of playing a Fate Gacha game if I will virtually never get them?   Visuals are nice, combat is entertaining for a bit, but if you take Fate from the name this game would plummet."
It's takes a lot of memory back ends up worth it!! Best free game there is and LOVE THIS COMMUNITY!!!! Love you Nasu...
Been a Fate fan for very long time. Unfortunately the only thing that's kept me from playing was the rng for summoning heroes. It's terrible and after spending a lot of money and not getting the heroes that I want I just stopped playing. Unfortunately not much is gonna be done to change the gacha system so if you wanna get into this game be prepared to spend a lot of money doing so.
"The game is ok but customer service sucks,  I requested access to my account because the update some how kicked me out,  I gave all the info I knew,  only thing I didn't know was my transfer code or any of the weird names on my friends list so they denied me. I even wrote them from my gmail that's linked to it"
Thanks for mysterious ways
very fun game
"Won't run. When it finally does start, it needs to download much more information just to play."
"Got bored with the story. 45 min of tutorial, which I didn't finish, had only 3 fights. Not to mention the flashback before you're even out of the tutorial, about something that happened in the tutorial! FMIO!"
It is good game even though I didn't get jalter
"I would love to play this game, but it breaks every time I try to launch it on my Pixel 2"
It's a pretty harsh mobage. Good mechancs and room for strategy but it's a grind fest with a gacha system. All popular servants are locked behind a low drop rate and others are underpowered with a few exceptions
"This app won't open while USB Debugging is enabled on my Galaxy Note 5. I'd rather keep USB Debugging as insurance in case I ever accidentally kill my screen again, so, I'll live without the waifus."
Actually a good game.. Little greedy on summons and gems to get 10 summons though. I am giving a bad review because of the ability to only play on ONE DEVICE. That is weak
Game graphics are too intense causing the game to lag so bad it take 20 seconds between screens making the gameplay boring
The game is REALLY GOOD but it needs better rates and an easier way to get currency for rolling
ÂæàÂ•ΩÁöÑÊ∏∏ÊàèÔºåÊØîÂè∞ÊúçÂºÄÊúçÊó∂ÁöÑÊú∫Âà∂Ë¶ÅÊòéÊô∫
"Drops connection every 2 minutes, long loading and poor optimization. Nearly impossible to get a good start when you need to spend ridiculously large amounts of money to feel like you're getting anywhere. Nothing to keep you wanting to play after the first 5 minutes."
"Installed, game crashes and then wants me to open my gmail account? No thanks. Uninstalled."
A great game for fate series fan
"Game is fantastic gameplay wise and graphics are amazing, the problem is that the lag is really bad if you don't have an amazing phone. Like the game needs a serious optimization because it really is obnoxious. Another thing...they are VERY clingy to there in-game currency, after the campaign, you are gonna have an horrible time summoning new servents. And if that wasn't bad enough the drop rate for high level servents are DRASTICALLY LOW, so not only is it hard as hell to get the currency to summon servents, but you have to be incredibly lucky to get the good ones. Overall the game is amazing and very unique honestly, but with the lag and the impossible to get servants. I'm just gonna have to put this game on hold and come back to it."
"Awesome story and gameplay. Totally free to play. Why? Because all characters, even the free ones, were designed to be useful. Huge bonus if you like Typemoon universe and Fate. Be warned, the size of the game might be too big for some. However, if you want a certain servant that's 4 star above, give up because you won't get it. The gacha rate is really horrible and expensive, you'll see a lot of people saying 3 stars below is perfectly doable, which is true, however, the most aesthetically pleasing characters are high rarity all the time."
"Excellent game very fun, the story is interesting anyway a realky fun game, however some of the characters i think some of the servants stars doesn't fit their legend like siegfried a famous dragon slayer a strong character in the anime but in the game he's only a 4 star character so i think the stars for the characters should be revised or something"
It's better than angry birds
Does not launch on Pixel XL running latest Android.
Yay!
My biggest complaint is the gacha rates. They are already extremely low and on top of that the character and essence cards are bunched into a single gacha drastically decreasing the probability of you getting the cards you want.
"Game refuses to run on rooted devices, apparently. F' off; you don't get to decide what I'm allowed to do with *my* tablet."
"It is a great game, but it keeps crashing, Aniplex please fix this problem"
Has the worst login rewards. Plus I think they should separate essence from the summoning that way so I can actually summon a servant. Yes I didn't even get a 3 star servant like it says.
Great game all around
"Great game and graphics. The story is really well done and the characters 
are amazing....really addicting"
"I love the story especially for Solomon  and Babylon which are coming on December of this year and cosmos in the lost belt isbamazindlg and epic of rement which is hard,gives new gimics,and is coming out next year with cosmos in the lost belt coming in the year after"
I've watched this show idk what is it called but I love it first time playing this gameüòç
It doesn't open on my zte zmax pro as soon as I open it the game shuts down fix this and I will definitely change my rating and review thanks in advance
Pls don't ur wasting ur time on a bad anime game
Great game great story really addictive
"If you're a fan of the Fate/ series, you'll more than likely enjoy this game."
Too slow.
"I love it, just wish the gacha didn't hate me"
Ê∏∏ÊàèÂæàÂ•Ω ÊòØÊàëÂ§™Èùû
"If you enjoy the fate series, then you'll enjoy the plot. The summoning system is really a lie don't believe in rate up. Overall im addicted to it its fun and the grinding isnt that bad."
"These characters and the way you depict them is amazing! Some of my favorite heroes, even those unnoticed like Hektor are all in the game. It's just a great game"
Love this game it lit like fire
Literally the best mobile/gacha game out there
"It's grindy Fate/GO what do you expect?  This isn't for people without self control, the game rewards ten shot puller and each and ever servant is valuable to you.  Mashu is a wonderful servant, keep her levelling fast.  The other thing is you don't need five stars to make a good team! There are a ton of good and healthy 1, 2, 3 and 4 stars that are good! (Heracles is OP) also concerning separating crafts essences, they should NOT BE separated due to how much saint quartz you get anyways and you'll be too limited.  I recommend saving up for servants you want (Also Waver and Merlin.) I have 435 quartz in Stock right now.  I hope everyone finds this useful  Sorry if I took up your space lol.  I'm so glad this game is still going better than the JP release."
Good Game !
Best app üéÆ I've ever played
"Doesnt even open up, just keeps forcing error emails to pop up and crash on me..."
This game is very good
"Just another freemium level-up grinder. Was hoping for at least a bit of an entertaining story, as it spent a while setting up the premise. Nothing special, and battling is rendered pointless once you pull your first 4-5 summon."
The only game where I would glad spent a paycheck for my unit
I loved this game very much but i dont know my login info and i tried ti contact you guys to retrieve it back
"Too many words and cut scenes, had to delete."
Constantly crashing
Love the game and the series! The graphics are really good and the story is pretty good too. The gameplay mechanics are smooth and this game is very addicting.
"Doesn't support Note 8. When I launch the app, it wants to open an email app to post an error code. It reads out that it is not supported under my current environment. Oh well, and I was looking forward to this too."
Crashes immediately on Galaxy S9+ doesn't even open the app
Well it was a nice game but ther were alot of ads but the graphics were very cool still fun to play and i love it i guess very nicegame ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫üòÑüòÑ
"Garbage.  The art is subpar, the game play is uninteresting, and the gacha rates are the worst I've ever seen.  Servants and CEs are drawn from the same pool so even a guaranteed four star will rarely get you a high tier servant.   This game is a slap in the face and wallet to the franchises fans."
A very enthralling storyline on top of having characters that are very likeable with great gameplay as well.....nicely done
Any game that won't launch on jailbroken phones is a garbage game made by garbage people who should live in a dumpster with snails.
It's just right the system combat is uniqe.
Fantastic game! Love the graphics!
-game is not pay to win  -amazing graphics -amazing story -Gacha hell.
Needs better translators.
Game is very easy to play. Story is fun and engaging. Biggest downside to the game is trying to roll for 4 or 5 star characters. Not to mention materials/items are thrown into the mix. So you're even less likely to get characters by rolling.
"Honestly, games like this have a problem when it comes to summoning. I've spent money collected summoning quartz and still only have 1 actual 5 üåü. I do not mind grinding but when you only have 1 5 üåü. And 2 4 üåü characters. The game is not that fun. Especially when you spend your money."
YASSSSAAAA!!!!! I LOVE SAVOR AND ARCHER!!!!
"giving it a 3,m since I'm sure it'd be fun to play, but it won't even load the app on my phone, just sending me to send an e-mail to support on its not working. not worth the effort for me"
"Doesn't work. Never got passed the connecting screen. Asked to restart the game or check my service I tried on WiFi and cellular. A lot of questionable 5 Star ratings with no comments attached, probably employees or paid ratings."
Traps are still gay
Addicting.
For some reason the game opens my email for some odd reason... downloaded and reinstalled like 6 times...
The game is really fun and i wish you can do more after you finished all the levels and you have to wait for an update to unlock the other levels but over all the game is fun to play and get new servents
Fantastic and I feel like I'm in the game
"It's a great game... but I hate it that you need a code to transfer data... I broke my old phone so I can't play anymore, would be better if you could keep your stuff thru email account... but o well no longer playing"
"I really like this game  edting this review turns out my USB Mode was on so I just had to turn it off in order to play it but I still wish that the summoning feature was more fair, but I overall really like the game."
Just like the other guy said. It is very predatory. 1 saint quartz is a dollar lmao. You need 30 just to do a 10 draw. Rewards are very sparse and game is especially linear with no variation. You won't draw any of the characters that you like from the series. Graphics and gameplay are cool though
My biggest complaint is how the character/equipment is all the same draw. So saving my rare saint crystals for a 10 card draw hoping for a good character I end up getting mostly equipment cards. It should be separated. If I want character cards that's all I should get. If I need some equipment there I go. Played this for a bit. Got my 4 star in the tutorial and after many many crystals later still the same! Will spend my time on something that I actually have a chance on
Want even load just tried to send emails constantly
"If you're a fan of the fate series you'll enjoy this game. Voice acting for all the servants is great! The story is good, and the gameplay is engaging. Just don't expect much from the gacha; which isn't too bad since you can get through the story without needing SSR servants. Game is updated regularly with new content and events to keep you engaged. Give it a shot!"
If you have an LG phone don't download this because it will not work at all I hope they fix this at some point but not yet
Amazing game with a great story 10/10
"Not compatable with Gal S7, are you kidding me?"
Can't even play it
"9 out on 10 times it will not connect. Will only show a blank screen and the word ""connecting"""
Because every single time I play it it go me out
Best game I've ever played üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
"Played JP, loving the translation improvements"
The game is grate if you want to explore more on the anime series. Also nice wifu collector
"Simple mechanics on the surface but holds a fun amount of depth. You don't need to get anything above a 3* in order to complete the events, but if you stick around long enough, you'll get lucky enough to get a 5*. Also the event servants they give are pretty great most the time.  Playing purely f2p is entirely doable, and they are constantly coming out with new content.   The only downside is the gacha system. 1% chance to pull a 5 star, and the only guaranteed 5 star banners are paid only but happen twice a year. This can be frustrating If the character you really want is a limited 5* servant."
Still crashes on start on a Galaxy S7. Also crashes on start on Galaxy Note 8. Still crashing after the upgrade to oreo.
I love this game. It's awesome to play a game that is based off a anime series that everyone including myself likes.
Tried to play his game on my s7 but it tried to launch my email (app) every time. Couldn't play
Fun game. Read summoning rates before you spend real money.
"This is a fun game to be sure lots of classic fate characters, the graphics 
and music are fantastic, so are the animations.The story is good as well 
but the drop rates for 4 star servants and up are trash, you can sink over 
100 dollars into the game and not get a single 4 or 5 star while the game 
is doable with just 3 star servants it will take a while due to their lower 
stats overall it's a good game aside from the gotcha."
"Please help,for some reason my game is slower when I play with Wifi at home."
It is so very laggy to me can't even start my name in the begining of the game.
I love it so much !!!!!!!!!!!!
"Great and interesting characters, story, and magic system. Everything one expects from Type-Moon and Nasu. Events keep the action fresh and the community engaged. The only downside I feel is worth mentioning is that the gacha can be quite unforgiving, even when compared to other gacha games."
Waifu collection battle game 10/10
Great roleplay game! The graphics are great as well!
Wayyyyy too many text screens and dialogue with hardly any decent gameplay
"Can't play it. Not sure why, unless it doesn't play on the Galaxy s6 phones. It's up to date (the app and my phone) and I should have enough space on my phone, unless it takes up tons of space. Don't understand why it doesn't work which is a shame cause the game looks cool."
"After watching fait stay/night I started to like the series. Then after fate zero and Apocrypho I'm definitely a fan. Then I found there's a fate game once again I love, it's great. I would love English speech for the servants and hopefully there's going to be more added to because I don't think there's a multiplayer. But very fun"
Love the fate series and I mean granted I skipped the lore for the first 3 grail wars I read the next 2 and they were great
5 stars for no adsüëç
It crashes as soon as i boot up and will restart itself and crash again in an endless loop until i close the app. Will change review once this is fixed and i can actually play the game
Get your freaking ads out of Youtube! I've seen your ad 10 times in the past hour.  The only reason I downloaded this app was to say how annoying your ads are!
Well overall the game as well made and well put-together. The graphics are amazing for a free app in the game play is fun and enjoyable for hours on end honestly I Lose Myself playing this game but I do have to say with summoning I understand everybody can't always get what they want or always get 5 stars but I do wish they would make it a little bit better where we can at least get servants 4 or 5 stars because with the latest jalter event I had spent all my three free tickets and 30 Saint quartz that I had been saving up for this event and I got absolutely nothing I only got three stars and crafting essences. So overall this is a well made game I just wish the reward system was a little bit more fair
If any of y'all gotta know Astolfo is a dude
Jalter's my first 5 star. No whaling here.
I cant even log on
Fantastic game with an amazing story and plenty of characters to find the one who fits your play style
"Under all the terrible RNG there is a good game, addictive even. But the gacha system is by far the worst I've seen."
Just giving the game what it thinks of my luck.
Lol üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Really good.
Sweg
Super repetitive. Loading screens take forever. Boring.
This is a fun game.
It's a great game but sometimes it doesn't always let me start it up
Nope...
"The animations are great, and that animated cut scene wow... Great game recommend for people that has seen the anime!!"
A predatory gatcha system of the worst kind. See all those cool looking characters? Well you are never going to get any of them unless your willing to spend a whole lot of money. Save yourself the pain and play something else.
Drop rates are garbage.
Historical Waifus with fun gameplay
It's rad
"The gacha rate for higher star in this game is so low, overall it's a good game"
Waifus are always awesome. But I wish they made buying quartz a little more valuable
"I played the Japanese version a year or so ago and the game was addictive even with me not know what was being said, that being said I am looking forward to now knowing what is being said."
"I enjoy this game, yes, but I have a whole lot of problems with it. The first thing being saints quarts. As things stand saints quarts is way harder to get than it should be, you have to spend way too much time grinding repetative missions so you can get a single one. With the lack of an auto battle system this goes from fun to downright tedious. My second gripe is the summoning, as I said earlier you have to spend an extrodiante amount of time to get a single piece of saints quarts, to be fair the game has a system where you spend 30 and get a guaranteed 4 star or up, but the problem is, craft essences are put in that 4+ pool taking up a large majority of the chance, meaning you wasted enough time to get 30 quarts and still get absolutely nothing good. Or you can pay to win with a full 10 summon for about $24 and still literally get nothing. As the game stands, it has potential but it is not well thought out on the playing experience."
10/10 game
The rate up in this game is pretty bs
"The draw rate is pure utter garbage. If you want to enjoy the game with no stressing about rarity, you'll have fun. However, don't misunderstand. This is the zenith of gacha stinginess. You will seldom draw anything remotely of worth."
This marie girl immediately made me not want to continue playing with her annoying attitude. I also really could care less about getting to know her.
It is ok
It's fun!
A extremely fun game
I would recommend this game to anyone!
Fun but the method of acquiring heroes is a bit neh
Dank
Terrible story and character designs. The writing for the story and dialogue is horrible. The action would make up for some of this if it wasnt so repetitive. I dont know why this is considered an rpg since your selections mean nothing and everything plays out the same way. This is a far departure from what the Fate series started out as. Another one of my favorite franchises turned to trash.
"You know it's you guys at Delightworks are putting a stain on the Fate franchise. You guys don't even want to respond to people who are having issues with the game. It just shows that you guys really don't care about the Type-Moon fan base. You guys really don't deserve any money you have made. People have given you money hoping they could get the servant they want. Some of them have played this game for a bit over a year and still haven't gotten the servents they wanted. They gave you money only for you to take it and kick dirt in their face and walk away. I pray that you and companies like you all go bankrupt. You don't deserve any money you have. If Fate wasn't in the title, you guys wouldn't have anywhere near as much money as you do now and you know it."
I waited so long for an English version of this game and it's great!
A good game had to start over but other than that its a great game.
Pretty enjoyable look into the Fate/ universe
Give me Cu Alter I spent 270 quartz and 6 tickets for him you scallywags.
"i will make this short(but maybe long)...overall,this game itself is pretty bored..what make it hyped/overrated is because  1- anime character and animeish graphic 2- infamous drop rate/gatcha 3- a game from famous franchise from famous company..  seriously, give it a thought...if this game has different title with different characters,would people will spend time and money? I mean.. 1- gameplay is f****ing bored..seriously 2- the character..i mean,i dont know which is which anymore..too much people that have nothing to do with heroicism, unnecessary and genderbend.. omg..the genderbend..fate series use to be special..but know they just throw anything historical associated..maybe we can see assassin bin laden after this.. 3- the story is fine i guess..but only the main one... otherwise mostly weird and unnecessary.. 4- not rewarding..a game is about spend time to get reward,not spend time and money and not get anything..  and there,boom...i going to delete this game although i have ssr...bcoz hell yeah..."
Please increase the drop rates for 5 star servants the fact that you made them so low makes it impossible for players that can't spend money on the game to get them I only have one and that was from the tutorial
cool graphics
"This game is awesome!! You prob won't like it if ur not here for waifus and husbandos, but story is quite decent!! I like"
If you can ignore the gacha the game is awesome epic characters gameplay and story its really fun...
Hard to get 5 star servant lol
Can't stop won't stop its a addictive game especially for people who like collecting things
Good to see characters from the shoe appear with other legends as well.
"Lost everything  Don't get me wrong! I think this game is 5 star material.  Was going to login after the da Vinci counterfeit event the past 4 hours ago But I just got ""Fate Go keeps crashing"" and thought I had to uninstall it.  I did what I did and uninstalled it and now I lost everything. Played this game 223 days straight,  Master level 109,  lvl 100 Jeanne! 134 Saint Quartz! All lost! Not changing this review until I work my way up through everything AGAIN!!!!!"
I enjoy it as much as I enjoy the show
Very fun and detailed!
Bathory...
"This game is really fun, the only issue is the AP. You can play like 3 missions before you are pretty much done for a few hours until it recharges."
"Game drop rate of good characters are trash, freezes to much, prices are high and unreasonable and you can farm for weeks and months and still don't get a descent team of 4 or 5 stars. Not worth it, its only good because of the anime and character, that's probably why it has 4.4 rating."
"Surprisingly deep and engaging gameplay for a mobil game, though i wish there were more handsome and burly men in addition to all the beutiful and cute women"
Awesome game and nice arts!
"Its a fun game. but, its only you. No way to communicate with other people. Summons rates are garbage, you mostly get craft essence, and it takes a TON to summon. the stuff to summon with are expensive and not worth spending real money on. Good to pass time though."
Best franchise ever and would play it over n over!
"One of the more balanced gatcha games.  You can finish the entire game with 3 and 4 star servants, so summons are just for wanting certain servants."
"I love you , but i hate you , but i love you , but i hate you ... (0.1% for a 5*)"
It's fun in general I got a better understanding of the game when I finished the fate series
Best game i ever played
I actually really like this game now
Best Game in Market
"I haven't had the chance to actually play this game. I have the app in a folder on my home screen of apps I'm eventually gonna try out, but even though I've opened this app only once for a few minutes, here's what happens. For the past several weeks something has been closing whatever app I'm currently in, forcing me to abruptly end what I'm doing, and then telling me to choose an app to open something else. With no instructions and not knowing what to do, I choose Gmail. What I then see is a completely filled out error report from this app telling me to ""contact us via email"" as it turns out. I've sent this email several times with no response and no fix. I haven't had the chance to even play this game and it's already the most insufferable app on the market. From both a user's perspective and a programmer's, this is the worst way to handle an error. The fact that there's even an error at all while I'm not even running the app is ludicrous. Congratulations, you've lost a potential player. This is fortunate for me because I've been trying to decide on apps I could delete to free up space. That's one more down."
Cannot recommend as long as the game requires you to keep your device in 100% pristine condition software-wise. The 3rd party firmwares I installed I did so because I was plugging security holes on my device.
Cant play always fails to connect
Love the hell out of this game and the series as a whole but RNG in this game is well let's just say I've budget fate go into my paycheck/bills lol
"A three for now. I really love the Fate series and I, when it lets me, enjoy this game. Reminds me of another game I played on Facebook.  My main issue right now is that it constantly crashes after about 10 minutes usually during loading. I do hope it is fixed soon. May become my main game if I can play longer than 10 minutes."
Girl üò≥üòõüëÆüëÆüëÆüëÆ
"Annoying af. Long, unskippable tutorial that did not need to be there. Redundant and unnecessary."
"It had a great beginning‚Äã, but then one day it froze on the loading screen and no matter what I tried it wouldn't load. I love this game, but make sure you have a good device."
Tech support fixed my issues with the game. Good all around.
It's a pretty  cool game  with amazing story
"Will not open, using Pixel 2 XL"
Amazing game full of action and excitement
I just plain love it.
"It is a good game but it keeps crashing when I'm not even playing on it. Also it's difficult to get heroes and there should probably be a summons for heroes and one for crafting essense. Peraonally, I don't want to throw away my stones on only crafting essense filled summons. There should be some that also lets you link or save your progress so if you have to delete the app for what ever reason you don't have to constantly start over each time."
Won't even start. Clicking on the game icon tries to launch email. What? Then screen flashes repeatedly and nothing happens.
Game is all around great in my opinion
One of the best gacha games out there now. Very generous free units from events. No pvp or p2win.
Crashes often and hard to roll for a specific servant. Otherwise great game and concept. Edit: my phone is just crappy. Works fine after I moved it to ipad.
Awesome Game 5 stars
Frick yeah amigo corn my hobble dobble
The best mobile game I've ever played. Great gameplay and a surprisingly good story worthy of the Fate franchise
It is a Placent game
"The game won't even start. I restarted my phone. Then I tried uninstalling the game. Then reinstalling the game. Still doesn't start. All it does is give me a prompt to my email to tell me that it doesn't play in my current environment. I sent an email to the admin, but didn't get a response back."
"The dang game doesn't work!! Everytime I install and try to open the app, it is a pure white screen and then says there is an error and tries to get me to send an email to support, which never goes anywhere... I would love to try the game..  but it simply doesn't work."
Can't actually play.
"Gameplay is fun, alright main story, and hilarious events happen throughout the year.  Characters have tons of personality, as is expected from a Fate game.  Unfortunately, a high amount of playtime is required to do anything, microtransactions are overpriced, and the rarity distribution is skewed.  About half of servants are SR or SSR, during rate-up this means you will have a ~2% and .7% chance of getting what you want respectively.  People have spent over a grand on this game and still fail to get what they want.  Also features a plethora of daily and weekly chores to do.  Great potential squandered."
"Hey, your walking into hell."
HTC M8 Game crashes please fix
The game is fun and addictive I can't wait till the next Event comes but only thing I don't really like is the gatcha getting 5 stars is near impossible other than that I have no complaints overall it's a awesome game
It is awesome
Great game but my old phone broke and there's no way to recover my data without the transfer code
It's    a    good    game
Should add an auto battle button.
I love the game because I'm a big fan of the series. The fact the some of the attacks are similar to the ones in the show is great
"If you enjoy the series AND can keep expectations in the common sense range, then you should enjoy this game. Great characters art."
It's a great way to pass the time
I HAVE A PROBLEM. IM TRYING TO BUY QUARTZ BUT IT STOPS MY PLAY STORE FOR SOME REASON AND SO MY GAME CRASHES EVERY TIME I TRY TO BUY QUARTZ. IT HAPPENS EVRYTIME.
I liked the game but would it be possible to get my account back or add a fb sync? I love the game but I uninstalled and didn't get my code
Fun game made to eat your money for your favorite 5* fate waifu with a 1% success rate. The game is mostly for fans of the fate series.
"For fans of the fate series, this game is amazing. Even new comers will enjoy this game with it's fresh take in jrpg game play and fun servants to use."
Best of the best warriors battle it out with or without friendship!!!
It's coping attack on titans
Beat me up and took all my money but I'm okay with it.
Best game ever played
"I was iffy at first, but I love this, especially all the servants~"
The stuff
Best rpg ever
"Absolutely adore this game. amazing animation, story, gameplay, etc... basically an all-around 5 star game. my one and only issue is that it takes up WAY to much space on my phone, unfortunately had to delete for this reason, as i had no space for anything else, not even youtube. if you have plently of space to spare, then I 110% reccomend at least giving the game a try."
My bank account hates me because of this game.
It's a pretty good game.
"This game is cool and fun, but I cannot play effectively because it keeps closing automatically. If the closing can be fixed, I would play more."
Won't open so can't play. Device is android tablet.
The best animation in a mobile game ive seen by far
"Its great, I love this game so much"
"It's an awesome game,and addictive to play"
Customer service is amazing. They did really good job with this game. ^-^
"Absolute 5/5. For other mobile games I can't  get into them, but this game gets me going as someone who mostly plays on home consoles and PC. If you are a huge fan of the Fate series, I highly recommend you to play this. This game isn't pay to win at all, and it is all about getting servants (or characters) you want. More specifically, waifus and husbandos."

"Well I've tried playing this once again after not touching it for months and nothing has changed. Still crashes during tutorial, if I'm lucky to get passed that it crashes during hero summoning as well. Sorry but I can't fully 5 star this like I want to. It does seem like an amazing game and a game I would play for hours on end but without any kind of miracle, I'm sorry to say but this game will fade away from my thoughts."
If you lose the game for what ever reason don't expect to get your account back even if you spent money in game
The downloding is too long it takes forever
"Drop rates are super low, just be aware of that going in and it isn't so bad"
Virus of an app. Brought up enough new message emails to crash my phone. Beware.
The best game ever played plus a big fan of the Fate series
"Give us full steering wheel controls, ok nintendo."
I'm reviewing this to give it a more unbiased judgment one thing you need to know that's very important is what is good against what. Lancers archers and Sabres. You understand the triangle combat system it's pretty easy after that. Another thing you really want to do even when you're just starting out is the dailies take note of the level next to the Daily. Another thing always use support character. Preferably a strong one. If you want to level that is if you like the challenge use one closer to your level. The one thing this game has that your probably not going to like is that your going to have to study weaknesses and strengths a lot kind of lame I know but you're just going to have to get used to it.
I got kicked out of the game randomly and it won't accept my transfer code and password. very irritated but what are you gonna do.
"Great story, lost of heros, and plenty of events. Only downside is rate up is a lie"
"I've spent $70,000 on this game there is your love sony"
The game is amazing. I am just upset that they couldn't help me recover my account. Have to start all over.
"It's ok, gatcha rolls are trash overall. But the heroes are cool once you have them. But they're hard to rank up. It has the most complicated and confusing mechanics for managing inventory, I hate that. Fire emblem was easier to get into while this feels like I lose my playpoints too quick. The campaign and free saints quartz are so little compared to all the events we need to wait for. The events are too quick and even change who you get on a daily basis, that's annoying. Just stay the same throughout the event don't wait for me to spend my quartz to change the gatcha the exact day after within the SAME event."
"Will not load past 6%,so much for this game"
It's really fun game and I have fun whenever I play it.
"I loved the. I love the franchise, the characters,etc. I love this game and it's engaging story.  I hate the 1% gacha hell.  If they split raft essences and servants into two separate banners it'd be better, as craft essences are vital and add fun. But it's hard to love the game if you can't get your favorite servants.  It'll never happen, so take it for what it is: fun as hell once you get it down."
Too bad its rigged. You wont get anything good from free quartz lol.
"Art looks okay, and gameplay looks interesting but what killed me is the rate of 5 star. I don't care if you don't need it to beat the game, if you make something that super unobtainable..the game loses it's luster. I'ma go back to feh."
U M U !
Can't play. A S7 Edge can't play the game. Hmm. Garbage.
"just amazing, but wish there was an auto feature, so that I wouldn't have to constantly keep looking back every 30 secs"
Tremendous Interaction  I really like the gameplay and storyline interaction that goes along with it. It just keep crashing when I try to play for a couple-fewhours and that is what I don't like(crashing games or games that crash on me while I play it)
Addictive fun
I love this game so much and Nightingale is wife 10/10
Awsome!
"""unplayable"""
Game doesn't run on rooted phones.
Fun game but it would be nice if there was a setting to make the camera static rather than follow the characters.
Its amazing all around but my only issue is if mash can awaken/evolve or whatever you wanna call it
Thanx
"The game will randomly close on me in battles, please help"
It opened me up to something the movie didn't
All around great game.
Can't start game on galaxy note 5... Always crashes no matter what with uninstall and reinstall/ clear cache...
"When I click the icon, it closes and open PayPal. I have none rooted note 8."
"This game doesn't even start.  You touch the icon for it and all it does is bring up a ""share with"" prompt.  The actual app NEVER starts.  Complete waste of time and the bandwidth needed to install it. Just tried the latest build.*STILL* doesn't run.  Now it tries to open up a mail client.  An embarrassment to the Nasuverse"
Just a Great game all around. They also have a great support staff  after trying multiple times to transfer my data to my new phone I contacted the support who kindly and very quickly helped me retrieve my profile.
"Won't load. Says it's not playable in my environment. Using a non-rooted S7 in USA,  so not sure what the issue is. Looks like a fun game."
It's all about the waifu
Great game 1000000000 out of 10 good fate game
"First freemium game I decided to throw down money on. Worth it, great game."
"The graphic design for the game is great, as is the story thus far.  Where the game falters is the levelling system.  Battles mean nothing to levelling your characters.  Instead, you have to hope to receive specific items to grant xp to your individual party members.  Once you max your xp, you can ascend a character to gain access to more levels, but you need sets of random items that only drop from specific enemies, which also randomly generate in each battle.  For instance, two of my characters are sitting at their maximum level before ascending, and have been at that level for two weeks or more because both need four of an item which only drops in a daily quest on Thursday.  I've managed to get two total of that item thus far.  If there was some other way of getting these items, then the game wouldn't be half as frustrating.  When you add in the rarity of characters of different classes, it just compounds the frustration.  I'm sitting on over a hundred Saber xp cards because I still don't have a character to use them on.  Saint Quartz, the currency to purchase random draws for characters and craft essence cards, has only a finite source to get in game, and takes three Quartz to draw one single random item.  Otherwise it costs $23.99 to get a minimum amount to purchase the thirty needed to get a ten pack of draws that guarantee a four star ranked item.  These cards pull from the same limited list as the free daily summons, so it is very likely that you can get a ten pack with nothing but the items from the free daily, despite the cost of the paid pack.  Your enjoyment of the gameplay will depend entirely on your luck with random drops and draws, and the battles serve virtually no purpose other than to waste time and resources."
Gatcga
Liked the gameplay so much that I got into the Fate universe because of this game and its companion anime. Some of the characters should have reused their English voices from the anime
Sekai de ichiban tsuyoi
"I love it. It has some of my favorite characters, I just wish there was a better chance of getting the higher ranked servants."
A good silly game
Won't even open on pixel 2xl.
I love the game in all
Great game but it's hard to get 5 stars you've got be really lucky to get them
Great story and very engaging. Amazing graphics and attention to detail
I can't wait for kiritsugu ;;
I love all the characters and the servents and how you can upgrade them.
Waifu simulator but actually fun
If you're a fan of the fate series or of any series from the nasuverse then this game is for you.
This is one of the single best games on the app store. It's fun and fair. 10/10
"Great game, but the in app purchases are outrageously expensive. Don't fall for the spending trap as the game can be completed free to play."
It's good but 5 stars need lots of cash
It's one of the best games I have but when I downloaded the English version I was hoping for at least some English speakers but I guess not
Great game aniplex just seems a little stingy with saint quartz compared to other p2p games
Berry cool
I love it except for the rate drop on servants
gimme apologems devs owo
"Waifus, holy waifu wars. That is all."
Fun and addictive.
Awesomeness!!! Thanks so much.
It is a simple charming nasuverse game not much more to say.
The game is great but I'm wondering? Where my boy sieg. If you add him and his possed form I would freak out and be extremely happy. It would also make the game a whole lot better so please add sieg
"fun game, good graphics, likeable characters. it's a great game."
I'm a huge fan the franchise!
"Finally,  all my dreams come true."
"This game has some serious potential to be great, if only they separated the craft Essence and hero summons in two different categories so we can pull from either and get what we need. Because I have been screwed over by the craft Essences so badly that it actually makes me enjoy this game a lot less especially with how hard it is to get the resources to summon anyway. I love this game and if that was the main problem fixed I would give this game a full five stars it is an amazing game and has a great story behind it. I got into the Fate series because of this game."
The gacha is hell
"Great game. No competitive or pvp elements, which means you can progress at your own pace."
Help
"The story is superb and the event side stories in between major arcs just add that much more it's charm. Mind you, this is a gacha game and spending money is probably expected. You don't have to though. Being free to play is very viable and you'll see videos of players taking down major and end game and event bosses with 1-3 star teams quite frequently. The gameplay is simple, yet gratifying. I would highly recommend giving the game a swing."
I think its a good game
It sucks and it wont let u get your account back even if u entered it when u firat played it cuz it said to me this:your transfer number is already in use. Dont play this game as a warning cuz it sucks
I love the Characters and it's differing Art styles
Fun game the only thing i don't like is there are ascension items that are hard to get and rarely drop on missions if they would fix that some how that would be great
"Awesome game, make sure you have the ram to run it."
B.o.r.i.n.g
This game is not starting up on my samsung s8
Translation needs improvement.
This game makes a person think and that's why I enjoy playing it so much! Plus its a dream come true for me playing this game. Not new player friendly though!
would love to play if it would work on my s8+
Crashed once or twice every hour but other than that is awesome
The game crashes so often I barely get 2 minutes into it.
Terrible game!
The game crash on start on my s4 running lollipop
"This is a great game for casual gamers. The only problrm is aniplex themselves and their dogsh** customer support and account binding systems, i have lost a few accounts that i spent money on and forgot my info on it. Why cant they just bind ur info with twitter, google, facebook or an online account system where u log in to get your data. I see this game very unattractive for me because i tend to switch out phones alot and i dont save my transfer code everytime. If you planning to play this game remember to bind account and save it so u do not have to deal with the customer support. Also Jeanne is a trash summon dont go for her kappa"
Wouldn't launch
When I'm trying to open it just says share via email always I played this game on my tablet and it had no problem whatsoever.
Keeps kicking me out. Very frustrating
"Overall is good, could be great if prices were decent as opposed to actual prices for in-app purchases which are ridiculous. RNG either doesn't work or is designed to be against the player since it takes lots of summonings to get characters you desire, if it was luck then that would be a different story... Unnecessary items are placed in both ""gacha"" type of elements to the game, my advice: divide and don't repeat, if you have certain ""cards"" (essences or servants) available for discovery in one ""gacha"" system, don't put any of those in the other... it's a rocky mistake that a game such as this I would've never expected to make."
"You gave me 5 star servants, you get 5 stars from me"
Best storyline that never give me bored
O.k. bring it on. I'm really to fight. ‚ú¥
"A great game representing the Fate franchise and Nasuverse. The story is coherent and deep in its lore while the game play has strategic elements to it.   While the gacha rates for 5* are abysmal, you do not need them in order to ""win"" the game. I've used plenty of 3* units and have been carried by them due to their unique abilities.  There are plenty of events that show the wacky side of the Fate series. They are riddled with inside jokes and serve as fun fillers in between the usually serious story."
Keeps  opening my email app and crashing. Tried to take over my phone.
Best mobile game I've ever played
The is not working a all
Great Graphics I love this game
"I really do enjoy this game, it's fun to play and has some great back stories. I just wish they would increase the drop rate with hero summoning."
Would be great if it wasn't constantly crashing on my tablet
"Favorite anime, if you haven't seen it watch it. If you seen it and never played this you're missing outüòÜ"
Its a bit laggy on some weaker devices but its a good time spender and if you are a fate fan this is absolute heaven.
Game won't even load. I get an error.
"Well for one, the summoning tickets make me angry especialy when you earn them from a really tough event just to not get a character but instead get a craft essence that you've gotten 7 times in a row from only these tickets. Other than that i love this game and it can be a lot of great fun."
Addictive but too much talking not enough action
Just WOW
Its ok maybe more updates could be better to make the summons and button placement better maybe more things on the screen and yea
Beautiful writing fun characters and great personification of myths and legends
Hated it
So happy you have archer that was named shirou loved him in the show
Insta-crashes on app launch right after install
It a good gacha but it has a poor account recovery method which can make you lose money on a account you may not get to access again so don't recommend to much money for a pull
Mordred  best girl
"This is essentially a single player rpg with gacha, so there is no pressure to roll (as there is no pvp) unless there is a character you want.  The story is extensive so it is easy to find characters you like, and many of the 3 or 4 star characters you can get for free are viable as type advantage is very important."
"This game is MIND BLOWINGLY awesome (that's not even a word, I made it up to describe how amazing this game is)....I only wish it was updated more frequently, like when is the English version gonna get next update!? I NEED ANSWERS!!!"
This game cured my depression
Waifu Collector Simulator
Would love to play but I download it and it keeps crashing. I haven't even seen the home screen.
"How can I review this without sounding like other games who paid to have excellent reviews?  You can't, it really is that good.  Yes, it grinds at times, and translations are deliberately made hilarious, but there are constantly rotating events every month, whole new content updates every 3-6 months that add upwards of 10+ hours of content, and half a dozen new characters as well with each update. As it is, this version is nearly 2-3 years behind the JPN version, which has 2.5x the characters and 4x the maps. All of which is slated to come to the US/International version."
"All your FSN+ characters, story is amazing, simple gameplay mechanics, but you'll eventually come to a block with ascension materials cause you realize rates are like trying to pull 5 star characters. Then the fun ends."
"really tried playing this game , as a new player :( it's sure not F2P friendly , way to time consuming and the pull rate is unfair / ill just stuck to the Anime:)"
It's ok. Not great. But ok
It doesn't connect to Google or a Cloud. You will lose all your data if the game bugs out or if you delete the app.
Eh
"It's a fun, easy to grasp franchise that has a ton of fan favorites and there is always something to do."
The rates on gacha are freaking horrendous.
Its really good to play
You should make a smartphone version of fate/ excella
Much like the world of Warcraft none of you are here by choice anymore.
"I would love to try playing however Everytime I try , I finish the download, attempting to load the game and it just kicks me back to my home screen."
"This game is great just don't ever wast your money on!!! Makes the game worse because the drop rates are VERY, VERY bad for anything you want. I've played alot a phone games and the story is really good the game play meh, just really DON'T SPEND ANYTHING ON THIS GAME ruins it."
Been playing the game ever since launch. An all around good game. There are some issues but I haven't experienced anything major.
"Played the JP version, loved it, was thrilled when this was announced, became whale (real money spender) play this game for great fun and great waifus!"
"I'm not really one for mobile games, but I love the nasuverse, so I don't regret picking this up. Edit: I've since become addiceted to gacha, may rng have mercy on my soul."
Can't even play it. Like at all.
Such a lovely game
Just crashes everytime the tutorial pops up on my galaxy 3 pro. The 2 minutes of play time i actually got between dialogue frames was fun but it was an hour of dialogue the 2 minutes of play time then more tutorial another tutorial with bugs crashing the game. Really sad because i like the fate series and really wanted to play this.
"I can't properly write a review, because it won't even open up with my Samsung S7 phone."
Amazing :)
A bit too much of a grind to get a summon buying summons isn't even worth it most of the time
If you love Fate you will simply lose yourself in this game. Just be sure to roll responsibly.
I like the game but it returns me back when I get to play it
"Overall a good game. The gameplay is simple and easy to get into while still being fairly unique with depth to it, particularly when you get to the more difficult content. As of now, all of the content can be cleared by lower rarity units (i.e. completely free) provided you put some thoughts into your strategy. That being said, the chances off getting a high rarity unit is quite low. The story is lacking compared to other series in the Fate franchise, but is decent for this type of mobile game. The events happen often enough to keep the game interesting, but not so often that it becomes stressful to grind. However, while the events are great, there isn't much to do in between the events after you clear the main story quests/free quests. Furthermore, while being able to borrow your friend's servants is nice, there isn't much you can do beyond that with other players, which is somewhat disappointing."
"As a fan of the show, I like it."
Dope xD
"Another Fate Visual Novel, only with a deep turn-based RPG system to go along with it. Kickass!"
Ok game but I spent 87$ and didn't get the person/character I really really wanted fix the drop rate
Addicting and fun
Didn't run on my s7. Will change rate if they fix.
This game owns my life now. This gatcha is unforgiving but im to masochist to stop trying to get the wiffu and husbando. Cant syop. Wont stop.
5 stars for dev response time and resolution
"The good: Looks great, the plot is passable and occasionally entertaining, the variety of servants and the many scenes they each are allowed is great for fans. The bad: The load times are horrible, the servant summons are high cost with extremely limited free points, summon rates are awful for 3*+ servants and if you get a 5* it's likely just another craft item you'll just feed to another item, leveling requires grinding a specific enemy or paying for it, evolving requires grinding against super low drop rates, every battle except bosses is extremely monotonous which makes the grinding even worse. For diehard Fate/ fans this is probably worth while if you just want to see new servants, but after playing a few months the dull and grind heavy gameplay for little reward killed it for me. It's also hard to recommend this to new players since much of the evolving items with otherwise low drop rates are gained en masse through events that have already passed and make starting anew slower. The updates try to keep with the original Japanese release schedule so those short summon events get their time, but unless you're throwing a lot of money you'll only get to do a couple of summons per month after catching up on story anyways. Tl;dr: If you can handle grinding with servants you probably don't care about after long loading screens play it. If you like lore just look at the wiki since this version will always be years behind the Japanese one."
Love the game but it won't let me in the game anymore hoping you guys could do something about it when it was just working fine yesterday
"The game has a good story and the combat system is very unique. Even events are unique to as they give yiu a guaranteed 4 star servant if you work hard enough. Both standout to make this game one of the best mobile games anime fans can find.  But as for its shortcomings that's where it ruins it for anybody that has terrible luck. The summoning system is quite broken as in if you spend over 200$ to try to get a 5 or 4 star servant, your chances are slim to none and can be quite frustrating. And at most times when you pull a 4 or 5 star, it's a craft essence and not a servant."
I didnt think there was a game that had worse roll rates than final fantasy brave exvius until i played this game. This game isnt so f2p friendly either so dont bother playing unleds you got $$$ to dump on this game  ******Edit******* Just wanted to update my review n let u guys kno this game is still trash. Dont bother playing it
App shuts down like each round
"Cannot even open this game. It gives me a long error about playing environment, Then proceeds to force close itself."
"Just another rpg with extremely crappy rates don't let the fate ip fool you, f2p here and I had 153 saint quarts and 5 summon tickets ( summoning currency) and got nothing but 3 star servents after 5 10x pulls and the five tickets another thing that will annoy you are these craft essence pulls (which need good servents to be utilized to it's best potintial) have higher rates than the servents so enjoy getting 5 star essence (which again will eventually need 5 star servents because the Stat boost for 3 or 4 stars won't be enough for them) but only 3 star servents after the free 10x after the tutorial which gives you a four star just to butter you up."
Reason I gave liw rating is because it won't let me play it wants to open with a email or a messenger never heard of such thing before until it's fixed I won't be playing
"This game... Where to start? So the Fate series is easily one of my favorite anime series. And this game starts out promising, but it becomes apparent later on that this is just a game to milk Fate fans. The premium currency is expensive and the way to earn free premium currency is slow and runs out when you hit the end game. I loved the game at first, but it quickly turned sour as I continued to play the game. The game had major optimization issues at launch and it took them a long time to fix the problems. The game looks good except for some wonky animations. The story is okay at best due to the fact that it is filled with tons of filler content and it just never really goes anywhere. What should be a love letter to Fate fans is just a platform to milk them. And now we get into drop rates... Dear lord they are some of the worst rates I have seen in ANY mobile game. 1% rates for some of the best characters in the game and the events will actively try to screw you over by having items to make your character better go away with the event, so if you didn't sit there and grind for hours you are outta luck. Plus event summon characters can have less than 1% drops as well. So be prepared to get screwed over in that regard. And then there is the fact that I lost my account and multiple tries to reach out to the English devs have been met with... Silence. So this game can go rot for all I care. Spent money on this game to only lose my account. Thanks devs."
"This game definitely appeals to the majority of players who are quite familiar with the Fate series in general. It also is a real treat for those who are unfamiliar with the series due to the game's story and mechanics. All in all, it's brilliant!"
For fans of the Fate Series this is a must!
It is a great game
Can't give a zero but if I could on I would. I can't even log on.
Art is good but the game is simplistic and boring. You will only really like this if you are a Fate-fanboy otherwise it's not a keeper
Cool story. Lacking in gameplay
"Wish I could actually try to play this game, but every time I try to load it I just get an error code and when I send off the email to support I receive no answers or response. I'll happily change this review if I can play the game."
Very fun and addictive game
"This is a fantastic sequel to Pok√©mon:GO. I lost faith in the CS:GO series when I saw how underwhelming PoGO was with its gameplay and new features. However, once I heard that they were overhauling everything in their new sequel, I decided to try it again. Despite removing AR, I enjoyed that they added new Pok√©mon based on mythology. This made the series become fresh although I object the method of obtaining new Pok√©mon. Also they revamped the combat system to become more enjoyable albeit more convoluted and they finally added a useful friend feature. This sequel made me feel alive again and I cannot wait for the next game in the series."
Its a really good game fun to play just from time to time it will say its not responding when its not open or being used.
"Awesome game, love the story"
Great graphics
No way to link or bind your account means you're out of luck if your phone happens to wipe or break. Customer support is extremely unhelpful asking for things like a random 9 digit ID you obviously would not have if you lost your data.
Great game. You can get your waifus here. Enjoyed it pretty much. Very fun and addicting. Immense card combat. Awesome gameplay. A lot of grinding and getting as much as you want!
"Another fate classic, easy and addictive. Full of plenty of fate originals."
"Great game, just wish it had S8 full screen support! ^_^"
Solid gameplay and pretty reasonable gacha draw rates
"It's a fun game. Reminds me of devil maker Tokyo, but with fate characters."
"It's a great game, but the concept is quite confusing. I've tried using the help menu available however it's terribly slow to load and too simplistic. Unfortunately the app currently crashes every time i try to play but I'm not going to let that dissuade me.   I recommend the app, the artwork is great and pleasing to the eyes.   It came out for the west a couple days ago so i can't complain to much, hopefully they will hash out some of the issues soon."
Jalter is best waifu
It keep sending me to gmail please fix it
Takes too long to load. &gt;:(
I love how it has characters from all across the Fate series
Its cool
Love it and great for waifu collection
"Great story, Great gameplay, and great characters. Everything in this game is great."
The game doesnt let me to past the loading screen
Prefect game
its interesting thats all i gotta say
It's the rates there terrible don't expect anything unless you spend a he'll of a lot of cash even if it's rates up
Gacha rolling ruins it.
Got tried of it opening gmail for no reason. And crashing i tried it on another phone same issues
I was trying to roll for a kaleidoscope craft essence but got spooked by black keys and Shiki saber. Overall 10/10 let's me see my waifus in action and Cu is still best dog.
The game is great but I only wish that servant level in battle it would make it easier to lv up
I love the Fate universe the mythos behind everything . You know i think the hardest thing about this game is finding similar games that play the same way.
"As a fan of the Fate anime series, I'd been enjoying the story and characters, even though the gameplay is just another hero-collector RPG. However, the game no longer starts after the most recent update, even after reinstalling."
Good story and combat but crashes sometimes.still fun game thought
Best app game I own
So we have a year to live? Lol jk jk
Best game ever played has an anime as well? Oh yeah
This fate game includes characters from every fate series amazing but I do wish the summons were a little less cheaper.
Rather play with human feces
My screen is blank. The letters are white boxes.
To much lag it's hard to play because the game is lagging to much during battles.
Loved it but caused Network errors and said it didn't respond even when I didn't active the app.
Best game I've played on mobile
"I would really love to play this game, but when I download it and try to open it it crashes everytime so I can't even okay it please fix this"
Immediately exits on Android 8.1
"I think that this game is great on more than one level. It's story driven from a great franchise, it's not a Gacha Hell, fun to play and it's never too late to start."
Best game I've ever played on the mobile
It's amazing to me because it lets me see more servants that I haven't seen in the anime before and I am a bit of a Fate fan.
Happy to have found this game a and as well I the anime too
"I love it, I watched Type: Moon anime and I love all the references to the visual novel genre."
Such a fan of the seires love the anime
"Love the game, I really enjoy that you (the game designers) made sire to include bios for each character. The graphics are great and the noble fantasums are week done. The only thing I would like to see if maybe a fast pass mode or like a multi skip mode. Like one battle can count as five. Otherwise great game."
"It's a good game. However, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE to transfer your Data over onto any device, instead of having to use the one you Transferred to lastly."
"Good story, easy mechanics. Highly recommended"
Beautiful and just very fun
JUST SPEECH-LESS
"FGO is a mediocre game at best. The combat system is not bad. The level design is terrible. You do the same thing over and over. It's only at the boss stage where it changes. The story is forgettable. The gacha is the worse part of the game. 1% to get a 5 star is way too low. Not to mention that certain servants only available for a low period of time, and they won't come back for a while. FGO should've done what FEH did by including pity rates. The game is very , and I mean very grind heavy. It really makes it even more boring and tedious. The UI is straight forward. No complications. The character designs are fantastic. The sprites are pretty good also. They will also update them. Thumbs up for that. Overall, I can only really recommend FGO for the hardcore fate fans. I'd give it a 2.5/5."
Into the woods in garden of sinners is impossible
Love so much
Won't let me play keep sending me to gmail to send error messages.
I really loved  it!
"It's a GREAT game, addictive in the beginning and still grabs your attention as you keep moving on, the only bad thing is it's hard to get the summoning crystals"
Garbage. App wouldn't even open in S8+. Just kept prompting to open my email client. Fix this garbage as I know it's a legit game
Love the fate series. This is a great version of such.
Good game i just want to unlock my fovorite character alexander the great
"Well, having historical elements was nice. Story change from history is expected. Interesting characters, nice art. Gameplay was a tad lackluster... Very straightforward but, lacking in any general technique. Leveling was not grand. Most recent update has me unable to login. Not the first game that's done this to me... Luckily, I didn't spend any $ in it."
"A fun game for history, fate, and anime fans."
Awesome game lot of fun when you have a lot of free time.
"all about the waifu's, but still fun in its own way."
Good grind. One of the better rpgs out there.
"Very cool, very fun.  Must have for Fate fans.  Best phone game I've ever played."
The god damn gatch got me....
Just all around fun and addicting to play.
10/10 *clap*
"Fantastic, great for any Fate fans"
Enjoyed it well over the months
Love it. Especially because they didn't censor to cater to the west and kept the art intact.
For fate series fans it a good game
A must have mobile game for any Type-Moon fan.
It's an amazing game with so many great servants
Soiled by typical mobile game cashgrab mechanics but fun overall
Love it. One warning. Rate up is a lie. Also rerolling is good for noobs.
"I'm fairly impressed by the way the game attempts to place a strategy game into a visual novel, but the unforgiving gacha simply spoils the game."
Love....
"Supreme waifumon game. In-app purchases mad overpriced, but playable without them."
"No offense, but this game gave me a  headache while playing just for a few minutes. The characters dashing back and forth and I keep seeing the  same skeleton as enemy. The disconnection issue and retry again baffled me since it's an offline game right? The most enjoyable was the free  summoning for the first , but using other player support character crush mind lol. Well I guess I'll be sticking to the new final fantasy Dissiadia."
Best for WAIFU junkies!!  Build your own fighting harem
Developers are stingy as they come. You will spend a week trying to get a full pull. But even then the drops for a 5 star is 1%
Just waiting for Astolfo
"Amazing, Addictive,  Challenging"
It was really a great game i loved it and hope you continue your work.
Great game all together
"Installed the app, opened it, then it opened up my email app without my permission and tried sending an email requesting data migration or something like that."
Awesome game love the storyline. Just wish I can summon more often.
Only complaint is that Saint Quartz are ungodly expensive. One 10x summon for a guaranteed 4* CARD (not necessarily a servant) will cost you $25
Love the story great graphics and controls I would rate higher but it keeps crashing randomly
"Excellent game! Love it. So fun, so addictive. Playing for free is viable. Wish the game had bluetooth mouse and keyboard support though, as I like to play for long durations and doing so on my phone can be tedious."
This game could be amazing but I'll never know cause from the moment I installed it I kept getting email error messages. Game hasnt loaded or run once
Love everything about this game! It's so addicting!
"Game lags out real bad, often crashing, also, it's file size is massive for a mobile app, making it difficult to update any other apps on your phone."
I'm a big fan of the fate series and thus this game drew itself twords me and I personally enjoy it
This game is a cancer.  Have to turn off debug mode to play??  Absurd requirement..  No thanks and good riddance
"Look, I really like and enjoy the game and the series as a whole.  But can you please make the game more supportable  for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. Once in a while the game crashes and the frames go low. I even download  the extra data in the Game Options so it can run more smoothly, but not even that would fix the crashing  and a bit of lag problem. Please when you guys can, fix this problem  please :)"
"I really love this game but I decided to uninstall it months ago because it eats up too much space in my internal storage. But I decided to install it again today, and frustrated because I was stucked in the logo portion. After the logo shows up and tapping the screen, the screen just turns black and froze there, showing ""Fate GO is not responding"". Hope you can fix this problem, I really love this game..."
Doesn't run on any of my devices. Support is non-existent.
Pay to be disappointed...
"Oh dear sweet Umu, save me from the gacha."
Whenever it would open it would ask which email app I wanted to use to complete the action. Not sure but a game like this shouldn't need my email for anything... hope everyone else has better luck with it.
I love this game. It is very addictive and one of my faves. I'm a huge fan of the Fate series so I knew I'd love it
It just ropes you in.
Localization is improving and the game is keeping pace with a good update schedule. Very fun.
Best game I have played in years! Loved the anime and this storyline is totally addicting. Love all the new characters. I just hope there is no level cap cause I want to play indefinitely!!!
Many quartz spent never got my favorite character..
It's a fun game but it needs an auto battle function.
It's a big time killer. I love finding all new servants and getting stronger.
"Well it was fun , but had to go through the trouble of using vpn and restarting to get the app to play ( was gonna cash ) its fun over all and i hope you would expand to singapore soon"
Expensive saint quartz
"Wouldn't even work, downloaded the app and tried to run it. Kept getting an email message."
The gameplay is a bit slow and simple. Not bad but not great.
A nice and simple game to play with a cool story to boot!
"Gacha is bad Civilization, Not enough Lolis are in the game yet even though We have five already.  Saber is still forcibly the most popular character despite being bland, but most will get past that fact."
"I love this game, its fun and addictive especially for someone who loves the Fate series. My only 2 problems are once you hit level 100 ap starts becoming an issue unless you have a lot of golden apples saved or you're willing to spend quartz (&if you're a f2p player then golden apples will be your best friend so save them). Also this game has sh‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢y gacha so good luck to you"
It awesome it good but please nake karan event come out
"Fun, with great writing and awsome events, but alittle repetitive."
"Addictive, fun, gacha is mean tho"
I love the concept of fate and am a horrible gambler so pretty good.
Fun game. Clever writing. Cute waifus. ABYSMAL DRAW RATES. Don't waste your money on this game.
Just fun and addicting
I absolutely love this game. I play it any chance I can get. I think I have a problem...
"I love this game. Fun, easy control, great dialogue and choice making. Thank you for a great game that's easy to get addicted to."
Great Game From A Great Franchise.
You should a a volume button
200+ days still dnt hv SSR :)))
Too Much salt in this game
"Would like a few more scenes for a few of the events,but it's still very interesting to play."
"I'm just going to quote someone... ""Hey, That's Hell You're Walking Into""  10/10 would roll for waifu   Let's fall into hell together my friend"
"Great Game, Many beautiful characters, Good story"
BEST GAME!
Good game. Filled with old masterpieces of Type Moon and new masterpieces. Made you remember about the good old FSN with refreshing and comedic stories and events. Give plenty free quartzes and tickets too. It just needs more 1‚òÜ and 2‚òÜ servants IMO. Warning: the summon rate is damn crazy low. 1% for 5‚òÜ servant. Dont broke yourself.
"I rolled Moedred, I'm happy."
It's good y'all
gatcha
Amazing artwork
Roll the gatcha for waifus! Fail to get waifus! Cry because no waifus! 10/10 play every day.
A journey to hell
"They used male pronouns for Goddess Atalante. It is quite criminal! . . . Other than that, the game is boring compared to the Japanese version. It's still good, gameplay wise, and the music is stellar. It won't get more stars because of everything it has going for it. Criminal I say, criminal!"
Hope that this game would be a bit more faster ^^ as FGO2 is already coming to the JP
"The only thing killing this game is the gacha rates.   Oh, you love yourself some Nero bride or Orion?  Oh, well here are 3 Medusa's and a couple Spartacus's.  Oh, you grinded a ton of Saint Quartz and plan on doing a couple of x10 summons?  Oh, well here are some craft essences for You! Look at you go! That Robin Hood is looking extra mean!  The rates are so bad that I've contemplated not playing all together. Luckily, the stories pretty good and so is the gameplay."
"Really good game, but is for type moon fans only."
"Really needs to be fixed in multiple ways.  Game over isn't bad but god...rates are horrible, they should really lower the rates for Craft Essence and bring up the 5* and 4* star rates for servants just a little bit."
"I downloaded the apk quite some time ago before the US release, I was a fan then, I'm still a fan now ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
Oh god
This game is so amazing that I even stop playing some of my other games I have ‚ò∫üëçüèΩüíñ
"You'll want to invest time and effort. A rollercoaster of emotions. Its not a game, its an experience"
Game will not open on my galaxy s8+
Gachaaaaaaaa
"After a couple minutes of playing the game on my phone, it either freezes up or kicks me off the game during battle. I will give you five stars if you fix this problem. Overall it is an amazing game to play."
ultimate fate waifu collector?
And you have to use a password system to get your character servants from the past one .  I give it five stars. But I feel like the drop rates are bugged. Yeah the drop rates are not good.  But it's still fun. Just don't put money into the game. I see that as a waste. For drops.
Add honor phone
"It's a fun game, but is a huge $ pit with a total of 20 5* characters almost and almost as many 4*. With few to no new ones coming to game but in rare Hatchers. And they are same but different looks"
The game itself is OK but... Gacha rates for summons are ridiculous. There's no multiplier ever to boost rates and you'll always have that 1% chance at getting a 5 star. This also includes limited time units which is even more ridiculous to have a rate so low with no multiplier. I understand the money grab aspect of all gacha games but to go through a game not having the hero you really want makes for a less enjoyable gaming experience.
Bless this game
Won't open for me. Just sends me to a screen with an error code.
Game would be better if rate is up its always a lie
I'm a huge fan of the Fate Series and I tried for two days and I give up on it because I got an email because saying that they were trying to fix it and it still doesn't work
"I got better animations out of runeacape. Faster log in too. Also standard, ""I cant beleive its not gambling."" The ""game"" (freemium) gave me a real sense of pride and accomplishment. You could at least have had a good story but ir just wasnt. Just a waste of my time."
I love the game and the storyline but........I have the worst luck at the summoning ü§ó
They fixed my bugs with the update easy 5 star
If I could actually launch the game it would be nice. This is on the Samsung Galaxy S8+
"While the game is fun and with a good story to follow, the amount you have to grind in this game just for drops to either upgrade abilities or ascend servants is a bit insane. However, I believe a ""Auto Mode"" would perhaps solve this issue greatly. Perhaps making it where you can only Auto a mission if it has been completed once before, it wouldn't matter to much how efficient the auto AI is, just there being one that would automatically select cards at random, prioritizing Noble Phantasm cards would be great."
"Can't even play it on a samsung s7 edge. Says I can't open it under my environment l, whatever that means."
Fun for any Type-Moon fan
"It's a great game to pick up if you are a fan of the series. You can play without paying anything with the events giving you items for your stamina, but you can also earn the quartz currency through progressing in the singularities and, again, those events. It's a slow start up, but once you get through its beginning stages you will see how things pick up."
It's  cool
The game is only ok.  The gameplay is not very strategic and the load times are insanely long.  The load times really kill this game for me.
only game i played where i switched phoned and lost all my data.. theres no record of my account so all the money i spent to support the game was for nothing.
"A little disappointing when you don't get what you roll for, but still a great game"
Simply amazing
Low rates but you don't need five star units to clear content.
Absolutely love it.
"This game has horrible RNG summons, some of which include cards not the actual unit or character to add to your party. Even if you are able to summon a good unit you will spend large amounts of time grinding for materials that rarely ever show up even if they are common materials, which makes it extremely difficult to progress in the game. Fate go needs some serious changes to the RNG."
"App didn't work well, kept freezing."
"I can't play the game, it keeps force closing before the game actually starts"
It sacks
Isnt playable in my enviroment.  Why?
"Really wish this gave had the ability to restore your profile after you uninstall and reinstall. Maybe like a login? It sucks. I was going to come back to this game, but I'm sure as hell not playing through it all again to get back to where I was. It's too bad. Also the sprites are pretty bad."
Its so good you gonna melt!
"Overall the gameplay, graphics, controls and story are good. You might ask then why such a low rating? The answer is simply tjat the people who run the game are ridiculously money hungry. Even for a mobile game these people have basically put themselves on par with EA.  The premium currency is ""saint quartz"" which you can earn in game with a catch. It differentiates between paid and free saint quartz and certain events only allow for paid.  It costs 3 quartz for a summon or 30 for a 10 summon which guarantees a 4 star but that is more likely to be a craft essence than a servant.  Just for reference they sell 1 quartz for a dollar, 4+1bonus for $3.99, 12+4bonus for $11.99, 25+11bonus for $23.99, 42+23bonus for $39.99 and 86+54bonus for $79.99.  Now these prices are higb and the tock package gives you almost 5 10x summons. These summons, however, still end up with a 4% chance of a 5 star craft essence and a very low 1% 5 star servant summon. The quartz is slow to come in via the normal game and the events are quite honestly stingy. (The latest is 5 days of events with 5 quartz per day for login so not even enough for a 10x summon)  Basically the publisher/developer has a high price, low drop rates and hard to generate quartz for free. This makes for bad marketing and gameplay. If the quartz is expensive and hard to get alot of free then increase drop rates. If not droo rates increase free gains of quartz and lower the prices of quartz by at least about 50%. (Lower prices mean more sales to make up for lost profit)  All in all since you ha e to engage with this system to get decent servants is why I gave my lengthy review and my low score."
"Outstanding game for those who aren't looking for an idle one. You have to pay attention to the battles, but combat is fun and fluid, visuals and voice acting are top-notch, and systems are fair."
Very enjoyable
"Time consuming, glad there's no PvP keep it up."
"The game is good, even if it's 2 years behind JP version. For people complaining about no PvP, imagine getting rekt by a whale with an NP5 Gilgamesh with kaleidoscope equipped. Why would you even consider that possibility?"
Finally! Whatever they did to fix that frozen black screen worked! I'm able to play it now! I been playing for a couple of weeks. I'm worried about what will happen when I complete all of the singularity's. What can I do to grind for Saint Quartz's? Unless they have special missions after I complete the singularity's/free missions?
"Great story and characters! The gacha system system is rough at times, but I've managed to get half of the rate SSR servants I've tried for. Always something to do and a constant stream of content. Highly recommended!"
"Bruh, the graphics are amazing, character cute, story line perfectüëå,gameplay same GOOD so far everything about this game is wonderful, only one thing put different background that's all. But I love it.üëåüëåüëå"
This game will not start I press the app and it does not launch
Money blood suckers. Rate sucks for pulling characters. Don't bother with the game.
games grate just wish that it was easy to get 5 star units
"Great game, very well done!"
"Amazing game, though sometimes the graphics can get a bit sluggish."
Fix the damn game it work in 4 of my devices
yay
I love cheesecake  Do you know de way
Love this game! Amazing if they did a full metal alchemist version
"It's a fun and addicting game, however it is not for the faint of heart this game is how gambling addicts are born. It's fun but take heed."
Won't open tried to open email or PayPal
Can't even start the game. What trash.
A really fun game in my opinion. I just wish the chances of getting a 5-star was higher.
I'm sure this game is great if it would actually work. For whatever reason it refuses to load on a stock Galaxy S7 claiming that its not supported. On top of that i also cant get it to connect to the server on a Galaxy Tab A running strictly on wifi.
Rate up is a lie!
"Amazing game with a great story, and the lack of PvP modes means other players whaling isn't gonna ruin anything. Love it."
Specifically designed not to launch if your phone has any developer options or root enabled. Don't support vile businesses like this.
"I have a new Iview Suprapad 7 inch tablet.  Every time I try to play the game it locks up on the title screen and when I am able to play, it locks up on one of the visual novel parts.  Please fix this game."
definitely my favorite mobile game‚ù§
Lel gud gam XDXDDXDdd
Can't play the game due to crashing every load screen wasted my time trying to figure this out all day thanks
"I've tried to install but only let's me send email to tech support saying there's an issue. I would love to play, but I've never been contacted back."
"History, mythos, legends, waifus ((œÜ(Ôø£„ÉºÔø£  )"
I usually stop playing games like this after a week but the story is so interesting I mostly just keep playing because of it . The grinding for resources can get long but it's not bad and the battle system is easy to use.
It's an alright game. The battle system could be more interactive. I'm thinking more like a summoner war battle system. The leveling of the spirits is messed up too. They should get experience after each battle not just when u enhance them.
Cool but u should try to make it easier to level up
"Honesty, the game is alright. The story and plot are pretty well written, especially considering that it's a mobile game. The gameplay is certainly no Fire Emblem or Blazblue or Brave Frontier or Grandblue Fantasy , but it's not bad,  per say, just gets repetitive after a while. Has more depth than most other mobile games.  Story is given more effort as well."
I would love to see some crossovers or more events.
The game is great but the summoning isn't  good the chance at getting 4 or 5 stars are to low for my liking farming takes forever but over all its a great game
"Screenshot your Master's information! Including Transfer code, etc. And ur Main Party members!! Very important incase u switch phones or reinstall the app! It does not allow u to access ur account via log in. If u lose the app u lose all your progress if u do not lrovide this above information exactly correct to the support desk. Very frustrating. As great as the game is, this lead me to a 2 star review because now I have to start all over, after a decent amount lf grinding ingame I did."
too expensive to get heroes and to make matters worse the leveling system is beyond stupid
"Don't know anything about it. Apparently, it can't be played on a Galaxy S8 with Oreo."
The game is awesome but I just wanted to know how do I recover my data on it keep trying to start me all the way over
"Mainly for fans of the Fate/ series. Very addictive. Story is great, especially for a mobile game. Gameplay is fun and very forgiving. The gacha is not forgiving, and will break you and your will, if you allow it to."
It's a great game to play
You don't have already be a fan of the Fate series to enjoy this game. It's very fun and well made. Very addictive as well. Probably the best mobile game I've ever played
"I've waited two years for this game. Been playing everyday since the NA for the release, just getting around to giving it the credit it deserves."
BEST FATE GAME EVER!  KEEP UP THE GOOD-WORK!  üëç
"I would really like to know why this game won't open with my s7 edge. I used to be able to run it on my note 4, but it doesn't work at all with this phone. What gives?"
This game is absolute trash it just wants your money or 65 days consecutive of your time.
I like it well enough but it's slow on animations and servant intros
The game is for those who are invested in the Fate Series and will take the time to do some soul searching when they spend money and don't get the servants they want. It's a great game and looking forward to it's advancements to JP version.
I  love it but I can't get back on it can you get me my transfer number so I can delete and download it again
"Too little Chinese servants, and too much gender bending"
Deleted the app by accident and re  downloaded it and it didn't save any of my data or progress I worked had for
Game is great but the amount of essences you pull instead of units is frustrating seems like you need to spend alot of money to even get decent units let alone a 5 star increased drop rates don't seem to increase anything of those unit drop rates
Super addictive and can't wait for more servants from all the stories and sagas of the fate titles.
Good game for Fate fans but not a very good f2p game. Caters to pay to play players more than f2p players.
I don't even know why i still playing this
Its a relly good game yhe story is good and i like its characters
"Just downloaded the game a few days ago, but I'm already unsure about it. I know it's a newer game, and hopefully they're still adding to it, but so far it's a little boring and repetitive. I'm a fan of the anime, so seeing the characters and the art is fun. However, the jerky battle camera that is constantly twitching around as you attach gives me a headache, the endless dialogue and cutscenes are very boring and end up getting skipped and the fact that once you bring up your attack card choices you can't go back to the last screen to activate abilities you forgot is dumb. Overall it feels like a poorly-made flash game that needs a lot of work, but it DOES have potential if they can add more content and focus more on the experience/gameplay and less on the heady story."
The game is so fun to play
"Polished graphics and loaded with events. Consistently updated. Overall, I'm enjoying the game. However, the gacha has very low rates of getting the 5 star characters."
This game is Amazing And its even better if you've seen the Anime
You need to update this game because it's not working. It almost crashed my phone by just showing me a white screen and also it keeps sending me to an error message. Please have an update for this game so it can work on all devices.
Really like playing the game.
"I love your game in general. It has all the things I was looking for in a mobile game. But after sometime in game I could be doing a story segment, or before a battle, during it or after I get booted from the app. Please fix that please because its a great app and ill give 5 stars afterwards when fixed."
One of the best games I ever played
"You should put in a back button option for when you hit attack, because I forget all the time to use my card skill and sometimes it's a killer haha just that option would be nice I think"
This game it's one of my favorite so far as a fan of the fate series
This is a good game for fate fan
"It's a good looking and fun game, but disappoint that even if you spend more than 80 dollars you don't get nothing good, and less the good servants, you need to spend much more or have the devil's lucky"
Its very well made my only f word problem is that I have an older account I forgot my transfer number and I have no backup so basically I have to start a new please let us use Google play I'm begging you
I love the story it has going and the gameplay is entertaining
Badass. A must play
The story is good but the game is not so balanced in terms of character skills.
Pretty decent for what its worth
Pretty Decent
I always wanted to get in to this series
Great game for fans of the fate series!
I just wanna play mebg
The game is not bad it's self I enjoy playing as some of the fate  characters plus some of the personality adds a good touch grant there are some bugs but if you look past it's a good game
Aniplex one of my favorite anime productions next to mad house
Very fun and addicting game! Definately the best mobile game app out there!
"Everything is fine except for the bs summon system, very unforgiving and readily inaccessible. Done the draws so many times, but time and time again, nothing decent. Also, absolute bottom of the barrel drop rates, good luck trying to get far with these terrible drops. If it wasn't for these annoying problems, this would be a solid mobile game, but as typical gacha system bullsh*t, which this one being worse than others, greatly hampers the overall experience."
I can't play it. It says I can install it but it won't work in my environment? Edit: I still can't play for some stupid reason. Please fix this.
Decent gacha game but the rate of getting the much needed 5 star characters is a measly 1%. They're generous with the premium currency but not enough to offset the possibilities of getting 5 star characters.
Can't play on LG g5
It keeps crashing
The game was great and then my phone did an update. Now I cannot do anything. It loads and is locked on a screen to battle with the tap instructions but no party members except Mash and I cannot leave that screen.
Should have multiplayer mode maybe even a Co-op mode mhm...
I cant play it on my phone i have the note 8
EU or possibly just a UK release please!
love the anime
"Win I frst play fate/go and get a free critter i like it so win I got to the Romans age my phone got broken I got it replace with a new phone but my save date was gon and I was sad and now I can't play it no more because of a monfushin to the game so I uninstall it 2 now and I need help to play it again and I hope my fiels is still there so can you please fix this problem and have a wonderful day. Now I lost my 2nd save files and I am pisst off that I lost 2 ceriters nobu nogu oda and mareycrismu saeti artery pundrago on my frst save filed was liley and jon,d,arck so can you please give tham back to me  I work so hard to get those 4 grlis and have them take in a way so can you please give them back and please put in a cloud save on so no one will loss everything no more and thank you for making a good mobile phone game and I hope that there will be more stuff to do."
I've been a fan of the fate franchise since it first came out.  I loved the anime and I love fate go!
"My goodness this game is so fun. I practically log in everyday. The only problem with the game is that it will randomly crash on me. Despite that, I would this play this game because I like Fate so much."
This is awesome
I could not even try it out the load times are stupid way two long not gunna wait 2-3 min for one thing to load
üóùÔ∏èüóùÔ∏è RATE UP IS A LIE üóùÔ∏èüóùÔ∏è
"""Unique NA experience"" Butchering events, less apologems, bad PR and localization (blackbeard). JP is laughing at us."
"I adore the fate series, it's my favorite anime series, as well as having some really fun video games like fate/extra, and fate/extella. But this game feels like a mess, the fighting is good, coherent and easy to string strong combos, but the story is worse then the movie it's based off of. I don't know if it's because it's to slow, or to cut up, but I don't like the way it's presented. Don't get me started on summoning, it's a joke, it makes dokkan battle look good. Summon rates are laughable, along with not knowing if you got a servant or mage essence, it feels cheap, the summon animation also feels that way. So for people like me, who are more collectors, then players, give it a pass."
I luv the anime but this took it to a whole new level!
If you're a fan of the fate series. This is a must play.
Fun scenario ruined by pointless unrewarding and repetitive gameplay.   Progression system also is very bad. Easy to sink so many hours and feel absolutely abysmall growth.
R.I.P no more free quartz that sucks I wanted to refill for mordred to late...
"I love playing them game but after clearing the chapters, it gets borning for a bit and the gach system sucks. If a new servant has a high rate to get, it doesn't matter cause you won't be able to get them, you'll just get lower star servants."
Is there a glitch or something I can't play it without the game loading all the time Also it sent me back to the homepage
Game play a lot better than I thought it would be
"Ini Game Panteq Sangad Lah, W Udah Sangean Sama Tante Scath Eh Malah Dikasih Karna, Wahai DW Berikan Gw SQ Lageee, Panteq Kaw, Ini Dick Gw Gak Tahan Lagi, Mau Coly Pake Scath"
I like  the tv show
"Won't even open, force closes as soon as I click on the app."
Got my account back after some confusion. This app is amazing! I love the character designs and the game mechanics are really good.
Pretty good.
Won't launch with USB debugging enabled.
"Game will not launch on my galaxy tab a, so I'm unable to play it."
A decent game with horrible gacha rates. Thankfully the game is a single player story focused experience and all story content is easy enough that the top of the line characters aren't needed.
"My salt for the Gacha is immense, but my love for the game is much more"
"Get this game!, the gatcha summoning can be harsh but this game earns everything"
Get this game
"Good game, good graphics, i stress this, it is a very fun game. However it's drop rates are just not consumer friendly. Spent over $200 have not done anything"
I gave you fifty bucks for a four star lancer you gave me craft essences
Just as addicting as the fate series.
"Gameplay and graphics are great, only complaint is that I easily spent more than a $100 worth of Saint Quartz (All earned in game) for a 4 STAR SSR with a DROP RATE UP and I still failed to get her. And to add insult to injurtly I only got 1 viable craft essance in all those rolls. GG"
"the update is sux, it won't connect to the server even my phone is in the best signal fudk"
I am the bone of my salt
Its great but the download process is long
Legendary
Love the game . Very addictive.. still waiting for the new quest update
Only game were I can play as a girl and kiss Marie Antoinette. 10/10 Would gay again.
Constant crashes ruin the game experience. Reinstalling does nothing because you lose all data. Stay clear from this cash grab.
I love it.
Can't get passed the tutorial. Game shows only a white screen when you're instructed to use a noble phantasm.
"Downloaded and installed, only thing I can do with this app is send error emails."
"can't even open it, but i am able to play line fate grand order from korean playstore"
Satisfying gacha game.
Keep losing connecting when summoning which causes me to lose quartz
Love it I guess love it
"Shameless broken system that attempts to rely on fans of the series to sell overpriced virtual currency so you have a chance of getting your favourite character.  They could learn from Bungou Stray Dogs new game which has a much better formula, more skilled gameplay and better fan service."
I love this game it's awsome. I hope u make a 2nd version of this game
Game does not run on One Plus One. It continuously gives an error 61 and does not open. The solution is extremely contrived and requires ROM editing. Too bad.
"One of the few mobile games that you play for the story. All fans of Fate should be playing this, even though the gatcha rates are harsh compared to games like FEH."
It didn't even work on my tablet!
"Game is cool and all, but the same night I downloaded it, server issues happened and can't even log in for days now."
The Gacha is rigged; and the combat gets tedious. The story and characters are decent
i been waiting for this game like 3 years
Connection wouldn't connect even with 3 bars
"I love this game so much, it gives more for when the series is not continuing, you can spend most of the time playing this game. If you watched the series then welcome fellow mate. Graphics are amazing, there is so much t this game then what you could assume. Also make sure to stay up to date with the creators of this series Kinoko Nasu & Kristi Reed ^-^"
Its a great game to play. Bad pulls but dont sweat it! Keep your quartz and use it for something useful. U can evolve your units and upgrade stars too so just dont play for the draws. Play it like a game you want finish.
Tamamo for life
"Incredible! If you're a fan of the Fate series,this is a must play. Even if you aren't, the visuals and the sound are top tier work and it would not be wise to miss out on such a masterpiece!"
"A lot more intricate than I first thought, great game"
A huge fate fan been having fun even when I have to grind the only thing I wish the.drop rates for asend items were higher other then that I love this game
I always like the fate series so I'm glad they brought this over to North America
"I really  like  this  game,  but for some reason since  the latest  update my game has been unable to open please help me"
I am a filthy casual when it comes to games but this has me hooked. Probably the best mobage i've ever played
I liked this game a lot but now it says it is down until further notice. Is there going to be a timeframe?
Great game specially if you've watched/are watching the amazing anime
Always been a fan of the fate series. I usually get bored of games quick but every day I find myself playing this game! It's so good and addicting! Plus I get to have some of my favorite servants! The only downside is it's a very small chance of getting a 5 star servant
Thank you fixing the bug. Thank you so much
"beautiful animations and very enticing plotline, highly recommended to any Type-Moon fans or anime fans in general"
Best game ever!
Good across the board.
Love the fate series
I have been playing this game for a little over a month now and it is still very engaging and fun. The storyline is amazing and the artwork put into this game is magnificent.
Reeeee
Addictive. Makes you a whale
"LOVE THE FATE SERIES! This Game is neat, and allows you to see your favorite characters in extended story, and (if your very lucky) the 1% chance gotcha will afford you a 5 star fan fave servant during special events. I got my Hubby Archer Emiya so I'm good lol üòç   **I have an Archer X Reader Fan-fic called Fate/Reckoning on Wattpad if anyone is interested (shameless advertising).**    The game would have gotten 5 stars if it were a tad more reasonable with fan-fave character recruitment. I get it though, gotta make that $$$ and all. üòì But honestly my hopes and dreams can only be shattered so many times by a phone game. Please look into ramping up the gatcha drop rate to maybe 5% or 10% for major characters, something...ANYTHING more than 1%???"
"This game is so damn good, can't stop playing it and those visuals, ufff, beautiful."
Beep
"The gatcha is a little bit unrighteous , you rarely get what you want but the game still keeps you entertained. Fun for spending time and relaxing."
My old phone died on me and so I had to get a new phone. Re-downloaded this game and it is asking for a code and password to do a data transfer.... How can I get this info if my old phone is dead?
"Beautiful and extremely fun, has a lot of wit and humour in the writing. I absolutely love playing! I just wish my luck was better with the gacha pulls..."
"I've sunk about 6 months, maybe, into this game. I love it to no end. It's actually had me playing more on my phone than console"
"The game play held a suprising amount of depth compaired to its competitors, yet is simple enough to get into. There are some balancing questions id have for the devs but the benefit to this game is that its entirely possible to be pure f2p.  For a free game it gets a ton of updates and a consistent stream of new content, almost too much at a time to be honest. If youre a fan of the franchise and are looking to try it out, i would highly recommend it."
"Having lots of fun with this game, probably accentuated by my being a big Type-Moon fan. If I had to list a downside, it'd be the Gacha rates - it isn't unusual to save up for months for a specific event summon and then not get what you were aiming for :') But it's still an awesome game and the only mobile game I play nowadays. &lt;3"
Bit behind Japanese version but it'll get there. Translation iffy at points but improving. Great game.
It's good if you're a fate/ series fans
Waifu wars. Fate edition. What more do you want?
"Been trying to play for long time, but since this new update the game just black screen just after downloading the whole data thing. It's annoying, the background music still plays but the game remains black screen please fix this So we can enjoy it. For now it's 1 star."
"I loved the gameplay and the story.  My biggest 3 complaints are:  1. Dialogue - would like an option to show it instantaneously. Currently it's too annoying even at the fastest setting. 2. Not much content - I completed the main storyline in about 3 days. Honestly, this launched in the West only a month ago, so I don't expect much yet. 3. Lack of social features - the only thing there is is support characters. I'd like to see at least a messaging system and PvP."
Fan of fate and love this game
A Type Moon fan must have mobile app!
"If you are a Typemoon fan, this is the game for you."
THICC
Its great love the story
Didn't let me play the game
After downloading the game don't open screen turns black mayb if u fix will give good rating
Brand new Google pixel 2 and it can't run this game??
Adicting!
"I absolutely love this game. Truly. I fell in love with the FATE series and waited, seemingly, forever for this mobile game to be localized... Now here I sit unable to play for some unknown reason with support leaving me to rot. No response from them in weeks...."
"BS App, nothing New, just another  bunch of hungry fks after your money. Too bad i dnt kno thm in rl lif.   P.s. Drop rate up is a scam"
"Can't even play. Game launches and downloads extra file, but then freezes."
I like it so far but won't give me the santa alter
Amazing game I love fgo
"keep crashing whenever starting a main story mission, hardly progress through main quest. I don't have a problem with daily and free quest."
The story Mission is fix for now but I can't log on now what is going on is it me the only have all this problem help plz plz plz I'm so done for week this game just never work for me I loss my hope bet
"Had uninstalled the game,spent hella money on it and now i cant get any of my stuff back..great job guys good game. Fix your stuff :/"
"I WAS excited to play this game... If I could even get past the main ""Tap the Screen"" screen. However, after I tapped the screen it brought me to a black screen that would remain black for a while until finally a little box popped up saying ""Fate_GO isn't responding. Do you wish to close it?"" So I closed and I retried starting the game again and again and again until I finally uninstalled it."
Can't even play it screen stays black after tapping to start
5 thousand stars
Love it... But the gacha... the gacha
"While fun on a mechanical level, the game suffers massively on progression and acquiring new Servants. Events that boost chances will not help you. Getting crystals to roll for more things is tedious and, more than likely, completely fruitless. It did keep me engaged for a while but ultimately, it's just an exercise in frustration."
"Game crashes on title screen. Will not load anymore. This is mentioned on multiple reviews. Dont give any money until you're sure you wont get locked out, since there's no account recovery options. A shame, because the game seemed interesting, when I could log in."
I played this before when it first came out and it was great. It was different from most gacha games out there. I let it go because of the grind. I decided it give it another try but now after installing I cannot get past the start screen. It just goes blank. It looks like a lot of people are having this issue. Maybe once this company gets it together I'll try again and change my review.
I love this game but everytime I start it I get a black screen please fix
"A good game with addictive gameplay, beautifully voiced characters, music. BUT, do not play this unless u are prepared for: -1. absurd amount of grinding, even a common monster drop required over 5 runs to get even 1 drop -2. Very long stamina recover time, 5 mins for 1 while u will need 10 for easiest stage and 40 for the hardest -3. Being milk for cash, 1$ for 1 quartz, 3 quartz for each pull, each week u can get 2 free quartzs if finish weekly quests -4. There is no Google/Facebook connect so u can only play on 1 device and each time u change it, u will need to use in-game transfer to continue playing. In short, only play this game if u have lots of free time, rich or use 1 device for long time."
"I've downloaded 9 times and it won't run ,it starts then kicks me"
"Tried installing it a few months ago and crashed on launch. Tried again now, crashed. This is hilariously ridiculous since I have a very good phone."
It's lit!!!
"Addicting game, but be warned if you come in hoping for a specifc servant be prepared for salt. Also beware that this game has tons of grinding."
Is very good game
"I enjoy this game a lot. The research done behind the various historical characters is very well done yet each character has their own twists and turns that'll make them seem like completely new characters even if you're familiar with their story. The artwork is just amazing, nothing else to say about it. I could talk about the gameplay but I think everyone should try it themselves and form their opinions about it -- I myself really like it."
"Thank you, now I can play it!"
I just like it
"Love the game so far, nice character designs, OST, graphics, and the characters, as well as the story. But currently, I'm unable to continue past the first mission at the second section of the second order. Please fix this &gt;&lt;"
"Aniplex, please try being more consistent.  Every damn time you release an event, it's got formatting error, missing words, and typos.  You already have awful humor. The whole altria deal wasn't bad first but it became annoying once I touched Extella.  How the hell can you celebrate it's release without remaining consistent to the t?  I'm loving FGO, but damn... It gets annoying."
App sucks say it's not playable in my playing environment. It wouldn't even open. And I was looking forward to playing too. So blownüòí
Cant even play the game anymore it just keeps on chrashing
like crack.
This is awesome üçîüçîüçï
Richard
Might be a decent game if it would work.
App is constantly crashing when I try to start missions
The game never went pass the first touch screen Maybe you guys didn't make it compatible with Androids? Motorola Droid Maxx 2
I would give a better rating if they had a way to link acct to an email or google acct the migrate code thing caused me to loose my firzt profile cause the phone i had broke
This game keeps black screening but im sure its a good game this review would be better if i could actually have a chance to play it even for an hour
The game keeps black screening on load in. :/
I would give it a better score if I could actually play it but every time I try to play it I just get a black screen
Would not load on my device which has no problem with other large games. I was very psyched for this game and disappointed I can't play it.
After I uninstalled I can't play again
Im so glad this is a game
Love the game but y'all need to put it in English too
Game is great and has certainly been an entertaining game on the go. Now if only they could fix the game up a bit more to prevent crashing but that may be my phone's hardware
"Won't open at all. I have a Nexus 6P, shows up on the market as supported, installs, the client starts but it shuts me out..."
"üò≠üò§ Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.... All this game does is CRASH MY DEVICE.   EEEERRRRRR! Login... Crash. Access the menu... Crash. Change the formation... Crash. Pick a fight... Crash. Finish a battle... Crash. Summon stuff... Crash as soon as a servant talks. Not just the simple ""this app is not responding"" crash either I mean total complete reboot. üò§üò≠"
Can't get passed the load screen when you first open the app. (On the screen where it allows you to data ttansfer). Played it before and I loved it but I'm unable to play it now and it's been that way for awhile now
It's a very great game if you don't mind investing time into it.
Lan√ßa no Brasil tamb√©m poh
Loved it until it stopped working.  Freezes on a black screen after the main menu.
Jame gud
I need help. My game crashes everytime I try to play the 3rd mission of the tutorial in Fuyuki city.
"Fun game when I got to play it but now I can't get it to start, it keeps freezing after the home page."
Love the game just wish it would open past the title since the last update.
"Used to love this ane, but it has become unplayable due to tbe game hard crashing everytime i tru to play the mission i need to advance"
A great game with plenty of events and expanding story.  Any fate fan should have this
Amazing grand order is the best mobile game.
Very addictive anime game with great characters!
"Really like the game and how the control are but i uninstall the app cause it was eating up my storage ,but i try to reinstall the app but as soon as i log in to the game its turn black and freeze and says its not responding.if you can fix this problem that be great"
OMFG MY FAVORITE ANIMU SERIES HAS A GAME
I absolutely love it!
Very addicting and will someday take all my money!
"One star until you fix the Android version. I'll rate it when I can actually play it, thanks."
"I loved playing this game. However,  one day I had to uninstall it to save space on my phone. Anyway, after I had enough space to download it again, the game would not allow me to play. It would go through the downloading screen and everything, but the ""Touch Screen"" part would be as far as I could go. When I touch my screen to start the app, it goes black. I can hear the music but the screen remains black, and after a while, it says ""Stopped Responding"". I can no longer play FGO. I also tried playing on my tablet, but I had the same issue despite never having installed it there before. Note: Both of my devices are android, and I have noticed that many others on android devices have the same issue."
"Waited a long time was definitely worth the wait!  Edit: singularity six, okeanos is extremely ram heavy as it turns out and so you may have to, on older or cheaper devices, tweak what programs you allow to run in the back ground while playing if that fails to free up enough ram for you ""like it did me here"" you can lower the amount of ram the game demands by adjusting your team comp I dropped scathach and one other servant and was able to play out the rest of okeanos no problem. Remember that this game over all is ram heavy at a minimum requirement of 1.1 gigs before investing money in it. But aside from that this game Is still my favorite game out now without exception."
I've been having this game for awhile but I've come across a problem where when I tap start quest for one of the story quest it just freezes the game tells me it's not responding so I made myself a data transfer code then tried uninstalling it but when I reinstalled the game and agreed to the terms it just takes me to a black screen please help
No longer works on 8.1.0 Oreo for Pixel 2.
Even after that update my game still won't open on my Android. I'm missing the event because my game keeps crashing after the title screen.
"The story is infuriating. Being forced to ask for help from other players is ridiculous. If your already a fan, you will like it. But if not, avoid."
Love the Fate series in general so this is just too awesome
A great game.
I like it but the game constantly crashes or has loading issues it got really annoying
Just pray to the gacha gods every night and you'll be fine. Regardless we all know why we play this game. For our gender bent waifus
1.8.1 works with Android 8.1 now
Awesome time burn coupled with a good system to earn quartz so you can unlock new servants. Highly recommend!
"I really do love this game, but here is the only problem, anytime I try to play the second singularity story missions. The game will freeze and then I have to wait. When is that problem going to be solved??"
"Previous versions ran great. But unfortunately on 8.1 Oreo it is not running. So for all current Pixel users that have not updated to 8.1, don't update unless you want to continue playing before they push updates for 8.1 Oreo."
"I love this game, but I need help! KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST ANDROID UPDATES! This is the only game I've ever played that crashes if my operating system is too new. Using a Google Pixel."
"great game, best one i have on my phone by far"
"Honestly, this is the single most money hungry, vindictive ""game"" I have ever played."
Game sucks an doesn't fully load
Cooly
Won't load
Wont start on my old Nexus 4..
"While most newcomers will have some getting used to in terms of Type Moon lore, the game is just too fun to ignore. And with such a wide selection of Servants to choose from, which is nowhere close to what we'll inevitably see, you're guaranteed to find characters that you will enjoy immensely."
Really wish I could keep playing this! Pixel 2 had a system update and now the only app I get locked out of is Fate! Why is this not a more flexible app?
Updated phone (pixel 2 XL) to Android 8.1 directly from Google and now this game won't run.  Support has provided nothing but a response that the OS isn't supported.
The game auto sends an email saying I can't play...please help
Amazing title for fans of type moon or just anime in general. Just remember... Rate up is a lie!
I couldn't play because it would freeze before anything happened
Probably would have liked it if i would have been able to play... The game freezes at a black screen after the start screen... Fix this and ill change my answers.
Need to add the ability to split attacks.  But otherwise it is a good game.
Waifu simulator. That's all.
"Game won't load on my android tablet. Tablet has more than high enough specs, and used to run this game smoothly. Now it crashes when it tries to load most story sequences. Unplayable garbage for now."
I hate it because my phone won't play the game but I love the game so till they make the game playable for my phone it be a 1 star just like there servants ill give five star if some one important messages me
Nothing but black screen
please support to remix os :'(
As a Fan of Fate I love the concept of Grand order and the story is great
It with great experience to play your favorite fate series
The story and dialogue are goofy and add a lot of charm.
"Subpar gacha game, interesting stories though. The gameplay itself where you're fighting mobs is just bland. Maybe some people prefer this style more than other styles but it just looks and feels ugly."
HASHIRE SORI YO KAZE NO YOU NI TSUKIMIHARA WO PADORU PADORU
Everything about this game is amazing. The story is good and hilarious. The cimmand spell mechanic is interesting. My one criticism of this game is that the servant rates are too low and a 30 quartz pull doesn't garuntee a 4 star servant. In 5 30 quartz pulls I've gotten only 1 four star servant and have gotten 14 four star craft essences.
This is a gacha game but the kicker is that all servants are viable.
Wish it wouldn't flip out when in use sidesync which requires me to turn on debugging mode.
"Game crashes right after home screen. I think it has something to do with the newest update, please fix it. I really enjoy this game but sadly it doesn't let me play."
"I have to have developer mode on, and FGO won't work with dev mode on. This wouldn't be such a big issue, if it wasn't for the app causing my phone to constantly open new instances of gmail to email support, I literally couldn't do anything since it would keep interrupting me, couldn't even turn dev mode off, had to uninstall game. It did this with the app closed btw."
Great game right as i get past the loading of the game right after downloading it goes to a black screen. I love those types of games
Hate the the freezing and saying it's not responding
"A fairly solid game dragged down by spotty translation. Past bugs have been fixed, so the team cares enough to make things work properly."
Currently unable to get past mission 6 in fuyuki no idea why the mission loads up then stays on the black screen
Very nice title.
"Another gatcha game wrapped around pretty illustrations. The game play isnt much, the art is excellent. The store is great in some moments but mediocre overall. The rate of getting a 5 star is very low, at 1%. This means that you would have to spend thousands just to get the 5 star you are aiming. But this game is f2p friendly at least in this moment as event gives you usable 4 stars."
Couldn't even load game just crashes. üòü
Addicting if you're a fan of the series
Horrible.
Low pull rates
Best game for a phone
"Fun game, but crashes and freezes entirely too much when trying to load new scenes or any attack or Noble Phantasm graphics.  Still can't get to the third stage of ""Queen Anne's Revenge"" because the entire game freezes every time I click the ""Start Quest"" button.  Please fix this soon."
My game won't load it just goes black screen
Best fan service for fate fans imaginable
"The first time I try to start the game after downloading, it just opens my email with an error message saying the game is not playable under my playing environment. I sent the email so I'll see what happens, but that's not a good start. LG V20."
I really like the game when it works. but can't get past opening screen. and when I did couldn't get past the third mission. kept freezing
Exelent
Loved playing the game spent way too much money on it. Only to be locked out by the same issue many have had I can't get past the opening screen anymore and customer support has been so far unhelpful
Hey why did i get this [Fate/Grand Order is not playable under your playing environment. Please contact us via email then we will give you an information about the data migration to the sender's email address.] after downloading an click on game app
"I'm a dire fan of Nasu's Fate series, and this is a great new chapter! The game is fun, updates regularly, and often has fun events for players. I love it!"
Dissappointed. I thought I could download this game for my phone. After the data installs the game crashes everytime. When I restart and tap the title screen it goes black and just sits there not working at all. Fix this.
The game just just stops at the title screen not letting me log in.
I love the game only problem is after I spent money on it my stuff disappeared
The game keeps freezing after I tap the start quest button for the quest x-f figuki city other than that it's a cool game please fix this issue.
This game crashes every time I finish the cutscene for chapter 1 section 3
Waifus for laifu! Great game overall
They've improved a lot of the gameplay so far so I changed my rating.
"Played the Japanese version, and the English Version does not disappoint. Solid 10/10 from me."
I love the game! The only downside is that it's a bit too hard to obtain even respectably powered heroes...
It does the Fate series justice. I do wish Rate Up wasn't a lie.
The Game is Really Good for Hard Core Fate Fans and other anime fans alike... Just be prepared for Gatcha Hell :D
"The only mobile game that I actually feel like playing. Slow start, but satisfying later on."
Great story but Gacha is bad civilization.
Gatcha Game. Rng can be harsh.
"Im so addicted, i have 3 accounts"
"Cool game, just another money grab though. It had potential."
Great way to spend time
So Much Salt...more salt than the sea
Funny. Constant events. Well written.
I love this game because I LOOOOOOVE the franchise. And because I love the movie as well. And it's really entertaining.
Love it . I got saber :)
"I cant play it anymore. Everytime I try and log in it gives me a black screen and force closes, please fix"
"Absolutely the best mobile game out there. From the epic story to the dailies and CONSTANT free content, this game surpasses others by leaps and bounds.  The depth to the content and immense amount of events released and planned for the game show that this is more than just a money generator; there is true care in a quality port.  Some complain of heavy grinding. I have too much fun to complain, and also been blessed with an array of amazing and fun servants -- without spending a dime.  I actually paid the game some of my shekels because I'm so pleased with it."
Great game for Fate fans
So Love It
rip wallet
Love the series game is fun just really needs more free stars for summons
"White whale,  holy grail."
Really fun and addictive
Myeeeeaaaah. This is fanservice and money dump. Repetitive and tedious.  Would not recommend
"I can actually play the game, I find that entertaining."
Story : 10/10 Graphics : 8/10 Salt : &gt; FDA approved value
Was enjoyable
"Sure is fun having it ask for my account information just to tell me I can't play because I needed a custom ROM on my phone for the battery to last longer than an hour. Drink piss, Aniplex."
"It's a fun game, no doubt about that, but whenever I try to start a quest the game just freezes, it's a good game but what's the point of it being good if it can't be played."
"After installing it just crashes and tries to ""share"" something until i force close it. It never booted up on my device. I'll change my rating if this game ever works. I love the Fate series. It would be great to play this."
I have mixed feelings with this game. For one thing the gatcha system is so soul breaking and demanding on real money its infuriating. On the other hand looks great and plays well. But dont expect to get the character you want even if you pay for quartz chances are you will not get them.
It is a great game with good storyline and enjoyable gameplay. Solid 4.5/5
The story and controls are good but the RNG is horrible
"Fun, but a better roll of a daily would be nice."
"Can't  get past intital download and title screen goes to a black and blue screen.  Tried uninstall and reinstall, all other apps running perfect. Please fix"
Fate grind order. No autoplay
"The game itself is fun and easy to play. The real issue is that it is  pay to win level maximum. St quartz are everything in this game and while they do give some out each week if you don't pay money you will progress at a snails pace.    You might get 1-4 saints quartz a week for free, maybe. You can get them from doing the campaign (there is only so many quartz you can get from the campaign) but with the limited AP you end up having to bounce between the campaign, events, and daily quests. You will probably miss out on many events.   Things saints quartz do: *Resurrect everyone at full hp and noble phantasam  *refill your ap (all quests and missions cost ap to do. Ap comes back at 1 point every 5 minutes and many quests cost between 20-30 AP to do, without AP you can't do anything)  *roll for more servants and gear. In order to get more stuff you spend saints quartz or summoning tickets but tickets are not that common. 1 ticket or 3 saints quartz =1 roll.   30 saints quartz = 10 rolls (you can't use summoning tickets for the 10 roll only quartz) but with a guaranteed 4 star or better and some other benefits. In short doing the 30 quartz 10 roll gives dramatically better chances at getting something decent and with a 1% drop rate for 5 star  stuff....that increased chance is really important.  I short the game is fun but the pay to win is really dumb.  UPDATE: spent over 590 saints quartz during an event to get a servant that supposedly had an increased drop rate. That's several hundred rolls. In all of that I did not get it, I only got one random 5 star servant.  DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GAME! Drop rate is beyond terrible.  I made the mistake of putting in money and will not be doing so again. I recommend anyone thinking of playing this game does not either"
I like this game but im giving up on it because it seems to time out every time I try to log in or even restart the app so I'm on hiatus til this app fixes it errors
"Amazing game. Been a fan of the fate series for years and always hoped this game would get a NA version. Graphics are great, gameplay is fun and more interesting than a lot of gacha games. Summon rates are admittedly pretty low but unlike other gachas even the lower rarity servants can be very good. Love the game and will continue to play for a long time to come."
The game keeps crashing when I try to complete a mission on the island of wyverns in the third singularity.
"The game looks good and is overall pretty engaging with team building and combat strategy, especially if you like all of the Fate series.   However, the summoning system is really holding the game back for me. It seems it either gives you everything you want, or is soul crushingly cruel, and I personally landed on soul crushing.   I think it isn't a good sign when the recommendation online is to make new accounts until the starter currency rolls what you want (wish i knew that when starting). I'd consider spending money, but the summons are 100% up to chance, so the odds of spending $40 and getting nothing in return is just too high. It would be much better if you could just buy something and not pay for a 'chance' (1%) at something. Unfortunately, games like this are really counting on the whales to pay whatever it takes to get what they want.  Ultimately the game is playable with fodder/free units, but the way the game uses 'friends' and events to display new characters just feels bad, and seems to be capitalizing on that feeling to pressure you into paying, especially with the number of limited time characters. Considering the amount of money these pseudo gambling games make, I'm not expecting a change any time soon.  My advice: there is a lot of cool stuff here, but leave any expectations of getting premium units at the door. If you get one, count your lucky stars. The less you expect from summoning, the less disappointed you will be and the less it will hurt. You may find it easier to just buy an account with good units pre-rolled."
This game used to work for me but now it doesn't. I get pass the download and it stops responding
Great story and gameplay.
I love fate but this game really wants your money. Pls increase your drop other games at least gives you a decent chance to pull a 5* hero but 1% for you guys is down right disheartening does not matter how much you save your odds are so low you might as well not pull at all. If you want to play this game pls listen that you might be stuck with sub par servants unless your uber lucky or spend cash.
"For some reason when I try to start it up, it keeps giving me a black screen and then crashes. Idk why."
Grinding takes a while and I'm not about to pay $40 for a single 5 star guaranteed summon that's a horrible deal
"I find fgo to be a good game. I enjoy the servants and there extra stories,  the monthly events, and how much you can see went into the game.  How ever it's far from perfect. If you have a weak phone it's unplayable. I have a gallery 3 mini and it crashes when i do some gotchas, and play for more then 15 minutes.   If you have anything weaker then this, then I'm sorry to tell you this, but you can not play it. Plus the the gotcha is very unforgiving.  I wish the game will do what gbf dose and make it where you can only buy any one character you want by spending around 50 dollars each new month if you wish. Or pick one 5 star you want out of 3 like some other games will do.  And really these negatives could take out the fun for the game for some people. Not only that but this game dose feel like a very high stakes gambling game. So be careful when spending your money.  I don't care if your wife or husband servant came out. Because there is a huge possibility you might not get them after spending over 300$.  Don't get me wrong. I love the game, but know that these are some problems to a fun game. So please be careful while playing it."
Absolutely epic!!!!
For a free game the mechanics are suprisingly deep and is incredibly generous for f2p and p2p players alike.
The game looks good from the vids and pictures. i was really hoping to play this game but it not working on my phone. It just give a froze black screen after the loading screen plz fix it
I was never able to get past the loading screen. It instantly told me that the game wasn't responding no matter what I did. I was very excited to play but now it just annoys me.
Downloaded to give it a try. Wouldn't even go past the starting page before crashing. Bummer.  I was looking forward to trying it to.  üòî
"It's an ok game, I wouldn't recommend it to those who aren't a fan of the series. As far as story and gameplay/combat mechanics goes, it's very deep and well thought out. Ultimately the game is a visual novel with dungeon rpg elements. Graphics are ok but the illustrations for each servant card are pretty amazing. The game doesn't really give new players any incentive to continue playing, so if you didn't start playing at launch then you're gonna be using a support servant for quite a long time to help carry you through everything until you can get yourself a decent team of servants (rerolling for a 5* servant is a pain but worth it). Also it's a gacha game. I play one other gacha game seriously (Final Fantasy Record Keeper) and recently started another one and by far this one is thee most unforgiving, extremely low rates on 5* servants and the currency you use to summon is very difficult to come by which is why I said earlier the game doesn't give new players any incentives to continue playing. Though long term, there are login reward bonuses so you can horde the currency and summon tickets the other option is to spend real money, though I warn you the risk is high and the reward is very very low. Lastly it's fairly addicting, there is a grind for materials to level up and ascend servants which could get stale sometimes but the motivation really comes from just wanting to get that last card art for each servant.   TL;DR: Recommended for veteran or die hard Fate fans only. Though if you're a veteran or die hard, you're probably playing this already. Honestly it almost feels like the game creators went out of their way to make the game less appealing to people who are generally new to the series. GLHF."
Fantastic Fate game. Pepper thy Angus though. Mainly with salt.
I like it but since the update it keeps freezing. Plz fix.
It is so good
It's a good game but it keeps crashing on the Samsung j3 so if that gets fixed I might appreciate it even more
"Good game. Very fin and addicting. Only problem is it doesn't want to start up anymore. I've tried for a couple days now and every time it crashes after the title screen. I dont want to have to uninstall and lose my data, please fix this"
Gacha is bad otherwise it's a good game.
"I showed you my wallet, give me Scathatch."
Fun game cant stop playing and the story is good
"Was pretty hyped for this game after recently getting into the fate series but the game won't load, and my phone freezes on a black screen with music playing. I'll happily give the game another shot once they fix this issue"
Nice Just  Nice
"The combat system is not my cup of tea to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of this 1x -2x - 3x matching thing or whatever you wanna call it, an going by what games I play they were  more of a swipe or tap for attacks Which is quite enjoyable.  Example of a game which has a pleasing combat system would be Brave Frontier with a characters regular attack being a tap or swiping up, left and right for different abilities.   Overall the game is enjoyable if you love the fate series or just want a game to past the time."
CANT ACCESS THE GAME FREEZES ON MOTOROLA MOTO G
"Dont like it, wont let me play and freezes up. Game lags out and when I try to play it, the game sends me to my gmail for some strange reason"
Whenever i try to login it goes into a black screen and forces me out. Is there anyway to fix this?
Thickness squad were u at
Can't like a game if it gives me a black screen upon loading every time. And my phone can handle most games.
"Good game, but now it crashes at load screen."
I really enjoy this game. My only problem is that updating the game is a hassle.
Game is just a little too simple. I hope they add more complexity to the game.
"doesn't let me play it anymore after 3 days of playing it, it just freezes after I press start and crashes. I don't want to uninstall and lose the progress and servant's I've gotten so far. Please fix this!"
Pretty fun game. With amazing music and an entertaining story.
A historical adventure! Excellent! !
"Was never able to get the game to run after install. Really wanted to play, but after a couple months of trying after updates still couldn't get it to work. If it worked I am sure it would of been a great game."
Not supported on a pixel C tablet apparently.
"This game benefits from having no player versus player, since there is no pressure to buy your way to victory.   Silver and bronze servants are not only easy to get, but also as good as or better than gold servants for clearing story missions and doing daily and event missions.   Still want a gold servant? Almost every event includes one free gold servant, with the opportunity to get four more copies of the same. Weekly missions, logging in daily, and trading mana prisms each month will also get you the Saint Quartz and gacha tickets for summoning. So it's only a matter of time and patience, if you don't or can't spend money.   I highly recommend checking a guide or Reddit on the game before diving in.   Finally, remember that this is not pay to win; it's pay to waifu. The other angry reviews that you see of people criticizing the gacha system usually focus on the latest shiny servant and craft essences that they really WANTED, but didn't NEED.  Stay humble, get to know your bronze and silver heroes and heroines, and stick around for the gold servant give-aways. You'll have way more fun that way."
"For those who are stuck in the back screen after start, try turn off download from unknown sources. Worked like a charm for me after trying literally everything else."
"Despite what many reviews say this game is not P2W. There is no PVP, and all content can be cleared with the lowest rarity servants. It's a great game to pass the time."
Good game latest update took out chapter 9 of the 3rd singularity
So I been trying to just start the game up I been trying to actually play it but everytime I finish the downloading in the beginning and go to start playing the game crashes and I can never play. I tried uninstalling it 4 times now and it still doesn't work I just want to play the game
A game where money doesnt matter and everything is viable. Excellent for those who are starting or enjoy the fate/ series.
At first I was enjoying the game grinding oda event and I was grinding for a chance to get scatath but thanks to this last update I can't play anymore because it always crashes at the title screen  plz fix it soon cause I really want scatath
"Well designed game, I just cant get into it too much"
Hope more characters will come out asap.Really nice gameüëç.But the chance to get 5 star characters so hard like it was impossible to get.Even 4 star characters rarely to come out.Every time I try I didnt even get 4 star characters.Hope you can increase the drop rate a little.Sorry for my bad english.
Hello hoping to find a way to catch game support I was wondering about my account I had got my transfer code but forgot to screenshot my id is there amyway with the transfer code you guys can me ID back cause I havrthe transfer code remember my name and such....or a customer service part I can reach please and thank you
Ive been trying to play this but keeps givong me an error... Not playable under the circumstances.... Im on an Android phone
One day ill roll a good servant...
"The reason why I've rated it a one star is because ever since we had our last update, I am no longer able to make anymore progress in this game due to crashes; whenever I hit that start button for a map, the game freezes and it causes me to force close the game everytime. I'm using a pretty old phone and before this update it did crash quite a bit, but it was still playable,  but now, it's completely unplayable."
Instantly crashes on oneplus one
Love the game but now it freezes whenever I try to load chapter 6. Plus this is my second account. My first was lost and customer service claimed they could not reclaim it...
"With the recent update for 11-22-2017 the game keeps crashing every time I try to continue the storyline, I was planning on grinding the game to get the new 5 star summon but unfortunately I'm just gonna have to give her up because I don't have the money for quarts end I can't grind for it, it's a bummer but can you please fix this issue?"
It's so hard to get ur favorite servants   and to get the crystals for them to high of a cost. I want my Scathach
The story is what makes this game great.. Leveling characters does take a while and quartz prices are ridiculously high but if your patient you can build a good team. My only suggestion is to streamline the game. There is way too much loading.
"Newbie here. I want to play this game, I really do. However, I couldn't get past some of the loading screens early game. Just kept crashing over and over. Reinstalled thinking it would help, but now it crashes after the title screen. Such a shame."
This was an awesome  app wish I could play it without constantly updating it
Game is not starting when it did before. so it's  simple you get one star for faulty patches and inability to fix quickly. So much for a high grossing game
Game wouldn't load after the start up screen. Kept crashing
I really love the Visual Novel & the Characters ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Great for Fate fans or those looking to kill some time.
Simple yet satisfying gameplay and a great story backed by professional voice talent makes this a no-brainer to get
"The salt on here, reddit and their Facebook page brings a smile to my face."
Pretty fun and addicting.
Great game if you're a fate fan. Except that it won't even start anymore so rip.
This a well design game with a lot of dedication and love put into it. The graphics and controls are fantastic but the only flaw of the game is that it requires a lot of grinding to start up. It is also unfortunate that your choices during the story don't affect the conclusion of the game. In the end you are only reading a pre-written story that unfolds in front of you while you collect powerful servants and build interesting teams.
I actually like it but it freezes all the time
Can't play.
Good game with somewhat okay story. Definetly something for fate fans to enjoy. Only downside is the tediousness require to get 5 star units. And the price to get these items to draw is quite expensive. Not recomended for f2p users.
Tried it out since a friend recommended the game full farmed the nobunaga event or whatever as well as clearing a bunch of the story. However the game is way too cash grabby and has too many flaws so probably going to stop playing it and stick to other games
Rates way to low for good servants
I got Altera!!!!
the 1.7 uodate caused me to crash over and over and i cant get on
Finally out for engish.
It's good but needs work around the edges
I found myself fast forwarding the story. Plus the battles or the villains weren't impressive.
just amazing !
I'm not sure what's going on with this but it doesn't even boot up on my essential phone and I'm not a fan of the permission for boot
I love fate they need to add astolfo
Drop rate for decent hero's near impossible.
Great mobile game
"I love Fate, so I love this game too. It's a solid mobile game, great story and fully voiced."
The game is pretty fun and money isn't something they force you to use. However they do make it pretty hard to not spend money to progress a little faster.  Pretty addicting if you have any interest in the fate series world.
Everything I wished for but only limited by time but is perfect for me for a free to play.
Very fun with good artwork.
"Fast paste, Favorite Servants { Especially Oda :3}"
A must play for any Type Moon fan. Rarely will you NEED to buy anything.
SSR rate so low
Good game. Just wish the gacha rates were better!!
Been gaming with FGO since Japan version started. Never stopped since.
So much fun as long as you don't lose your mind.
Fans of the series love it. This is actually my first entry to the Fate series and I still enjoy it greatly as an Android game. Not for the micro-transaction faint of heart though.
Wouldn't run on my Galaxy S8. Sent email to the dev team. Will revise if they come back with anything useful..
"I know it's a gacha but I can't help but wish for higher rates.... Aside from that, as a fate fan, it's really good and pretty f2p friendly. Would recommend to any fate fan."
"Thoroughly enjoy this game, as a fan of the Fate Franchise. Has become very addicting^^"
I really enjoy this game
Crashes litterally every 10 minutes... cant even do story without it crashing
Awesome Game Love It !
"Great game, amazing story line.  I would have given full five stars. But take heed of the comments people, getting 5 star servants is near impossible in this game, 4 stars are a little easier due to events.  Summon rates are just god awful can spend alot of quartz and not get a 5 star barely a 4 star if super lucky.  Please do not waste your money here. Also its dumb to mix craft essence with servants for summons, makes the chances even harder.  Overall good game though with great graphics."
Cany even play...
This game isn't letting me transfer data over from my old device to my new one. I re made a transfer number and password and tried probably ten times but nothing
I love this game but it keeps logging me out its really annoying at this point plz fix
"Just amazing, no complaints"
This game is super cool and easy to play and the most part what I love is the characters show their stories what happen to them in real life. I love this gameüíñüå∑üëëüíé
Was really good game would have given five stars if it wouldn't kick me off for three days every time there's an update
"this game is one of the most frustrating yet makes you feel the most accomplished. It has a great, compelling storyline and can be cleared with any servant. The gacha is mainly to get your favorite waifu and its really hard to with only a 1% chance to get a 5* character. When you do pull it, the feeling of accomplishment is much better than most games. Give it a try"
"Refuses to run on rooted phones. It doesn't crash, just closes and opens up an email to support, who will also refuse to help you. I think PayPal might be triggering on the ""send email"" action which is a PayPal issue instead.  Anyway, it looks like I spent about a half hour just to find out I'm simply not allowed to run this game for some reason."
Great game. Don't have to spend a dime to keep up with other players because there is no PvP.  Rate up is a lie though. Don't believe their lies.
Love it. Crazy about it.
Great game. Addicting and very enjoyable. Recommend it.
Love this game. Everything is great about this game
Love this game and the characters . Addicted to it. Makes my mundane life exciting . There is always something to look forward to in this game
"This is a great game. Amazing. Always makes me happy , excited"
"Does not work, only tries to open a email to support."
Love the show and game
"I enjoy FGO, it's got it's problems but it's simple gameplay is made fairly engaging by the story and characters"
LOVE IT!
I got addicted to this game...
Crashes on startup on my HTC One M8. Immediately opens a PayPal window trying to get me to send their support team money... This happens to quite a few people... Beware!
PLAY 4 WAIFU PAY 4 NP5 WAIFU x3
Love the game really enjoyable but one glaring issue.... Iskandar.... he's not in the game.
Make more game like this
Love the fate series as a whole and this game but I curse RNG I have spent about $400 and I only have 3 5 star servant drop rate why.
gacha is my life
Like it
It's a great game and I'm in love with it.  The gatchas are a slippery slope though
Awesome story with cool characters and fun gameplay
"Great storyline, just don't get addicted to the gacha"
"From gameplay to story, This game is good! Gacha may have bad luck at times but it has been good in the long run by story and graphics!"
"Perfect Fate Game, no p2w."
Love the game cause I love the Fate series. The gameplay is actually very slow paced. A lot of grinding.
It's Fate.
"Constant loading screens, jittery animations"
Installed the game and it is forcing open PayPal and trying to make me send them money.
"Not to bad but items you need to rank up are few and few between, some are not even there except in events but regular ones are rare drop at a very low rate"
"Well this game wouldn't run on my galaxy note 8. Every time I would open the app, it would force PayPal open and wanted me to send money to Fates support email. I scoured online to see if anyone else had this issue but didn't see anything at all. Guess this just won't be for me."
Great game it's very fun and love the whole cast of characters coming in soon
I just love it. A mobile game based on my favorite Anime is something I love.
OKITA MY WAIFU WHY WONT YOU COME TO ME!!!
"The story and gameplay is certainly great, but beware of the addiction this game presents. To put it simply, be wise with your money."
"Fun game and there is some strategy behind it. Too bad the gacha rates for 5 star servants is beyond ridiculous. That being said, game is playable with a solid team of 3 stars."
"Fun game, but you'll have to be really lucky to land those rare summons."
"Repetitive gameplay and expensive. Everytime I put money into it, it was never worth it. The Gacha rates are just BAD.   I would uninstall if I wasn't obsessed with the FATE series.   The events actually have decent rewards, but otherwise, most of the gameplay is very unrewarding and it takes many slow battles to get anywhere.   As far as story, I'd call it cute and funny. Not very captivating like what i'd expect from FATE.   If the game was just a bit more rewarding, it would be worthwhile. Good time killer. It'd be nice if I could skip the battle animations."
I love this game but i believe in my personal opinion that a multiplayer pvp will be a great addition to this game so people can have friendly matches to see who is the best
Love it but I got a new phone and my data isn't transferring is there a way I can get my old account ?
"Clearly, playing moe versions of historical and mythical figures is addicting. It stagnates quickly, but rewards a good grind."
"Couldnt play, doesnt seem to work for the LG v30"
Can't launch the game at all
Tame all my money
Awosme game
So awesome! I've been waiting for this game for so long
"The only mobile game, I have ever gotten addicted to."
"I loved the Fate series!, and I haven't found problems with it yet. Good Work!"
"I'm rating at 1 star because the game developed a fatal error which prevented it from opening, and I was forced to uninstall. Reinstallation forced me to start from scratch, thereby wasting all the time and resources I spent on this game."
Love this game so far. Have been running into an issue where the game will crash for seemingly no reason since Gudaguda started though. Nothing was running in the background at those times but I'm confident you'll fix that hiccup soon.
Great story and love the series
"Waifus and saber face¬¥s, do you want something better?"
Hella grinding and hella salt but really fun
It is amazing! !
I haven't really got into games for my phone until this amazing game. I can barely put it down it's so addicting. Only problem I have is it always closing in the middle of a battle but that's ok since it saves before it happens. Overall great game and perfect opportunity to get into the Fate series for new fans or expand on it for old fans.
If you spend money on this game and plan to upgrade your phone you will not be able to recover your account.
This game is awesome I am fan of fate series keep up the good work
Love the game but after the latest update it crashes in the middle of battle for no reason.
"Game is not complete, there are only 3 chapters to play.   The grind is real, so be ready to shell out 30+$ for one set of gacha spins.   Drop rates for 5 star items is so low its pretty insulting.  The gameplay is ok, very repetitive. Decent graphics but animations look ridiculous due to puppet style motion."
Give more freedom for Free Players
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  There is no reward for paying in this game.  Drop rates are so incredibly dismal you'll never get the units you actually want.
Not a very good game but you lose all progress and money spent if you uninstall with out your transfercode which is completely rediculous so if you can avoid this trash
Good time waster but almost impossible to get good characters without paying a heavy price. The price tag for the characters are not worth the gameplay
"it's a great game and a well addition to the fate series, I just wish there was an easier way to retrieve a lost account"
10 outta 10 would eat storage space again now to waste all my money on saint quartz
I wasted over 100 bucks on the game but now its force closing me out I had no choice to reinstall it AND IT KEEPS ON CLOSING ME OUT
"So fun! Very immersive game with a great storyline that keeps you interested, good graphics, easy controls, and fairly easy to learn how the game works. Probably my favorite game at the moment!"
Tis fate
I love the game but whenever I summon it only gives me 4-5 star essence not servants but as much as I have summoned I should get something plz fix
Great game to pass the time
"Been a fan of the series for a long time, though it is more camp than the original, that makes it more enjoyable for people who are new to the series."
Play all the time great way to learn and see new servants in the fate universe
Always have liked the fate/stay series fate/grand order is another part of the fate/stay series that I have come to love
Amazing I haven't been able to get into a phone game until this
Better rates please
If you love the Fate franchise you will love this.
Awesome like the anime
Jeanne best girl
"My new favorite game, if you want a great RPG for mobile don't miss it!"
So lit!!
umm im in canada and i cant play this for whatever reason??????
"The most harshest gatcha game I've ever known. $300 worth of ""quartz"" won't even get the summon you want from the event banner. Play this game with the mentality of enjoying the story and it should be fine."
Great game for Fate fans and those who are new to new to the series. As it gives enough lore for you to know each unit. The only down side is that there is no autoplay but how the gameplay is I can't see how you could make it work.
Clean
Never thought it would come to the west
Un buen  app lo recomiendo
"Now if only there's a way to get servants from past events, that'll be perfect."
"Had to uninstall it.  So whrn I go to re install it it tells me I have to start over.  No warning of ""hey we don't keep your info so unless you do some transfers you'll never see your stuff again"".  Got really boring and repetitive too."
"Very fun, just be careful to not spend too much on the gacha"
Gatcha salt simulator but you gotta do it for the waifus
Doesn't work
"Yo, this game is an anime on Netflix, and now that I understand a good deal of the story.... I want Frankenstein."
This game is absolutely and utterly beautiful! I have been and still am a huge fan of the Fate Series and this game is just making the flame grow hotter! Beautiful! Just simply amazing!
Make a quest that you can get saint stars every day
The best stuff takes time to get but that's my only complaint.
GACHA GIVETH GACHA TAKETH
The game itself is great.  I love the fact that its not PvP oriented and let's you play as who you want.  Overall the game is a awesome game that is extremely addictive.
Another gatcha with really bad rates and not very fun if u dont sink alota $ into it also uses a stupid code setup to save your data
"An awesome, old skool style RPG."
Fun way to jump into the fate lore and meet new servants
Great Holy GraiL
All in all a good game for all those fate fans and non fans
It's the English version but it's not available in my country. Email sent already
Crashes a lot
I download the game but it's not letting me play
I love the Fate series and this game is amazing.
"Fun game, excellent graphics."
"Fantastic, only complaint are the terrible gacha rates"
It the best game
Doesn't even boot up
Good game. Keep it up
Fate Grand Order is a great game with an amazing story but the rates to pull good units is far too low. Normally this would be ok but there are hardly any handouts for long time free to play players. And the cost to buy currency is back breaking. $200+ is the expected cost for 1 unit.  Please address one of these issues. This game would be an easy 5 stars but the lack & cost of currency makes it difficult to recommend this game to anyone.
"The game itself is great, but the servant draw rates are atrocious. Not a single 5 star servant in over 200 draws."
This game is fun so far.üëå
It's fun and I love the story mode
Spooked by Kirei
Game is glitchey and keeps force closing on me or the game times out on me to quickly
"Addicting game, very fun combat system, nice story and events."
Fate-tastic!!!
"Simple, casual, and fun. Collecting your favorite servants is a blast and the casual aspect allows the game to be played at any pace you wish. The rates aren't as good as some other gatcha games for the gatcha itself, but it isn't enough for me to knock a star off. Great game."
Fantastic game that makes you wanna raise your waifu with pride!
Just what you would expect from a type moon project lol
Awesome game play
Its a really fun game overall can't get enough of it. Love the Fate series and this just makes it better!
"A game to avoid unless you have money and like the franchise. The only good things in this game are the story and the characters. Sadly the rate for heroes you like is down right scam(1%) and even if you would want to put money to get who you want the price is absurdly high for still 1%. There's no pity system so pull rate never get better even after putting 300 quartz(pulling money) which is 100try. So for characters it's more like ""you can look but you can't touch""  The combat system is plain boring. Combined with drop rate for mats almost as low than SSR pulling, you get a soul crushing farming, that take hours to do for in the end getting nothing. No auto feature, no animation skip and slow even at x2.  The quality is also really unequal. You have some really good art but also some horrible one. Sometime the story is great, sometime you think it as been wrote by a 3years old. The animation for some hero is really neat but for most it's a generic animation made with paint."
"Great gameplay, awesome game. Keeps improving and keeps getting better"
"The game is great overall, but I kinda wish that you add more event frequently and add more updates so it's catch up the jp ver."
"Nice game, Marie is Cutie"
I love this game but it constantly crashes. That and the file size are my only real complaints. But this game is amazing for a phone game
"Anyone that watch or read the anime should get the game since it beyond fantastic. Great gameplay, storyline, characters, combat is simple, good time waster, and overall a great game. I wish there was a game like this on the Xbox One or PS4."
Good game but stupidly expensive. One 10 card premium draw will cost around $20.00 USD  Two of those and one could buy Fate/stay in full.
Love the fate series and this game
It is ok but the oide one is better
"Good game overall. A bit disappointed, game has no pvp or multiplayer feature."
"An excellent turn based RPG that has an excellent story and is a great tie in to the Fate TypeMoon franchise but also serves as a good introduction to those who haven't had much experience with Fate. The game mechanically isn't difficult but does possess some depth to it for those who like to min Max. The gacha is infamous but the game is rather fair for its kind of free to play mobile gaming, but is a pretty good salt mine, bad civilization if you catch my drift but worth it. Most notably the game is able to be completed, and the most difficult challenges overcome with out spending any money but does require more skill. I'd suggest it if you are at all into Fate or Japanese rpgs."
Best game ever!!
"I used to like this game but since I lost my account and I'm not even able to bind it to my Facebook account for easy recovery, send an email to try to recover but it was impossible. Art is great but the gameplay is somewhat tepid to be honest. Not playing this game again in the foreseeable future."
Really great game. Especially if you like the Fate series
"While a glorified source of gambling problems for many, I think this is alright as a game. Tho I do find the inclusion of an energy bar is a bit annoying."
"The translations need work and the gacha rate is insanely low (but thats just me being salty), overall its a great game! Not really a game to play on-the-go in my opinion. The story content is amazing which is very surprising for a mobile game. I thought the game and battle system was insanely simple but the farther I progress in the story and during events (like Nero fest *cries*) it becomes more challenging and has depth. Characters are also very lovable and original (except for the saber faces...). I love how unlike other mobile games 4-tiers and below are basically useless but in this game even my rarity 3 characters can surpass my 5 tier characters. Cu is best dog (e)."
"Beautiful game with decent graphics but combat is pretty dull and lifeless. Also the drop rates are some of the lowest I've ever seen in a game. If you're not planning to spend copious ammounts of real money, don't hold your breath on getting good units."
Galaxy s8. Game stopped working recently. Please fix
Would like to rate the game higher but after two reinstallations can't even open the game once to play.
"The game is fun but there are a few issues. Costs are high and rates are abysmal. Costs about 40$ for a couple of 10x pulls. The rates are so low that even during an event with boosted rates, you are still almost certainly not going to get what you're after. You can stockpile free resources rather than spend money. Two weeks of dailies and logins will let you do roughly 3 single pulls. Took over 120 pulls to get a 4 star (not the rarest) character that had a boosted drop rate. During those pulls I received zero 5 star characters. During the halloween boosted draw, I actually spent some money along with my stockpile for a total of 91 pulls. This time I actually got two 5 star characters...neither of them were the character with the boosted drop rate. So yeah, the game is fun, but you have to play with the mindset that you will almost certainly NOT get the characters you want."
"Fantastic, addicting, amazing! Hoping that they rerun some of the old events to get some of those special variant Servants."
I'll never understand why it keeps on freeze up on me I can't play it I wanted saber so much that I would do anything to get her
Fun game like how f2p friendly it is
'S good
It's good 10/10
I like the storyline and the servants aswell as non-servant character development and design. Medusa is still my favorite in the fate series. It's too bad she didn't have more screen time to devil in the story more...
Rate up is lie üòÇüòÇ
I love the holy Grail animes so this game is like a dream come true . I love getting to be a master.
"Having a lot of fun playing, just need to get Jeanne d'arc and I'll he happy"
Its really good but if only there was a way to get lots of crystals.
It's the best game ever
"I like this game. But something just ain't right with the summons. I have summoned 15 time on an event summons and have still not gotten the 5 star that is ""supposedly"" had its drop chance risen. I have, however, received other 5 stars. The way this game does summons is ridiculous. I don't mind paying, but there has to be a limit. When you've paid enough to pay for someone salary and you still can't get a summon that is supposedly easier get, that is called a bug, or it is intentional for screwing people out of their money. Otherwise, if you avoid the summons, it's fun."
Great stuff
Love how the game is made very fun and a good story
You can kind of play with friends. Friends benefit definitely! But love it. One of my favorite anime love the story twist.
I just love this game story and the graphics are are very nice plus character design is nice. The only thing that pain me is the gotcha rate for higher tier characters is very low but i still love this game
It's fun I guess.
The help from cs to get my account back is trash
To expensive to buy anything worthwhile in the game store & takes to long to lvl characters to progress in the game.
This game is really fun and I really love the game
Its amazing its bring back memories from the anime
"I'm sure I would love this game if I could manage to launch it. Currently crashes on start on my tab s3. Sent an email to the devs with the error code/description... Hopefully the devs fix this issue soon :)  Update: So apparently the problem is that I have USB Debugging turned on and that they purposly make the app abruptly quit if this setting is turned on. Since I am a developer and I need this setting turned on (I'm sure a lot of other people feel this way as well), this app is now useless to me... I'm sure the devs of this app took did this to minimize cheating.... But 90% of the people  who have this setting turned on don't have it for any malicious purpose... Oh well... Such a shame.... Fate is one of my favorite animes....but I will be uninstalling this one..."
At least in bleach brave souls it has a 3% chance of getting a 5 star but in this game it's just a mere 1% I would like to see it buffed up to maybe a 3%  and sometimes a summons that gives double chance
Love  the  game and I  enjoy  everything  but  the  low gotcha rates.
It goooodddd
"Wish the summoning was better and that they would update the story faster, but other than that its alright. It is not the best game, but they can improve. I also hope that the developers would actually listen to players and do something about the summoning system. Because as it stands for me its a big draw back."
Amazing very fun
"RPG based on the Fate series. Colorful characters, deep story and interesting gameplay. You can easily get addicted. The only real downer is that it can get grindy."
Phenomenal little game. Collect all your favorite character.
"Waifus, husbandos and story what more could you ask for? Besides the incredibly steep ssr droprate game is great"
Awsome i love it but saint quartz farm is a problem
"Although it crashes on me about 2 or 3 times a week, I love the story and simple game mechanics. It would be nice if there was a servant trading feature."
This game is good but the updates for extra levels need to come out sooner
"One of my favorite games. The gameplay is fun and the story engaging, the events are fair and they're really generous with gacha currency."
A game that nails the ascetic of the fate franchise while still being a card collecter mobile game. I am interested in the visual novel being told but not so much the rpg grind.
Its fantastic
It's fate dude.
"Really enjoyable game. The gameplay seems simple at first glance, but the higher level content requires planning and strategy. Nearly every servant is viable to use and it's fun coming up with unusual teams to challenge yourself. The story is pretty good, especially compared to other mobile games. If you're a fan of the fate franchise I'd definitely recommend it. Even if you aren't already a fan I think you should give it a shot. It works as a standalone story and introduction to the franchise."
Love it fun game to play but we need more waifus!
the most fun gacha game I've played
Very well put together localization needs a bit of work but overall stellar
I enjoy it when I can play it but it crashes every 5 minutes
Pony i spy i love game but they took the game off the play store
Its pretty good - the only downside is that its a huge drain on my battery and it takes up a lot of space.
"Customer support is 11/10, game is fun, doable by playing for free since you can earn paid currency but rather tempting to buy until you look at the rates. Wish there was noble phantasm skip button but o well. Best to play after familiarizing yourself with the fate series a little. Movie pretty much covers the prologue. And reading the other 1* reviews, MAKE SURE TO BIND YOUR ACCOUNT and keep the bind code somewhere handy. Then you won't lose your account :) - my room-&gt; scroll down -&gt; issue transfer"
"Great game, support team is quick and effective. Fixed my issue within 15 minutes. Lots of verification, but at least they get the job done. Thanks again!"
is a good game keeps crashing for samsung
Too hard to pull out any good characters. Only for big spender
"Cool, great game. It's a good anime mobile game of the Fate series. Perfect if you're a fan"
"1% is considered a rate-up for their gacha rates. If that doesn't dissuade you, you're a masochist or you have stupid amounts of money."
I liked how easy some of the characters where to get
"I'd love this game if I could access the server,  unfortunately for anyone in Utah, I've mysteriously been unable to connect to the server and actually play threw game. As such I can't recommend it in its current state."
It's a fun game. Enjoyable battle system
Auto sends email with your phone data
"I'm a huge fate fan and enjoyed this game at the start. But with the latest update it broke my game and I think I lost all my data. Now whenever I start the game up and touch to start, it immediately brings me to a party select screen at the start of a quest. However it shows I only have ?Mash and says I don't have enough party members to begin the quest and none of the other buttons on screen work. Please fix and compensate for all my time grinding just to lose my data from a game update."
Can't be played on a Pixel XL running Oreo.
Wait this isn't Family Guy Online
No Android Oreo 8.0 support. Just crashes. Plenty of apps handle it.
Still can't play it
"This game is super fun and addictive!! I love everything about the fate series and, so far, this has been a great installment."
Yeah I like itlol
"Great game, wish the gamble aspect was a little turn down."
Customer service was very helpful now I can finally play
"i wish the gacha rates were fair. i'm also unable to reclaim my old account, which sucks."
"Great fate nostalgia game, pick your banners carefully though.  Gacha rates can be rough."
Great game for fate fans!
If your a big fate fan you will like this
I just recently got into the Fate series and I love this game
I love it! It's really fun to play
"A good game for the longtime fate fan, and I'd think not a bad place for a newbie to be introduced to the series, spoilers on certain Servants identities notwithstanding. It isn't perfect- for one thing, some of their choices on Servant designs can be bizarre, nonsensical, and to a certain mindset even insulting, and the proliferation of genderbent characters without any sort of justification is one of the few major problems I've had with this franchise over the years. Nevertheless, it certainly won't be a waste of your time to check this out- though if your not careful, it might end up being a huge cash sink as you attempt to role your favourite characters."
"If you love the Fate series, then this is a must have"
It has taken over my brain!
"PLEASE consider increasing the drop rate of 5 star heroes, otherwise, perfect game"
Awesome for Fate fans
Great Game...except for the gacha hehe.
"I love the Fate series and this is a really great game, I just wish I could do more with my Arturia üíó  Amazing game!"
"Great game, best mobile game I've played. it doesn't force you to use money, and it has a well written story. it feels as if you're taken into the world itself, and that is how an rpg should feel."
I love the game so far very well done compared with the animes but Could you imput more servents ranging from the show or maybe some more of there masters to play as servents that would be awesome.
Make it for Nintendo switch please
I feel like this is a game that I wouldn't get tired of. And there is constantly new content! I'm happy!
"One of the most fun mobile games out there. If you are a fan of Fate, gacha games or just well made mobile games, you should definitely play this!"
Very in game feel
"Great game... but needs work on there summoning pool. I drop a few 80 here and there, every time I get a 5star but no 4star... I'm complaining because looking for a 4-star Nora and all I'm getting is 5 star caster... sucks"
Good game so far
Best waifu gacha
Great game. Nice story. Amazing characters.
I like it but it has an issue with crashing
It need more work but it was enjoyable
I hope to have an ssr servant
Love the game but can't play it since it won't open at all anymore.
"The quintessential ""gacha"" game; if you hated them before then this absolutely won't change your mind. However if you're in the mood for a simplistic, turn based ""match three"" style battler with a convoluted, pretentious storyline, attractive people of both genders in tight costumes, and a charmingly bad translation, then I've got good news for you: this will sate that weirdly specific craving."
I loved this game but I forgot to make a transfer code when I upgraded to my note 8 and trying to prove I'm the owner of my old account is proving very difficult. I have three friends that can verify that I pulled both Gilgamesh and Jeanne d'Arc the night I joined as I can't remember a whole lot of details of my account. I might not even bother playing again because I put too much work in it. I don't exactly have a reason to lie about the authenticity of me being the account holder but aniplex doesn't take peoples word I guess. Well it was fun while it lasted.
Perfect... only if new singularities where released faster i want london now
"I love this game and the fate series,but there is one thing that bothers me I have glitch were all the cutscenes and cards are pink. Nothing but pink"
"The drop rate of high star servants is way too low. They are blatantly ripping people off and it's disappointing how many people support it. I got a 5* servant on my first ten roll while others won't get their first 5* for months because of the low drop rate combined with the slow rate of gathering gems. It's absolutely unacceptable that paying $400 does not even guarantee a 5* servant because it's at a fixed rate of 1%. And fans defend this garbage because they're addicted to gatcha gambling while fanfaring that because the game is PvE only and can be ""beat"" by low star servants that it is somehow completely natural and warranted for this anti-consumer practice.  The drop rate for ascension items are also so low you're forced to mindless grind the same dungeon thousands of times for a single item and people will support this because of the fanatical obsession with the property and dismiss it as a mobile game flaw.  Also the amount of content runs out quickly and the team is proven to be time gating content. This is a translation and are releasing content slower than the original release timeline. They are probably just slowing down the content releases to milk the whales as much as possible each month. People praise the thin story like it's anything special because it's connected to the fate franchise. The dialogue choices give a false sense of choice and illusion to fool fanatics into feeling like they are experiencing the original VN. The choices have no bearing on anything because the characters respond identically 90% of the time for either option and the choices presented to you are usually the same as well.  Half of the animations in this game are an absolute joke where they just raise their arm and fire a projectile for pretty much the entire caster class except 5*s. Some of these animations have been updated but many are still just some of most lazy animations I've ever seen. Also who thought it was a great idea to have the back button on android to mean close the entire game instead of going back to the previous screen. It is completely intuitive and something that could easily be changed.  It's a decent game with an average story, good art, and good gameplay mechanics but has some of the most terrible consumer exploitative practices that I have ever seen that also devolves into mind numbingly boring dungeon grinds after the story missions while the team waits to drain whales each month."
"Love the game though the summoning part might be a little rough. Rolling for the servants you want is pretty hard, other then that everything is fine."
It's a fun game but my biggest problem with this is that the chances of you getting what you wanted so slim if they allow you to at least buy one of your favorite servants in a make up for it the rest of the problems to draw system
I hope to make this game world sea so other players can play this :)
One of the best gacha game i have played.
No more spooks no more kirei
"Awesome characters, awesome graphics, awesome story, awesome gameplay!!! but the story just ends... where is the continuation?"
I'm a fan of the fate series
Would like to play the game
"Game would never launch, just sit on the loading screen."
Doesn't run on rooted phones despite the fact that it's 10x easier to run a modded apk to cheat than it is trying to use root access to cheat.
"Really like this game.  I'd like the drop rates to be higher and for servants and craft essences to have different summons or at least bump up servant summon chances.  Biggest issue is the localization.  Many conversations don't flow, and feel choppy, like somebody didn't proof read them.  And then there's some names.  Altria is not the name given to saber in the West at all.  Not remotely.  Please fix the localization.  It's easily the most annoying part of the game for me"
give more us intersting storyline and live rpg üòä
"Game won't play, everytime I try to play it asks me to share it??"
"Keeps freezing on me so I'll come back later. Aside from that trying to build up Mash is a task in of it self. So keep up gr8 work, but I'm out...‚úå"
The games 3rd story has text glitches I don't know if it's part of it but that's pretty disappointing that they put little effort of fixing this problem
Love this game but can it stop crashing when I don't even have it open please...
"Bare bones game, long waits, not even worth playing imo."
The game forces me to choose to open my email and never lets me play the game
This is so bad
Amazing game. Everything is easy to understand and use. Love it.
Customer service blows.
Game will not even open on my Samsung galaxy s6
I love everything about it
They wouldn't let me play.
The game is pretty decent for a free to play game.
Its so amazing i love it
The Game has stunning visuals and an amazing soundtrack. The story is so good.
"I love this game!!!!! I don't care what everyone else thinks , so I looooovvvve this game!!!!!."
Anyone who like the Fate series will love this game
Gatcha rates suck but quality waifus
This is the best game I've ever played.
"This game is pretty fun, I love that they finally brought the Fate franchise to North America and on Android. I'm a fan of the series and sincerely hope that they continue to add more Fate games to Android.   Now about this game's gameplay and mechanics, the game is a gacha type where you level up and ""ascend"" or evolve your legendary heroes from history that of course have some fictional liberties taken to add interest. King Arthur, Joan of Arc, etc. You get to learn bits about the actual legends and it renews interest in historical and mythical figures. I looked up so much because of this app out of curiosity and learned so much. I love that they are continually adding content and that you can really enjoy the ride.  My only complaint is that when it acts like an RPG your options make no difference to the story. Which is a bit disappointing since it appears to give you control when you have none. However this is a relatively small complaint.   I also feel like the in game currency you can buy is really overpriced compared to other games. In order to summon ten craft essences or heroes you have to pay about $24.00.  Which is pricey as that's the only way to guarantee a 4 star craft essence or hero. I'd be more understanding if it was $10.00. Which compared to other games can still be considered a bit much, but I'd be much more likely to buy especially with the 1% five star drop rate.   But honestly I love the game, I haven't spent much on it because frankly I can't justify $24.00 for 10 things. But if I'm close to saving up enough of the gift currency I buy enough to finish the most I've spent is $5-10 that way. Honestly I would spend much more if it was priced a bit lower.   I love the art and effort put into the game and I have logged in pretty much religiously since it came out. I don't mind grinding for ascension materials or waiting for new content because they have lots of events that fill in the time.   Thank you for bringing Fate/Grand Order to North America! &lt;3"
It's cool Coolio My Dudes ;)
"I really freaking love this game, I usually play it in the mornings before school just to see what's new, and it's great.  I just wish it didn't bring out my gambling addiction."
A great way to enjoy the Fate franchise in a whole new way!
"Such an amazing game, like wow it dosent get any better."
"I was never really a fan of the Fate universe, but the story in this has really kept me engaged!"
Game is good for fans of the anime but the spawning rates are a bit low for the amount of work it takes to earn one saint quartz and you need at least three to get a summon that will most likely be a craft essence than an actual servant. Wish they would separate the spawns between servants and craft essences as it makes summoning a servant (especially if it's not a weak duplicate)  extremely rare.  You end up with more craft essences than you will need for the majority of what little servants you have/eventually get. The battles will start to feel repetitive and lose it's luster when you spend all your mana prisms on summon tickets(which has a limited amount before you have to wait for 16+ days to be able to exchange again) and saint quartz for summons that will turn out to be things you predict them to be. I liked the game at first but it's poor spawn rates have really made me kinda wander from the game a bit as of late.
I dunno
Amazing and highly addictive
Surprisingly deep mechanics make this a fun game to play.
Wish the gacha was cheaper :(
Super cool
It is a very nice game
It keeps constantly closing the game plz fix bugs otherwise imma get mad -3-
its a fun simple game
Surprisingly fun game with engaging lore
Remind the anime series..love it
It's a great game love it very addictive
Would give 0 stars if possible the game doesn't even start! Waste of time!
Honestly I can't even play it and I never get a response to help get into play I've sent 10 email and nothing.
"Great game, love the fate series so gave this a shot deffinitley worth a try if nothing else. Micro transactions are a little pricey in my opinion but those are optional so take that as you will."
PLEASE MAKE A TOKYO GHOUL VERSION!!!!!!!!!!üôè
Very Fun game for people who like the series
I really love Fate. I love the app too... But there's a slight bug you should fix. It keeps shutting down at random. No error message either. please respond with suggestions or just patch the problem.
Downloaded 3x. Wouldn't load.  Said something about improper game environment and tried to send me an email. Apps that won't load = 1 star
It just won't start for me.
Pretty fun but the crashes get pretty annoying
I will change to 5 star if I could transfer data from old phone. I had emiya and the 50000 likes ticket
"I'm not happy really detect data, new game I say NO! BUT ERROR CODE:"
"Fairly decent game. Battles are quick, but can get intense. I'm not the biggest Fate fan, but I know enough that the various jargon used throughout isn't flying over my head, and the story has been interesting so far."
Crashes a lot on my ZTE
Can't give an actual rating. Does not work on OnePlus 3T. Crashes without loading.
Awsome grafics kicks but  love playing
5 stars are so easy to obtain as long as you know how RNG works
Pay to win piece of trash. You won't like this unless you pay out or are extremely lucky.
Simple sweet and full of story good design and amazing sprits please release the next chapter soon I'm chomping at the bit here
Keeps on crashing can't play it but other than that it's good
"Somehow, these fu**ing geniuses thought removing support for rooted devices was a good idea. I guess it worked for the abomination called Pokemon go, so it must be a good practice, right?  Don't bother if your device is rooted, or is modified in any way whatsoever. Also, turn off USB debugging, because that matters. ;)"
Man the story mode isn't even fully out üò° Boring once u finish story mode.
Great fun game!
Summon rates are the worse I've seen next to final fantasy BE and brave frontier.
increased summon rate it is a lie. don't fall for it. it is a humongous money grab with the description of a free game.
App just crashes when launched.
Wonnt even start on my tablet.
They're starting off pretty good but they're pretty expensive they want too much money for too little I've already purchased about almost $80 worth of there gems and didn't really get anything that I wanted was trying to go for a 5-star servant but did not get one you would think by putting at least $80 that you would at least get one five-star servant considering that they have advertising in Giant gold letters that the drop rate is up but it actually is not the rates are very low you'll get good crafting items but that's about it so don't hope for too much as far as obtaining a good servant and as far as putting money on to this game I will not be doing that anymore they're way too expensive for too little and they have horrible deals
"Honestly, a disappointment. I'm not a huge Fate fan, but I was expecting at least /some/ quality with such a big franchise, and with all the hype that FGO has been getting. But, the battle system is simply ""all right"", and the translation stinks. At least get a proofreader to double-check for errors before release! Also, for a game that's been launched so long elsewhere, it's pretty sad that it managed only two and a half chapters (with terrible translations) in it's English/global launch. I play a lot of mobile games in general, and if this one didn't have the Fate brand attached to it, I would have uninstalled after the first few days. As it is, I'm sticking it out to see if things improve. (But I'm not going to hold my breath.) Oh, and this has one of the worst gacha rates I've ever had the displeasure to experience. And I've experienced /a lot/."
Game crashes everytime i open it. Plz fix
Didn't work with my pixel XL
"The game now works on Android 8.  So I am sinking time in it.  Like it so far, a bit of a grind so be prepared."
After waiting 1 hour for it download still unable to play game sat for 3 hours on a loading screen thank you for waisting my time this is one of my favorite anime and you have pissed me off with it where I dont even want to watch it again let alone try to play your game
"Seriously, do not buy Saint Quartz to summon when drop rate is not up! you're wasting your money if you keep doing that!"
"Except some translations issues, the game overall is quite fun"
"Crash on start, sent me straight to gmail with an error code that I sent to devs. Game play seems okay, not my cup of tea."
"Unable to play in usb debug mode, I'm not gonna switch it off just to play one game."
"Lately, my phone's been getting problems on turning on. The only way I can fix it is to restart it everytime. I suspect it has something to do with this app because not only did the problem start when I updated it to the latest version, everytime I restarted it, I get a notification about the game or a message telling me the app crashed. If possible, can you look into this problem? I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S5. The game is pretty fun by the way."
How to recover account?
Good story and just generally addictive
"Doesn't start up half the time on my s8, can't go full screen, and freezes often"
Please enable root support.
Amazing !!!! A good game &lt;3
Worst thing that I have happen is is crashes on my tablet but the app is designed so you won't ever lose progress from it
"The game is very enjoyable. It freezes, lags, and sometimes close on me, but I still very much enjoy it. I hope it improves even more in the future."
I love playing this game though I didn't know it was a game till a few days ago üòÖüòÖ but what I love even more then this game was the anime special of it and I was wondering/hoping that you guy/girls would make a anime series out of this I believe that a large amount of people    would love to watch it and who knows u might even get more people playing this
"Gotta give it one star. Everytime I download it and try to play, it instantly boots up my PayPal and tried to force a ""support payment"". :/.   Not impressed."
"PLEASE FIX THE ERROR WHEN  OPENING THE APP ,I LOVE THE FATE GAMES PLEASE FIX A.S.A.P"
"Game wouldn't run due to my device having Developer Options and USB debugging enabled...  Not changing my settings for the one game that won't run with my configuration.  Here I was hoping to get my Fate fix on, oh well."
It's a very addictive and fun experience with fun story and characters
"As a fan of the Fate series my review is a bit biased, but this game is fun. It's simple to pick up and play, nothing complex. But with all games this one has some ups and downs.  Without major spoilers, you're part of an organization called Chaldea, and it's up to you to summon heroes from mythology, called Servants, to help save the world. Seems overused but the game has it's own unique way of telling the story.   The graphics look great, though while each Servant you use have their own designs the enemies are almost all the same. Maindifferences in enemies are usually some re-coloring or they're holding different weapons. This isn't bad per-se seeing as we, the players, are still in the early part of the game.  Continuing onto the servants, each one has their own set of skills, looks, and ultimate attack called a ""Noble Phantasm"" or ""NP"" for short. And there are a wide assortment of heroes you can summon. From the fan favorite Saber aka King Arthur to Emporer Julius Caesar.  Each servant falls into a ""class"". Saber, Archer, Lancer, Caster, Assassin, Rider, and Berserker. Each class their own strength and weakness.  Now some bad things to note that exist at the time of this review. Since the game hasn't been out for too long in the US you will see multiple of the same servants all the time. This is only a timed problem because more servants are being released in the near future.  Another thing is many servants have the same attack animation. When you play the game you'll understand what I mean. But I did say many and not all. Reason is a few servants have their own specific attack animations. These usually consist of the fan favorite servants of bones fans will instantly recognize.  One fin thing to wrap up this review, if you do not, I repeat, DO NOT like random gambling then you probably won't like this game. Reason I say this because to get servants you spend the currency, saint quartz, to summon them. Each summoning is random and you can either get two or three servants, or even a super rare servant, in a roll. Or you can get craft essences, Which are little cards you can freely give (or take) to a servant for a boost in health, attack, and a craft essence bonus."
"Great story even if the gacha sistem is kinda bad the characters ,story and events really make up for it"
Game fails to launch.
Rejoice Fate fans. Your wish of FGO coming Stateside has come true.
"F2P stay away. It's P2W heavy so unless you spend money, you won't get all those OP or good character."
Gacha suks. Fate rules.
Do not waste your money on summons the drop rate is really really low. I was a victim of wasting money and recieved zero 5* ssr that are not available in story. My advice play the game for free. I recieved my only 5* on one lucky summon with cyrstals I earned in story mode. Other than the horrible drop rate on summons the game can be fun it definitely has potential and if you can obtain one of the 5* has great SSR's. Im not spending no more money and the game is enjoyable. My advice play free and grind out the story and events and you will enjoy it.
Takes for ever to load sometimes but I do like the game and story for it so far
"Game has adware, drop rates are real bad, poor account save. The art work is this games best feature"
"I love it but its to laggy for me, i cant get thru a battle without it freezing"
Since the update cane out I cannot update the app I've gone through both Google and fate support service and nothing. üò°
The game is fun and exciting but the summoning rates are very horrible and literally you cannot pull anything
One of my fav mobile games
Pure fun
It's good get it
Great game so much fun. Very addicting
"I love this game , me and my sister play a lot honestly but for what ever reason when I try to do a quest or events and sometimes even summoning, I get kicked out of the game . I hope this could be fixed in future updates , keep up the good work!"
Waifus/10
Recommended for any Fate fan and people who enjoy turn based games. Also recommended for people leaving Brave Frontier because this is a million times better.
It was a very good game.
REALLY fun game but the drop rates are just horrible. Love it though.
Is just a good game.
"I'd like to play the game, it keeps crashing however. Oh well...."
Awesome but they need to update the story quicker I'm to hooked on it to wait.
"Its great. The only problem i have is it crashing in the middle of battles. Luckily you can restart where you left off when it crashed, so nothing ill lose sleep over."
I love the Fate series and the gameplay was amazing.
Kiyohime is the best
Great game but takes up a lot of space.
"Loving the new update. Runs faster, UI is improved,  and I see y'all touched up on the gameplay. Keep doing what y'all are doing guys"
"What the heck, after the maintenance on august 31, the game redownload all the content and i lost my account. I didnt save the code so now i have no way to retrieve my acc. What the f. Not going to start it all over again..."
I hope we can get the other singularity soon.
I will probably not stop until the next Fate based game.  And that is okay.
"Updated to support Android 8, good stuff. Thanks for the support and awesome game."
"Interesting story and characters.  The gameplay is simple, but fun."
It is amazing especially since im a fate fan :3 hail Emiyan but i do wish there was a back button for when you press attack by accident and you mess up your strategy.
YES
what a generous game.
Oddly addicting. Fun game that has nice art moves and requires strategy. Requires dedication to really get to the challenging parts.
10 out of 10
Love this game..thank you dw and aniplex
It's a great game for fans of the series as well as a good starting point for new people to get into the series.
Game won't even launch. Instantly crashes
Really good game but not sure if third singularity is supposed to be locked?
Does not work for Android 8.0 (Oreo) BE CAREFUL before upgrading. Submitted a ticket and got nowhere for a fix :(
Would rate it higher if it wasn't annoying to start up the game. I've never had to turn off usb debugging for a game.
Doesn't work on android oreo.
So much fun love the animation and story
When I download the app and when I try to open the app and it crashes please fix
"Has a good story line and good events that keep the player interesting. Good cutcene as well that can be replayed. However, it's very hard to obtain rare servants along with obaitaining items needed ascending/evolving the servant due to low drop rates."
Been wanting to play this game for years. Dreams do come true.
Great game and Fate series was wild
This game is amazing! Its really fun to go through the story and events. The game doesn't force you to spend money for the premium currency. You have so many chances to get them. And the writing is some of the best writing in any mobile game I've played. Even better some console or PC games. I highly recommend this game.
It is awesome!
"If you're into Fate, you'll probably be into this. But as far as I'm concerned: -Game mechanics combine into a clustertruck of features -Inconsistent frame rates -Camera pops into different positions annoyingly  -The story is a thick soup that's not to my taste"
"The game is fun and the controls are easy to learn. The best part of the game comes when you unleash your Noble Phantasms, cutscenes are awesome, especially Emiya and Carmilla. The only downside is the terrible rate of gacha pulls worse than any other game of it's kind. Spent 90 orbs (3 10x pulls) I have been grinding for a week and only have 1 4-star servant. The fact that when you do a 10x gacha pull where you get more pointless craft essences is dumb. Besides the worst gacha rates I have ever seen, the game is really well made."
Hey all I got say to this game as I'm going to give it another try is that for the sake of Fairness they need to have a Banner the doubles the rate of 5 Star Servants otherwise people who play on this WILL rage quit just cause they should get one for all the trouble they go through to get one. Until then it's 3 Star will go up once those Rates change.
"Honestly the best game you can play right now on Android devices, that is free"
"The game wouldn't even launch. It opened an email to send the devs, who promptly told me to disable is debugging. There's not any compelling reason their game can't work if that's turned on, and I use it for more important purposes than a silly little game. I wish I'd had the opportunity to at least check the game out, but c'est la vie."
"Great addition to the Fate series. Very loyal to the contents and not shy in design and art of the franchises characters. Original story that can feel dragged on, with little to no impact of your answer choices towards the stories. However, with room to spare and ideas galore, are some of the main points the Fate  series has in growing. So much untapped potential.  Yet, the characters, settings, dialogue and chemistry is some of the best I've seen on mobile platforms. And beyond most anime / novel inspired games and above all of the mobile Shonen games category.  (Fate is NOT Shonen and thank goodness it isn't. This is for people with a conscious and crave deep story telling with no filter. My opinion but is just that.)"
LMFAO I GOT ORION ON MY SECOND x10 SCOUT! (First scout was the free one during the tutorial) I guess I'm pretty lucky
"Game wont start, so devs want me to change the default settings on my phone by turning off USB debug mode. Uh yeah NO, I have never had a problem with any other game! Furthermore I need USB debug ON in order to transfer files etc via USB to my computer! Devs of this game are stupid AND RUDE to want me to change my phones default settings just so they dont have to put in extra work for compatibility. UNINSTALLED!"
A true homage to the fate series. I love it and I can't wait for the updates that will move the story even farther
Telling me I can't have a rooted phone is a joke.
"If you love FATE, and collecting Waifus/Husbandos, this is the game for you. Maybe you prefer Gar or Regend, they have it all. So why wait, download this super fun and well made game right now."
Tried buying  12 quartz today no luck this is frustrating cause I asked for help on the issue and no reply for about a week now üò≠
Great game very good control
"They make you think you can get 5stars servants. The truth is, those things are only accessible in other's accounts. NOT YOURS. 1% rate is a lieÔºå there are no 5 stars servants. ;) FKtypemoon. edit:after i gave this review, my client recieved a mysterious patch. Then I uses my last 9 saint quartz to give this game a last shot. Got 5 stars ssr Orion. This game is great."
Wouldn't even open on my phone. Also it kept interrupting what I was doing randomly to try to send reports.
My main gripe right now  I stopped playing for a while so I uninstalled it how do I recover my saved data? I cleared the three Singularity and actually got a few servants I DO NOT WANT TO START OVER
Aside from the drop rates. This game is wonderful. The events are fun and the story is interesting. Pretty rare for a mobile game in my experience.
Greatest mobile game ive played. Story is good too
LOVE IT
Fun and easy to get the hang of
"Just play it! If you want a fun game with a great story, you really shouldn't even debate it."
A Fate Series Fan's Fantasy Come True.
LOVE THIS GAME !!!!
If you're a fate fan you will love this. Really all that needs to be said.
"The graphics are amazing and eye-catching and the controls are easy to learn and use. The gameplay is simply addicting and sometimes hard but I have a noticeable problem with this game. The summoning/gacha pool has 5 star servants which getting them is really hard. Only 1% chance of appearing. With this, it forces the player to spend money on saint quartz to summon more servants but it's understandable since the game is f2p and the company needs to make money off it"
Gacha Rate Up is Lie?
Game won't start on s7. Makes me send an email...
Amazing game. All Fate fans should be playing this.
You don't need to know all about the fate series to be able to enjoy the game.
It wont open for me it just keeps making me ssnd a failure email
This is a great game I also love the anime.. Saber FTW
Game won't load
I loved the game but it closes randomly and you never really get any good servants from 10X quarts summons
Doesn't work on Oreo
Doesn't work with Android 8.0 bummer
Neat for about 10 minutes but incredibly generic
I can't even go into the game... all it does is put me at my home screen
Crashes on Android Oreo.
Can't play because my phone is rooted... devs are idiots
Gatcha is bad civilization

Plz do all the updates quickly
The UI is a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it it's loads of fun!
"When I had an issue, I emailed the company and they immediately solved it! 10/10"
I really love playing this game alot
"5 times 10x summon didn't even have a 4 star servent, you say?"
After playing for a awhile i just got bored of the rng bs 5* hero  rates are 1% and 5* craft essence 4% i dont mind the craft essence being 4% but what set me off was that you put craft essence pulls together with the heroes. How the actual f*@k are you supposed to pull anything without dumping your cash on quarts. Which you hardly get any of ingame. So all in all trash game that doesn't reward.
Re-rolled about 50x no 5‚òÜ no additional 4‚òÜ servants on top of the one guaranteed when summoning 10x. No way will i waste my time or money on a game with such criminally low drop rates.

"First open instant crash, second open instant request to send an email to somewhere I can't see. Overall doesn't work. LG K10"
Drop rate is Funking doodoo so don't waste money on the summons
I lost all of my save account I put in my password and username
"I enjoyed playing it for the first month or so. I leave the app alone, come back to it an apparently I can't play anymore. Saying that I have a weak connection or couldn't connect. I don't know how when I use wifi often."
"This game is great in almost every way, but if there's something that will ruin it for me, it the lack of a way to cancel your attacks in order to cast a Master Spell or use Command Seals. Once I open up my attack cards, I cannot go back, and I've lost multiple battles strictly because of that. I know this game is fairly new, but if this issue ever gets changed, it will be great improvement in the game itself."
Can we see some english voice acting like the cast from Fate/Zero?
That's hell your walking into.
"Gacha is a pain, but this game is fun."
It doesn't work for my LG
"If you want to play a game where you get heroes from a series you enjoy, this is not the game. Summons are so bogged down by billions of enhancement cards that can pulling a hero feels like a bloody miracle.   If you can get past that (I couldn't) the game is graphically beautiful and has a pretty enjoyable story."
A very good rpg
This game is not playable on Android phones I have a LG v20 and I downloaded it and went to go open the game and it says I have to email the game support for some stupid reason why do I have to do that if it's on the Play Store and ready to download if it won't let u even play the game
"I loved this game....until it completely froze and then it refused to load. I would open the application, get to the title screen, and it would go completely black and force close. Every single time. I'm pretty mad, seeing as how I completed all 3 arcs and was waiting on the new updates to be able to play okeanos. I wound up having to delete it and redownload it and now I'll have to make a new character because you guys didn't see fit to have a username and password in case something like this happened."
"As a person who has only heard and never seen anything relating to Fate, this game has honestly opened my eyes to an amazing and interesting series, and I'm more than happy to continue playing!"
Game crashes on launch. Submitted the crash report many times.
Have to have developer settings and usb debugging off to run. No thanks. Customer service is fast to reply  telling me why I cannot run this game but the solution is not reasonable to someone who needs those features. 1 star until these things are fixed and I can give a proper review.....
Games sends  me straight to email for support..... i get no response from support. Fix error 43 plz
I'm a fan of the anime the game entertained meüëçüëç
"Okay game at best, though drop rate on anything is so low it should be criminal and price to gain on purchases is plain highway robbery. Other than that the game is as stated prior, okay, the only fate game on the play store sadly."
"I just really like fate, and this game makes me love it more"
"Big anime company - poor game.  The game require internet at all time, yet theres no real online feature like co-op, raids, ladder, team, chat, trade, etc...just you grinding the same dungeon to max out your card. This game is like an Alpha built. Fate is a big and great anime, have so much potential."
doesn't open.
This is how Gacha games should be. Great for free to players.
Won't run on ZTE axon 7
I have no words to explain
"Initially I was off put by the lack of options, but this is Super Mega AWESOME! TOTALLY does justice to that amazing show."
I want saber and excalibur its so hard to get her its not hard ITS IMPOSSIBLE
Awesome gacha game
Fate fan favorite!
"great game, been waiting for it for some time. the only concern i have is when you need to transfer phones or reset the phone and you don't grab the transfer code. most games currently link to an account (google, facebook, etc) but you need to use a one time transfer code and if you forget to get it, expect to restart"
"I came here for GARcher, stayed for best kohai Mash. 10/10 would go back in time again."
MAKE MORE FATE GAMES
Most fun I've had with a mobile game
Eh.
"Loved the game since it's first released with the Jap edition, love it even more now that I can read it."
"I turned off the push notification, but it would keep sending notification despite the setting."
"Cool game but what seriously annoys me about these games is you have to go thru a 1000 hour tutorial before you can actually go to a menu and save! It's a mobile game, I don't want to have to do a million things before I can save my progress.."
I will never understand this game every time I play one or two battle I get sent to my home screen and its impossible for me to get saber with excalibur
"Amazing graphics and ,Great time killer"
The game is like a mix of Dokkan and tales of link. If you've got any experience playing those you will possibly enjoy this game.
"Terrible aspects, great idea with the game though,until the companies got greedy with the worst drop rates in the world of simular game types, not to mention the limitations on everything, even to deal with different class quests, etc, I understand this is a bigger company but still it's we the customers who should be heard..."
Niceu Niceu
"It's a fun game, great for fans of the fate series. Story is good, and translation is okay. People complain about gacha, but a 5* isn't necessary to progress. Most, if not all, servants are viable if used right. It's fine in jp, why change it here? Only problem is the low drop rates of mats which won't improve until the other maps are added, which will take awhile."
"Crashes on launch, then requests to email phone info."
Im a fan of the show and the game is awesome
"Great game love it, a bit grindy only negative"
It is a great game just don't lose your account cause customer service won't help u recover it
A must have for Fate series fans and newcomers.
"i love the fate series, however this game does no justice to it. In 4 minutes the game crashed 5 times. it lags horribly, the characters are poorly done combat wise as well. The story is decent but ehh its not worth the headach."
For a free game it's pretty good. It's got a good story and actually got me into the fate series. My only problem with it is that the multi summons with the saint quartz give you almost no heroic spirits and the ones you do get aren't that good. I've played a few games like this and the multi summons from them were more fair. What would be nice though would be more events that reward you with saint quartz. Like Nero fest except it was not very appealing to do at all. Overall I'd give this a 3 out of 5 stars.
This game is what i was looking for a must need for fans of fate/stay night
Will not even download past 59%
"Game is great, but needs to hurry up and update more frequently. The Japanese server has a couple years on this, so there is plenty of content, but we are currently still on the same content since release. It becomes so stagnant that doing daily dungeons and quests become more of a chore than it is fun. One short event doesn't help, and we don't even get a summer event while it was summer."
Keeps crashing when ever NP is used. Need to keep reopening game after crashes in hopes every load might be the one where the enemy gives me mercy and doesn't use it.
I do enjoy the game but my phone broke and I've already gotten rid of it. Is there any way to get my account back or am I out of luck?
One of my favorite game :)
"Just like a Fate series card game, if it were able to be accessed from multiple devices ala Hearthstone or Twitter it would be a 5 star"
"This is one of the few mobile RPG games that I enjoy. The combat system is fun and easy to learn, and the unique sprite designs and battle animations are greatly appreciated. The story is decent and full of scenes that made me chuckle. It takes a while to get through the tutorial and actually play the game, but everything after is fantastic. F:GO is a solid mobile game that fans of the series will really enjoy. 4/5."
"I'm utterly disgusted with the support from the this game. They give absolutely no helpful responses. When this game starts it immediately brings up an email support ticket saying it crashed. OVERALL: Terrible Support. Don't know about the game itself, I do enjoy the anime."
Nostalgic and fun!

Great game and Altera is the best
"Great game! Very fun gameplay and gorgeous graphics, especially for Noble Phantasms. Any fan of fate would love this game, although it can get pretty grindy."
"you guys ruined your own game because of jp. You show us every event they and then say we have to wait until next year? Why even play? I can just uninstall, and reinstall next year when summer hits. Or not. Why waste my time when other games do it right."
"I'm gonna say this for what I expected from this game it is surprisingly well written, i find myself playing almost more for the story then the game which isn't usual from phone games."
Summoning rates are pretty harsh
Just want to say that I'm a big fan of fate and this game and always love the good customer service that is provided by most Japanese games when it comes to down time of their games and want to give a shout out to the developers to make these games playable to everyone outside of Japan.
Designed to fleece you. No mid paid package. Expensive as is. Difference between paid and free paid items for summons... Questionable. Many cards you would think that should be 4 are 3 stars. Just meh. Graphics are good for a mobile. Storyline is eh. Not a fan of grand order. It took some of the shadowy background and made it into garbage. No PvP? Seriously. Just no. Heard from a friend that the US version is gutted versus Japanese version. Will not make the effort to verify this. Update* a few hundred into micro transactions and nothing of any use.
Boring but not bad.
Can't wait for more events
"Story is pretty lame. Draw pool is super tiny. 1% SSR rate is pretty low. Combat is boring. Menus are not intuitive and take far too long to learn to navigate. If you're not here because you're a die-hard Fate fan, why are you still here? 2 stars cause it's kind of pretty looking and I had no technical problems."
"Fantastic game for Fate fans, though it's been a long time coming. Still in it's early stages in NA, but there's a lot of content on the way. Interesting story and the gameplay is great, seeing all the different combinations of attacks from the different heroes. Lots of grinding involved and the gatcha has low rates for high star characters. But it is beatable without spending anything and even more rewarding when the luck occasionally comes around. The general exp is definitely worth the download, and I'm very excited for future events and updates."
"Play this for the community around it. Gameplay is fun and fair, gacha is harsh as per usual with these games, voice acting is godlike, but its the fate universe and the love the developers have for the game that sets it apart. There is so much official content outside the game itself, and theres always a big event going on or something to look forward to. It's well worth your time (and money, all of your money)"
Great game easy combat though I wish there was a bit more combat and less dialog.
Great game with top tier waifus that you have like a 1% chance of getting because GATCHA. 10 umus outa 10.
I think it was awesome
"Grammatical and typographical mistakes interfere with meaning. I don't know if series veterans already know what's going on, but as a newcomer that just likes gacha games, I don't have the same benefit, due in large part to the poor localization.   The localization, in turn, makes the story interminable, indecipherable, and surprisingly mundane despite the fantastic elements that are supposedly happening. It's the game equivalent of a Michael Bay movie; cool window dressing, but strangely, still boring."
Just play it people wouldn't hurt to try it......you might just fall in love with it ahah
"I have been waiting to play a Fate Game for some time, and after watching Grand Order i was excited to see the game. I had some trouble getting it working on the Galaxy S8 +. For those having issue getting it to work you need to have developer mode turned off, otherwise the game will crash and not load."
"I have actually been really enjoying this game. It's hard to get a five star but a lot of 3 star and lower characters perform really good and almost up to par with the 5 star in certain cases. The balancing makes it so you never feel like you can't win as a free 2 player.  In addition the story is pretty engaging, much more so then I would've expected from a mobile game. There are translation errors at times but it's still very much understandable. The gameplay is turn based but uses a card system and also let's you use skills in between each turn.  The graphics are also really nice to look at. And the character sprites have a lot of detail to them with more characters receiving sprite updates in the future adding detail and making their animations smoother  If you like fate or other gacha games (fire emblem heroes, granblue, bleach etc.) there's no reason to not give this a try"
The company  basically told me any issues i have are not their problem. Uninstalled and not looking back.
"I love this game, I give it 5 stars all around! The characters are drawn in many different art styles, making each one unique. It has a great story line, with choices and battles in between. You can fast forward the battles. I can wait to see the anime!"
The game is alright. It gets very laggy. I wouldnt recommend paying into this game though because the customer service was terrible.
I would probably enjoy it more if I could actually play. I keep running into the issue of it trying to send me to my own email to send an email of an error. One saying my mobile device is incapable of running the app because that app even with it still not being very old compared to its other versions is not compatible with my device.... so I wish I myself could give a better review. But I can not.
Fate/GrandOrder is a very good game.
The game does not open. It takes me to a gmail link saying the game is unnavailable to me
"Terrible gacha rate, but good story and art"
It  would crash every time I would play it and it would run slow.
"You cant stop the gaijin money from rolling in, Nasu, no matter how hard you try."
Great game and they help u with game bug very fast. I sent someone an email about I can't lunch the game and they reply with the fix in a few hours
"Game is very fun, lots to do and the story really grabs you and makes you want to keep going. Everything feels very confusing at first but once you start playing and doing things it's very smooth and feels good. I've been playing for a while and I'm not longer confused. Don't be daunted, give it a try!"
"One of the few mobile games I love. It plays nice, the story is interesting, and love the characters."
The gameplay ia fun and addicting. The story keeps you going. Its intereating learning about some of your favorite characters in the fate series. There is ton of content and always events to keep you playing. Very high replay value. There are some cons such as waiting for ap and rng factor of summoning rare servants you want. Also game tends crash once while. There are some rate up events which counter that also. Overall game is very fun and worth downloading. My favorite game played on iso I dont like mamy iso games in general and prefer pc so nice treat to find special one like this.
the app wouldnt even open. i would tap on the app then a white screen appeared then an error message after a couple seconds.
"Big fan of the fate/stay series, when this came out even more excited"
I can't play on Android version 4.4.2
I want the same version the Japanese have!  :'(
Im loving the game hope they add new and more content
Nice RPG
It's not working on my galaxy s7 edge don't know why please fix it I do wanna play it
Fantastic. I've sunk way more hours into this than I'm proud to admit. I've been neglecting console games for this.
its great loved it
Fights are ugly and the camera is disorienting. Looks like and is animated like a flash game from 2007. Just a cash grab using the Fate franchise.
"App won't launch, instant crash."
Hate to give it a low review but seeing it is unplayable on my phone that well exceeds all of the reqirements I can't give it a good one either. Hopefully they will work on the problems and I will be able to come back and give it a good one.
"It plays more like a visual novel with mobile game elements than a traditional mobile game, the graphics are good and the game play is easy to pick up.  If you are a fan of the Fate series or type-moon in general this game is a must. Even if you are not it is still worth checking out."
"Alright I'm giving this a 5 star rating, since I've been playing since the JP version. I'm a huge Nasuverse fan so this game makes me feel right at home. Everything is solid between the game controls to the music and story. The only thing that I can say is the rate need to be adjusted at least for the servant side of things a 1% chance of pulling a 5 star servant is crazy much less beating the 3% chance it will be a Craft essence instead. Also separate the pools fir servants and Craft Essence, people would buy both considering how the game is designed it is literally a chore to get through anything without decent support essences. This has been my main gripe even as a player of the JP version. Otherwise I love the game keep up the good work and try to push out content a little faster."
This game is an ok time waster and a pretty neat spin-off of the fate series
Would give it five stars if I could link it to Facebook or Google play. I don't like depending on a randomly generated transfer number to keep my account safe.
Good game story bit long and hard to get crystals seems to want you to buy them other wise lots of grinding
"This is more of an anime then a game.  I find the mechanics very convoluted and honestly quite boring.  There isn't any interesting challenges or strategy, it's just a grind-fest with pay to win mechanics allowing you to level easier.  I'm not sure why this game was recommended to me as similar to FE Heroes, it's nothing like it.  I recommend skipping this title."
Repetitive gameplay and choices in the story don't feel meaningful
It's awesome!!! üòÜ
All one star cause its not  working
It's kind of boring cause too... much loading
This is the best game even made on iPad Thanks  for  making  this  game
"Very awesome game! It draws you in from the first battle as you crave more! This game doesn't disappoint and for being a card game, it has no real sense of it even with leveling! Very impressive"
"Great graphics, gameplay and decent story. But summoning in this game is awful. The summoning pairs units and items, which makes you more likely to get an item rather than a unit. Forcing you to spend money. Skip this app."
I'd really love to have a better review but I can't! And it makes me sad being an avid fan of the fate series. The game won't work on the latest Android so I can't give a proper review!
"I love the game. I spent almost $100 on it and I just can't get any Servant above 3 stars. I have so many 5 star equip items, but nothing else. Later in the game it's almost like you require anything above a 3 star Servant. So I'm done with it."
Does not load on SG 8 +
"Worked fine for a few days and then I was hit with error code 60. Which is supposed to be a rooted android code. My device has not ever been rooted. Highly disappointed, I'm on galaxy S8."
"Nexus 6. Doesn't seem to work. Downloaded twice, click to open the game, screen rotates, then immediately opens my email to send a crash report."
"When I try to open the app, it asks to use pay pal. Smells like a scam."
"All I get is ""Fate Grand/Order is not playable under your environment"". I'm in the US. I can't find anything online for this."
If you love turn based rpgs and love the fate series then you will love this
"Good at first. Then during x10 summoning froze on the third character and force closed, and never gave me the rest. Instant dissatisfaction with the story and began skipping it all, its been out a while and there still isn't a fix for this? Nice."
Saber
Love the controls & RPG structure. Love the Fate series & its just a good game. Worth my redownload.
Everytime I open the app it takes closes it self and takes me to google mail app
Easy grind and best rpg game i ever played on a mobile phone.
Don't get me wrong I love Fate but this game takes way to long to load I have 4G network an just to get to 3% it's taken 4 hours........
"Can't open app. When I try to it's asks me if I want to ""complete action with: email, PayPal, etc"
Game is great for those who love the anime. The game is really gacha heavy however. Getting top tier units is hard unless you spend money. The game play and mechanics is lots of fun.
Get good
"The game is rather slow paced, the battle mechanics feel limited, The quest involve doing the same map several times in a row, and the saint quarts take a long time to build up and are over priced for a full 10 summons. Overall the game has potential, however in its current state, it is much too slow paced and limited. Things to consider would be making combat less random, lower the amount of times needed to compleat story quest, and slightly lower the cost to buy saint quarts. Another idea is auto battle if you want to keep the current battle style because it gets monotonous doing the same thing over and over."
Loading screens seem to be getting longer and longer.
Can't play the game yet but I know this game will be amazing just like the series
Best mobile game I've played So far
Played the Japanese version for a long time; loving this one too especially since it carries over the quality-of-life upgrades. Amazing game without any dumb autoplay function üëå
Altria? Who the hell is she? That name is TOO FAR from Arthur or Arthuria (*lol)
it's  pretty good I'm just having trouble with my transfer number
"The story is pretty engaging and the art is well done. The game is super grindy and the rates are low, but unlike most gacha games a lot of low rarity units are actually good. Great way to burn time."
They still haven't given me the ticket for the release of the movie and the 12 mil along with the other things you were supposed to get when you first started the game
Game won't load keeps telling me that I have no signal.
It's impossible to run the game. No matter what I do its just one error after another.
cannot run
I couldn't play the game
It is a great game with characters i know and love! This is what an anime based game should aspire to be.
Its really addictive and fun I love it
Another crappy game blocking root for no reason.
"I've been playing the Japanese version for a long time. To have this game in English is a God send, No, it is a miracle of the holy grail."
"Download time takes far too long, newer games have initial start up gives you the chance to play the game almost instantly by letting you download the game contents little by little as you progress thus making you decide whether to play or stop."
"It is a solid game if you are a Fate fan. My issue is that it demands too much off a lot of phones.   I would give it more stars once  They fix the crashing issue. An option to shut off battke animations may helo or turn off NP animations.   This game also needs more quests and ways to earn apples for AP restoration. If you somehow pull a good servant you can powerlevel events early on and get good AP (energy) early but after a while, harder quests will easy shortern your playtime to about 5 minutes every few hours. Not really a good thing.  The overlimit on AP when leveling is definitely something to praise since no other gatcha ive played does this and i believe it is absolutely fair and helps newbies tremendously.  Lastly we need to have a way to look at quest rewardd to see where we can get certain item drops like ascension materials so that farming isnt as confusing."
"Its an amazing game fun to play addicting and helps pass the time, reminds me.of chain chronicle but better"
This game raises the bar for fun for phones
I like  the game but one problem is too much lagging and little bit freezing...
It's an okay game but soon as you're done with the Rome chapter I guess you could call it that. it basically a standstill and gets real repetitive quickly so update it so we can continue the story
"Can't even open it. Takes me to the ""share via"" screen when I try to open it."
It looks fun
"A decent Montage game with one very large game ruining problem.  The draw are beyond player punishing.  Not only are they some of the worst in mobile gaming period (1% and 3% for the rares), but items are in the same pulls as the units.  The items have boosted rates, so guess what when you get that rare to pop it's likely an item.  Never spend on this game, you are better off just flushing your money down the toilet."
"Installed on Galaxy Note 5. When I attempt to launch the application it wont load and is instead asking me to continue with Email, Gmail, or PayPal. Idk what is going on but that seems shady."
Won't work on Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus
"Great game but the lottery system for acquiring servants can mess up an individual to shell put more cash. There is also a lack of ways to acquire a servant, for example, shouldn't there be a ritual summoning for a specific servant like using materials on plus a few saint quartz to summon a specific class servant based on the materials used. Instead it is heavily relied on 1 currency, but i guess that is how mobile games get the revenue."
Played th jp verison and this just as great.
Doesn't even boot up once on Galaxy s7
Very addicting! If you liked the series then you'll love this game. Has all the characters we grew to love and now we can play as them. I've been using the berserker Heracles and he's a beast as well as the archer Emiya. Can't wait to see who else I unlock
"Good game for type-moon fan, but it would be cooler if you guys increase rate up for 5 star char"
"If you like fate/stay series, this is awesome. I don't have to spend money to progress. Easy to start, hard to master."
Big Fate stay night fan. Love the art tho it does lack some stuff but I understand it's a new game the graphics and features will soon to be added right? Will 5 star for now x3
Failed to launch
Crashes on start for Nexus 6p.
"A resource hog cashgrab. The game itself isn't fun, and the random rolls for your favorite character? Total crapshoot. It's a waste of time even if you do get a good team"
Only complaint is low drop of good servants!
Amazing game can't wait for the future updates
The only flaw is that it kicks me out
A well-done game
"The story is very enjoyable and the graphics are good, the servant summoning is for me the only problem, the rates for a 4 or 5 star servant is 3 & 1% way too low plus you obtain more equipment from the roll then actual servants, if the percent can go up a bit more than I'd rate the game higher"
"Needs graphics options, phone frequently overheats due to the apps demands. Gameplay is grindy and boring."
Crashes immediately. Unplayable
"I spent five times longer staring at ""connecting"" screens and restarting after it became unresponsive than I did playing. Seemed really fun, but unplayable for me."
It's definitely for fate fans. Also rolling good servants is luck based. But as long you level up your 4-3 star servants you should be able to get though it really easily.
"Can't even play it.  I really liked the anime and wanted to give this a shot but as soon as the tutorial started the game crashed.  I hope this gets fix,  until then I can't write a proper review."
I like the story and the game plus it's videos on YouTube
I never got a ticket to summon a master like everyone of my friends did an its making me angry. I been waiting for 4 days an i still got nothing....  .
I can't play game on Android O....no other app I have used or download has this problem.
"Great game, and the customer support is amazing. These guys helped me get my account back after my tablet broke after an update. Top tier game with an amazing team."
Been playing the jp server and it was awesome now it is in english so much better
"Try to take any reviews here lower than 2 with a grain a salt. Most of it is usually being really salty with bad luck on gacha, not a viable excuse as you can get through the jp game using 1-3* servants and free 4* servants you are provided with in events as time passes.  Same for translations, some people forget that JP fate also had typos, which were fixed overtime. Same issue here in NA, they are fixing it as patches come with every update.  My only complaint and issue is them not just having one whole merged server with JP as most of the past players reside there. However, a new slate has established really well here despite some minority disagreements.  Fun game guys. ~"
"Couldn't even open it. Tried to, and it would close out and bring up a share option. Stupid."
It's just not for me
Love it. I'm so glad it finally came out in America
This this is a dating as f*** I love it
Best gacha game and best community. Join us guys. Share our salt together
Great art. Great voice acting. Decent game. This game is too much like any other FTP game. As it is set to be boring and grindy unless you are willing to open your wallet constantly. From quest that require 3+ play throughs at 10 ap a play to complete to no good way to collect evolution materials. This. Is. Not. Fun.
Love Fate.
Fun game with lots of historic and famous story characters
hmm very good tho
Overall a great game that is close to my heart. However there is a bug that closes the game randomly causing me to restart the app. This happens every 5 or 10 minutes. I hope this gets fixed in the next update.
"You run out of stamina too quick, but other than that it's a solid game."
"I may be somewhat biased due to watching Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, but I have enjoyed most of Fate/Grand Order. The game overall is good (aside from the animations). The tutorial does get annoying, but it doesn't last for the whole game."
Kill me (not really) ‚äô.‚äô
I am in love with the game.
"U will salt about the rate but all character is useful, game balance is well made"
it's a good game with very well written story and great art. the only complain is that the battle load time is rather long. hope they can improve on that.
"Fantastic for fans and newbs alike,"
Rate up is a lie. But the waifus are on point.
This game is a well put together mobile rpg. While there is online transactions the game can be enjoyed for free. A must pick up for any Fate or rpg fan.
Its fun it is not a cash grap unless you want specific servents or you want your waifu
All I ever get is craft essence
"The game is okay and the gacha is kinda fun, but enabling developer options this app to keep opening Gmail to send bug reports, making your phone completely useless. I had to uninstall and then reinstall it after I turned Dev options off, wasting my only allowed transfer."
"Fun game with beautiful sprite-work, easy to use battle system , and even more Canon story in the Nasuverse"
love the fate universe and this game!
"Not much to say, but it's amazing. I do hope that there will be more singularities coming out soon..."
Great game love it but keeps crashing every time it transitions to the next pair of enemies and sometimes it just crashes on the main menu can you please fix this so I can actually enjoy the game without all the crashes
This game is an all around amazing game. I have to say the games about as good as the Anime series it's based off of
Uhmm.... It is been good until the game keep automatically close
Low rating because the game refuses to launch on the Galaxy S8 SM-G950U
"Actual download size is 420mb.  Graphics are high quality, but just use puppet animation so it still looks&feels kinda cheap.  Battle system is pretty good, but acquiring new servants through a random lottery doesn't make narrative sense. Same with being forced to bring along another player's servant to help, and merging servants to level them up.  Story was very cool, I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to uncovering more of the plot.  Tutorial was far too railroading. Forcing you to press a particular button to advance."
Finally Going to Global used to play jp
I love the game. The graphics are good. The only issues are the summoning rates for servants and the game crashing frequently.
It was amazing how the story line keys with the show
It's okay.
"""Wassup, homie."" Best words from a 16th century queen."
"Won't work with us debug / dev mode on. My phone is mine, and some poor excuse for a developer isn't going to dictate what I can and can't do with it. Git gud."
1/10. Nothing like the Anime.  WHERE IS KIRITO AND ASUNA?
All I want is Broskander.
Very intricate detail put into the servants. Definitely worth a play even if you aren't familiar with the Fate series
Goty
I came from the past that saved 2017 for you NA plebs to play and WHERES MY MEDEA AND MEDUSA ANIMATION UPDATE
A fun game but the rates for pulling a servant are kind of low. Used over 100 crystals on the gilgamesh banner. Hardly got any servants. Only got crafts 99% of the time pretty much.
It is so cool
Game won't even open. It just crashes on a galaxy s7
Great game but they really need to raise the summon rate for servants vs craft essences. Pulled only 2 4 star servants and maybe 10 to 15 3 star ones. But pulled lots of 4 star and 4 5 star craft essences.
Installing this was fate.
Love everything about besides that the devs don't keep up.to date with the latest version of Android but don't list this in the description at all.
"Saber is best girl, fight me"
The game may be a gatcha he'll style game but it's very fun. No real useless servants and great artwork. With more content on the way I'm looking forward to it all
"Finally, its in english! Im so happy now that i can play the game AND understand the story!"
It's a great game to play and as a big fan of the Fate Series they are doing a amazing job
Great gameplay and waiting for update for the story
It good I'm glad it base on the fate series
Prefect
I've been waiting for this for so long...
"While the translation needs work, everything great about this Japanese game is still there and playable on my own phone now."
Thanks man the new update I can't play this game no more
Never thought I'd get to play this game and was so excited when I saw it in the store
"It got my friends into fate, I can't complain."
"Been a fan of fate since 2006, for a mobile game, it's pretty great"
The game is awesome i love the fate series alter saber was hard but i beat the king
"Fantastic game. First off the story is written by the team that made the visual novels+anime. the battle animation is beautiful, especially for feature servants like Saber or Emiya. +Avoids the pitfalls of mobile. Each servant is viable for the game, instead of having to pay for a 5* drop."
Great for Fate fans.
Waiting for new updates
Buttery
Love playing this game.  Broke my old phone that it was on.  Contacted their support praying that I could get my old saved data.  It only took a couple of days but I am back where I was at.  Awesome!
I love it!!! But the graphic to much excelent for android game üòÇ
"Good game play with the good story of fate series. Very good support team, Looking forward to more content. Keep the good work"
Great game love the app like of content out for new players as well as not to summoning  dependant unlike FE and everything is at your disposal without  to much pay to win aspects.
One of the best game that i ever played
Love the japanese version. High hopes for english.
"Everything I love from the Fate series with familiar faces and a great story, plus new friends to play along with. Addictive and engaging."
"To me, Fate/Grand Order doesn't feel like your typical mobile game.  It plays more like a Japanese Visual Novel with the expected accompanied rpg elements.  However what makes this a real gem is the engrossing story that is paced depending on the users playtime.  In otherwords, I feel like I'm driving the story, and that's a great feeling to have. It's a rare title among this massive sea of generic mobile games, and I wish more developers made titles like Fate/Grand Order."
Please improve the translations and grammar.
"Played it in Japanese, now I can understand the story"
I waited 4 this
"Great game, just no ssr."
I love the franchise and story overall the game is sublime but their are so many 4-5 stars but if you make the summon rates 1% everyone will be super mad this is not a good way of forcing people to spend money and it ruins the experience pls raise chance
Love the Fate franchise. Glad it's been brought to NA.
"I can't rate anything other than the programming of the app. Why? because it is too poorly engineered for me to even get to anything! On 3 different devices, the app either refuses to launch at all, refuses to connect to the server, or loses its connection every few minutes so that I can't even get past the intro sequence. This is NOT my internet connection.  I was looking forward to this game after all the hype. Very disappointing."
Great game! Just wish the 5* rates are better.
This game is cool for any anime fans
Awesome game. If you love the Fate series then you'll love this.
"Need to release worldwide. Said global in promotion, usa not global."
I would love to give this a proper review but every time I try to open this it crashes. Please fix this
"Its a great game, but waiting so long for an update is really annoying"
Refuses to run on my Google Nexus 6P
It's a good game and I really would like to see more characters is my only thing. But other than that it's a good game
I just wish that when I had played and wasn't in the middle of a battle that it wouldn't keep kicking me off the game and back to my phone screen. My other games don't do that so I don't know if it's a game issue that I hope is fixed I really love the fate series.
Bandwagonshit are pretty dumb they doesn't know what hell await for them in this game mostly of the complaints are all the rate up haha also they getting 3* CE and Servants that also useful but they are too much greedy doesn't mean you have a ssr your already powerful they are low rate servant that can surpass ssr but then I am happy about their complaints and disappointments
Still wont launch it on my LG phone with Android 7 it wants to load in as a email? Yet it boots up fine on my Samsung tablet. Please fix so I can play it on my phone.
"This game feels very archaic, the style and gameply feel old for even mobile, and the flair of your servants is very underwhelming. On top if this the gacha is the worst Ive experienced. Getting something useful outside of an event is impossible, and the gacha currency is slow to obtain. On top of this the equipment(essences) and unit(servants) rolls are in the same gacha leading to absolutely unwhelming pulls. What a poor old game for the Fate series."
"Overall a fine game, though the Ap system is a tad slow for my tastes, 1 every 5 minutes, and you get upwards of 100? It takes 12 hours before you can reasonably do anything again without spending real money... which is probably the point."
"Played for less then 5 minutes and already feel how badly made this game is.  Just another ""rushed"" product the content owner decided to dish out to milk more money"
"Polish the overall combat & character stats. There's no strategy to this game, the characters have two basic stats & it's a gatcha gambler too. Many of us were very optimistic about this game & us real gamers were let down as we usually are with ios/Android mobile games to be fair. The Fate/ Series is Great but this game is bearly a game imo. Maybe part two or v2.3 I'll come back to this but as it stands now in v1.10 this game sucks and i don't understand why you think we would want to invest our money into this. Thank You."
Great game for fate fans and casual players alike.
Spectacular and very addictive game
Cool man
"This is a very fun game, I'm glad it finely came to America!"
Fgo does a good job of letting you play in the setting and summoning your favorite servants.
"I love this game. But my two biggest issues with it, are the obviously rediculous gacha, and a certain part of the gameplay. Namely, there is no way to back out of the card selection screen. Otherwise, should the second gripe be fixxed, it would be 5 stars. I do not expect the gacha's chances to be increased, as it is only toeing the line of unreaaonability; not quite over it, despite being something of a grey zone.  Also, with this model of tablet, it's a general problem that applications can't be installed with the SD card mounted. Do not put reviews claiming you can't install it, when you have this model and have a SD card mounted. Just unmount it, install, then remount it. Ignore that it says there isn't enough space. Usualy, it's fine."
This is the peak gacha game. Play this and you don't need to play any others.
"I cant play this game at all in my mobile device. Wont launch at all. Whenever i start it, it prompts me to send an email to devs cause it cant launch on my device"
It's got a great story. Simple yet addictive !
"Great game but it randomly crashes on my samsung galaxy tab 3, i would love to play more of it :("
Its an awesome game i love the story and everything but i wish that you dub the voices in english because i hate the japanese voice actors.
I love all of it ^o^
this game has some odd issue when it comes to running on my Samsung galaxy s8 + even when im not using it for some reason its having strange errors it even made the device maintenance app on my phone go from blue to yellow which also said it was slowing down my phone and i found out that it was from tapping the fix now on the yellow version on device maintenance and it really helped my phone afterwards when it came to running every other app i have on it aside from that whenever i restart my phone at times i will get a message saying it stopped working just as soon as i unlock my phone in other words i didnt even have the app running and i still got that message
This game makes me feel terrible but in a good way.
After playing i lost my saving...
Love the game and love the franchise. Well executed!
Love it. No complaints. Works great and has great characters. Glad this finally got it's western release.
"Game is nice and easy, rerolling characters is totally worth it, got 2 5 stars in a few tries"
"Its fun it just has alot of bugs, for example it constantly crashes like every 10 minutes. Secondly it automatically fast fowards on story dialogue and skips it. Thirdly it is difficult and time consuming to level up heroes. The apps great if you have a newer device."
"I would give a better review but whenever I try to open the app, it brings me to gmail and says its not playable under my playing environment. What do you guys mean by that?????"
I really want to like this. The real money cost of summoning currency is crazy. $1.50-$3 per summon depending on the bulk discount. Enemy servants are way op. Exp curves for your servants are steep.
"Probably a good game, but technical issues and unresolved bugs made it unplayable for me.  Definitely needs some work."
It's a really good game the noble phantoms are great and the servants are awesome but it needs more material to level up the servants and needs to fix the lagging a little buy besides that great game
"Gameplay is good. Graphics are wonderful. Drop rates are horrible, really horrible. When they say higher chance, they meant higher chance for them to earn more money. I love the Fate series don't get me wrong and I would like to donate to keep them going and what not, but not to this game anymore. Going back to play Fallen Princess."
It is a good game.
I love the character designs an the gameplay is pretty good
I just downloaded it and tells me it's not Play mobile for me to used
Help whenever I try to run the game it tells me developer mode is on (error 43) and when I turn it off and run the game shows same error what do I do?
Game is fixed. Now working and loving it. NOW SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Addicting gameplay
"Drop rates are abysmal even with ""increased chances"" and the game runs somewhat slow.  Tutorial takes way too long if you've already done it.  I'm uninstalling now after seeing how drop rates were before I get addicted to frustration."
"Its a a good game , I'm just wating for the next chapter to be playable"
Omg did not show girl or boy so had to wait 10 hours
I lost my account because the transfer don't work so anyone who plays this don't download
I just installed the game and it won't even launch
Awesome game but have very very very slow loading
"Fate Grand Order is a game that needs a ton of rerolls if you're not lucky and get a good Servant. The gameplay is neat, but everything takes too long to load and the fights feel anticlimactic because there is not really a time limit. And for rerolls, restarting the game just once takes around 5 minutes because of the additional files you need to download when you start the app after downlading it. In conclusion, the game is really good, only the speed of it should be increased."
FINALLY!!!!!!!!
"Great Game Overall, my only critique is that i would think having three of your own servants instead of 2 and 1 Friend would be much more enjoyable"
So I really like this game and i love the fate franchise.The gameplay is spot on and fun. The noble phantasms are awesome. But the gatcha is absolutely terrible. Just today i spent $80USD and got absolutely Nothing of value. Not even a single 4star servant. I will likely continue to play this game but I will NEVER spend any more money on it. The drop rates are the most garbage in any mobile game ive played. The amount of salt that I have over my purchase and lack of value is far too much to say that this is a good game overall.
"Cant even get it to launch after install. Like, cmon."
ËÅñÊùØÂ∞áÊúÉÊòØÊàëÁöÑÊâÄÊúâÁâ©ÔºåÂô∂ÂìàÂìàÂìà
"This game is disrespectful. It does not value time spent playing. Material faming is a joke. Summon rate is atrocious at 1% chance to get an SSR. Quartz is too expensive. They don't even give us 1 quartz a day, just every other blue moon. You won't really get anywhere unless you sell your soul to Satan just to get rich and buy quartz and have 1% chance of pulling something good. I have a ton of craft essence which is really getting old at this point and so few servants to use them on. Devs are greedy AF. The game is trickled to the brink of being unplayable if you don't pony up. Could have been a very good game, sadly the devs are full of themselves. I say skip this if you're not a billionaire. Or just play the fate stay night hentai game, at least that one is actually satisfying and you get to see the characters getting it on with each other."
Great game i love how much depth and design they put in great work aniplex
Downloaded it yesterday and still won't go past the loading screen. Finally gave up and uninstalled. What a shame.
Everything is just amazing in my opinion.
I don't usually game on my phone but this both addictive and fun.
"cannot display some character correctly, please fix it."
It's Gr8
Great for any Fate fan!!!
Too much talking not enough Gameplay... Need to reduce cutscenes and increase gameplay... First 30 minutes in was nothing but talking. Before every mission there's a cutscenes as well as after every mission...
So slow! Loading is ridiculous
"Good game, slightly addictive. Some controls could be better. Overall 4/5"
Little bit of a lag when Noble phantasm was being used but other than this app is what i recommend
"Everything got erased. My heroes. My essence, everything, gone. I was doing a servant summon, just recieved a lancelot which i was happy about, game crashed on me amd when i opened it again, everthing was gone. Lost my lvl 28 heracles. My level 36 Elizabeth bathory. Not happy. Will change rating after this is corrected."
Fantastic and amazing
"It's a fun game, but the 1% rates are absolute trash."
What kinda weeb garbage is this
"Hell of a lot of fun. I haven't played a mobile game in years, but FATE made me try it out."
"This is a really great game, but the main problem is that it is always crashing and force closing on my phone. Please fix this issue."
Great game for lovers of Fate stay night
"Nice game,  but the gacha is hard to get the rare one"
"Overall, the game is amazing! The only problem is its a little short currently, and after you finish the singularities that have been released, you can't get anymore gems except through the login or if you buy them, which makes it hard to do the summons and get new characters to prepare for chapter 3."
Intel CPU not supported and rooted phone. I'm done.
Amazing game needs to add units from japan quicker besides that its a good game
"I really liked it in the beginning, but now i cant even log in and the rate to pull servants is piss poor...unless ur super lucky. Cant log in cuz it crashes. About to uninstall."
"I'm a big fan of the anime so when I saw this I had to try it and love the story, gameplay is unique and most of all I get to play as my favorite character's from the anime and new ones from the game so I give this 5 stars"
This game is awesome needs more loli characters ‚ô°
Doesn't work for nexus6 so rip
Love everything about it so far!
Waifus and Husbandos
I'm a fan of the Fate franchise and RPG. So if you combine these two together you get an amazing app that you just can't put down.
Really buggy! I can't type anything because the keyboard won't stay open.
Make sure usb debugging is off
I can't play it. It keeps giving me an error code saying I can't play with my phone's environment.
"It still loads a bit slow sometimes, but it is alot of fun."
Doesn't work on my samsung tab s2
Does not work for Galaxy s6 edge
"A surpringly awesome game. It has a large amount of servants, equips, customization, and missions. I have yet to hit any form of pay wall since the vast majority of content is easily earned freely in quests."
Its a great mobile game adaptation of the fate universe
the game is amazing very fun gameplay the 5 star rates are really low though
It's one of the best app games I've played and a great stepping stone to help make the fate series grow even more
"Slow paced let down. I expected a bit more from this one, considering how it was hyped from some friends. Sadly, it was slow, buggy, and honestly very boring. Not for me."
"If you're into VN's and like RPGs, this games for you. It's an added bonus if you love the Fate Series too. But be warned, you can spend money on this game fast."
I cant get in the game. The game crashes as soon as I open it.
Abysmally low drop rates for a game that expects to have your favorite servants as 5 star only pulls
"Doesn't work on LG v20, keeps opening my PayPal app and that's it, literally unplayable."
"It's a quaint time waster of a game, but overall it lacks any real end game. The game is stunningly beautiful, and is very addicting, but it really just falls short.  The Gatcha summons for 4/5 stars are shared with equippable craft essence, so if you want to summon the high tier servants, be prepared to reroll or drop money. The drop rates for the servants themselves are bad enough, so its just insulting to pull 3 of the same servant in one 10-roll.  The servants themselves don't really matter (at this moment). Because as long as you have a 4 star servant decently leveled, you can progress through the game using friend support alone.  There is no PVP, so there's not really much options to play beyond the story.  Leveling a unit is basically a grindfest. You have to play certain daily quests for drops of exp to synthesize with your unit. Problem is getting to higher levels require ridiculous amounts. If the game would give exp after quests it'd be bearable.  Overall, fun game, but atm nothing to invest heavily on."
"Overall the game is well adapted. The graphics are decent enough without being to the point of lagging down the game. Also  the game play itself is very enjoyable for those that like turn based combat.   However the main issue with the game is that once you press the blue battle start button for attacking, you cannot go back to it until the next turn, which is inconvient for those that may want to activate skills they forgot to.   Besides that, well done"
"Laggy but playable, really like it."
The game didn't load on my OnePlus Two.
Pretty decent app
Good game but it auto close and slow loading time
Great but be nice if it used the whole screen on S8 and similar long screens
The game Does not load on my Samsung Galaxy S4. It Instantly brings me to the error code email. I wouldn't mind it too much if it wasn't just me but this game is known to work well on S4's so I'm confused and angry. It says that  have Usb debugging on but I have never had that on so when I turn it on and off it still says I have it on......üò†
They need to change the drop rate for the NA market. 1% chance to roll a 5 star?
could not play game won't load
"Very nice game based off of the Fate series. Gameplay is not super deep, and the graphics are not mind blowing, but it has quite an extensive story, and lots of cool characters to collect."
The game doesn't open
"Great graphics. Hate the never ending cut scene at the beginning. The game play seemed simple and a bit drawn out. But the cut scenes were so bad I just uninstalled the game. You can skip it but if you have to skip story just to keep interest, it's too much."
"I signed up for the original release a couple years back and was never able to play due the app store stuff, but now it's English release, I love it! Game preformence wise is great, graphic wise could be a bit better, maybe 2 -D characters on a 3-D background of sorts idk, story wise  it's pretty amazing üòÇ"
"Really a fun game, have got lots of cool servants, don't have to get all the four, and five star guys, can get through game with strategy, unlike others where 4 and 5 star guys are required to power through."
"Error 43, Error 60, Error 92, Error Error Error. If I have to choose between doing what I wish with my phone and playing a gacha game, I know what I'm choosing. I'll stick with Granblue Fantasy."
"Won't even start. Click to start the app, screen flashes white like it's loading up, then instantly crashes after a second. Restarted my phone and app and did all the normal fixes"
Best graphics and amazing game
"Great game, finally get to play it in English which makes it better! Though it would be nice of they made the gacha better."
Awsome tactics and is awsome that you can summon allot of servants
I just F love the game so much
Great game. However the na version doesn't get the awesome training fields like they do in Japan. It is almost impossible to get the golden monument drops and other Ascension items to ascend your servants. Plz share the wealth here in na D:
Game doesn't work on galaxy S7
"Would be nice if i could play it. Downloaded it again after a couple weeks, and same issue game crashes right after i tap the app. Let me know when this game is fully functional and maybe ill come back."
i love anime
Push notifications wont turn off -.-
It is very good just waiting for it to be updated that's it.
"I love 5his game. The only problem being that it is taking forever for the Okeanos chapter to start and people need the quartz, otherwise we cannot roll in the awesome event. Please fix this."
"Some of the most fun I've ever had playing a mobile game. I can't speak for how it holds up to the original JP release, but I adore FGO. I've been taking my time to savor the experience. The game play is fun, easy to pick up but challenging and rewarding to master, deeper than it first appears, and every character is unique and lovable. It DOES require some previous knowledge of the Fate franchise before you play, in my opinion, but as someone whose knowledge is limited to the original VN and Fate/Zero, it did a good job of making characters from Apocrypha, Extra, and etc. Understandable and fun to watch. All in all, I would recommend. Whether you casually farm daily quests and summon or sit down and dedicate your time to the story missions, I find it to be a fun experience."
"Awesome game but every time I play it, after awhile, the game exits out. Why? Please help fix this."
Get error message on the OnePlus 3
"Honestly everything is good except for the rates. As a free to play gamer, it is nearly impossible to get ANY 5 star character you want without reinstalling many times.  I am currently reinstalling as I write this and it is frustrating.  I may have wanted to spend money on this game but seeing how the rates are, I am not going to throw money down a black hole."
"The devs have decided to make this game extremely picky about the kind of environment it can be played on. By that I mean it has QUITE a few specific error codes that crash the game if your phone is rooted, or if you even have USB debugging on! I understand this is to reduce likelihood of hackers but it's just picky over such common things that make it extremely annoying.   And good luck if it mistakenly throws you error codes. Then there is literally nothing you can do. You can't play, period."
Good games
"It's a really fun and nostalgic game. My only complaint is the horrendous chance of getting a 4 star or higher servant. All of my guaranteed 4 stars so far have been crafting essence, which I have quite enough of at this point. This game would easily be 5 stars if the rates rates were at least a little better."
"I've  been waiting for an English version for a while now but now that I downloaded it, I keep getting kicked out... I'm pretty bummed by it"
Error 500 popping up
This game is amazing! As a fan of the Fate franchise I'm very pleased with the new story & characters.
"This game is fantastic! It's the best mobile rpg, hands down!!!"
Absolutely wonderful for the fate series fan. I remember this coming out and me playing the jap version a while ago and reading the translations online in parallel. Absolutely great now that it's in English
This game exceedee all expectations. Being a fan of the FSN series my heart is in love with this game and i truly am enjoying every minute of playing it. The story is fun the processes for characters are fun and im always excited tobuse the quarts summon to see who i get next. This game is marvelous and lets me enjoy my very own holy grail war. Thanks Aniplex!!!
Awesome game. I am gonna watch the anime later today.
Can't play the damn thing. I'm on Android 6.0.1 and using Samsung Galaxy 7j....so yeah...and all my apps are up to date and I'm usinga WiFi I also I did a fresh install of the app and still did not work. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This game has been more enjoyable than plenty of console games I've played. Very addicting and it's great for fans of the series!
We'll I can't  open the app it's broken fix ur game I can any hard core high quality  games on my tab A but not this. Fix it later
Constant Crashing on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and that kills the fun. The crashes make battles harder then they should be. Other then that it is a good game though missing alot of the stuff the japanese version has hopefully it wont take a year to bring it up to speed with it. So for a Fate fan its great if your device can play it.
"Game is bogged down, takes forever to load anything.  Graphics are decent, but not to a point that should effect performance.  The method of getting new heroes is such a pathetically small rate.  Overall a massive disappointment for fate/stay night fans."
It's fun and a good time killer
Requires you to  unroot.
The loading time is so slow its pathetic
"What I like on this game is the story. The game play is standard. I will not play this game if this game doesn't use fate series character. And I play this game because of watched the movie, and now i want to know about the next story :). Note: I will never buy the quartz anymore, I have 150 quartz and only got two 4* heroes and too many 4* craft essences. It's all about lucky, and thanks to some awesome heroes from my friendlist, haha. Overall, this game attract my heart. :D Well, I would stop to play this game if I didn't get 5* servant for the next 60 SQ."
"Great game, but I didn't bind my account, which is a problem since it means I cannot recover that account at the moment. Is there a way to recover an account?"
The game is incredibly addicting and fun. Truly a game to play at your leisure. Btw micro-transactions aren't necessary in order to have fun.
"Personally, one of the best RPG centered games on the play store. Thriving story and great selection of characters. FGO is also a game that can be easily enjoyed with a vast amount of characters. This game rewards the player quite often. Great game!"
"How can a phone game possibly crash this much. I have to reload the same fight sometimes upwards of 10 times because of the ridiculous crashing, and waiting through the 1 minute+ startup every time is torture. If you have a phone that's more than 2-3 years old, you can't possibly have fun with this game."
BESSSSSST
Can't even open the game after install constantly restarts after a white screen. Brings up a constant do you want to open with PayPal or Gmail screen when I open the app the second time
Great fun
Really fun and interesting game
"Last update broke it, was a fun game before that"
The game needs alot of problems fixed. I would love to be able to play... but if the problems don't get fixed soon I will Uninstall it and never try it again.
Played the Japanese version so I love this game already glade it's in English now
"Love FATE, didn't love this game. Could have been so much better :/"
"Since the recent update, i have not been able to play at all. Im am either getting an error code on the main menu or it cant connect at all. I have emailed support but have yet to get a reply!"
Great game now that it is released and running for a bit now. Truly free to play and fun.
Can't even play because it says I can't connect to the servers.
"The Gatcha is a harsh mistress, but the game shows a lot of promise! The Visual Novel/RPG hybrid has a huge story and deep mechanics, and even lower-rarity characters shine. There isn't really any pay2win, but plenty of pay2waifu with low rates on high-rarity characters. Worth the lomg-term investment to start playing forever!"
Super fun
i wouldve rated fgo 5* but that was until this update. somehow they screwed the pooch. after i updated i couldnt get on my game and it wants me to start ovet. im now getting rid of this game bc im NOT going through all of this again. i was already in love w the fate series b4 and thankfully still am. though fgo and aniplex have seriously disappointed me by screwing me over.
It says I can't play it in my environment what ever that means.
"Worked until last update, now just stuck on a quest screen asking you to select a party but not letting you do anything."
Redirects to email or Gmail nothing else.
As someone who played on the JP version. I think its doing well
It's nice and easy to play
"Game is very solid, but the low AP early on plus the slow recharge combined with the absurdly low drop rate on decent servants keeps me from spending more time on this game than I am.  When my friends have multiple 5* servants and I'm struggling with a 3* and a 4* as my best with not one good drop from the summon system, it really sours my experience. Why spend money on more chances when the drop rate has given me a middle finger thus far?"
Some issues here and there but it's pretty good. How can I contact support?
Any fan of the Fate franchise will love this game. As a free player it's also very balance in regards of pay to win
The game crashes every time i try to open it.
"Great graphics and a pretty decent story for a mobile game, but the gameplay itself... The battle system is so dull, I can only play in short bursts before the game becomes too tedious to continue."
"It's a fun game to play i really enjoy it. Its bit of a hassle that each transfer number only works for that account once before you have to get another , but its better then having to start over entirely"
Love it so much it's really fun and addicting though I have bad luck in summoning but still awesome
I'm having terrible luck with the summons but I still find this game incredible fun.
"the game keeps closing out on me on its own so i can't keep playing the game it does this every couple minutes plz fix this and I'll easily change this to a five star and now that is to the update it is happening even more than before please i beg u fix this, this game looks so good but it keeps closing on me every couple seconds"
The game wouldant load for me even tho the update says it fixed bugs it just DIDNT!!! LIKE MY GOD!!
Server issues but it functions when it functions
"I'm only rating four stars because the full game isn't implemented yet, when the third singularity and up are implemented, I will give it five stars"
Will not run on my Pixel. Crashes at launch.
"It's a great game. But turn on USB debugging because you want to give an app some permissions to track wakelocks, and this app throws a fit. Took me about 5 minutes to stop the app from running because it keeps restarting itself after closing, but because I enabled USB debugging, it keeps throwing error messages in Gmail and kept redirecting me to the Gmail app repeatedly. This shouldn't be an issue on any app."
"I've been waiting for this game to come to global for quite a long time, so thanks Aniplex Inc. for your hard work. This game is amazing and I can't wait for global vers. to reach the point where the japan vers. is now, although the the gacha rates for 5 and 4 stars are pretty low, I don't really mind since I've played many summoning games before, and this'll be the first app game I'll be spending lots of money on, so I hope you continue making the game better, and again, thanks for your hard work"
Too low rates. Too low to spend money on. Will reconsider if rates improve. FE Hero's at the very least has 3% increasing. Not 1% flat and F.U
"It's a wonderful game! Addictive and fun! The only reason it's missing a star from me is due to the fact that, I have terrible luck and can't stand the drasticly low chances of pulling a 4* + Servant.."
It definitely appeals to anyone who likes the fate universe and is also an entertaining mobile game
It's really bug on wifi. Certain events can't be entered. Pressing back causes app to close rather return to the main screen. Needs better connection performance.
Wont run on verizon note 5
ive sold my soul to this
"It's a great game with fun characters. It's just keeps saying ""Connection Lost: Retry?"" I do retry but it's not working. Help?"
Good game just wish the 5 star summons had a higher drop chance
"Obvious translation errors. Worst gacha draw rates I've seen in NA market. Transfer code system is archaic; bind to an email, cloud save, or other means"
Thank you for fixing the issue the game is terrific.
Thank you for finally bringing this out in English and letting us play this game. It's has lived up to my expectations in every way.
Really entertaining with all my favorite servants! Excited to see what's next.
"I absolutely love this game, it's awesome. The only problem is that there isn't enough characters! Need to add more fast because it gets boring playing with the same characters after a while but great game with a bright future."
"I love the game because of the fate/stay franchise and the game itself is almost a new show, but I'm worried about how they are going to keep updating and making the game fun and interesting in the future."
"If not for the gacha hell, it would be perfect. RIP wallet"
"In case there is anyone having trouble playing the game: please turn of developer mode as the game won't start until that is turned off. Also rooted devices won't be able to play it, purpose of this is because of anti hack and cheat. This was in japan as well so Delight Works decided to do this.  Else l, the reason why we can't play the fame is because it's currently under maintenance."
Great game for fans of the anime
downloaded this waste of time and got an error and sent to my email SCREW THIS GARBAGE GAME!!
Is the fact that this actually has a story to it and not just a cheap mobile game is why this is getting five-star
An amazing game
"Literally slaughters your battery, but fun no less."
Best gacha game by a mile
"Longtime player of the Japanese release. Thank you for bringing FGO to English!  The English launch had some (very) small issues, most of which have been entirely fixed. Excited to help new players!"
I'm a huge fan of the fate series so I'm happy this is finally out in English! The gameplay is simple and the graphics are really nice. I do however take issue with the drop rate of 1% for 5 star servants. It's absurdly low and I keep getting duplicates of the same characters and have more rare essences than servants. I hope this is made better cause it is VEXING. Even still it is great game to play with plenty of challenge.
This is why I love the Fate/ series
Game is great but incompatible with andriod o. Can you add compatibility so I could play again
It just asks what application do I want to launch this in?  There's is no game?
Draw dropping amazing!
Ive recently lost an account because i forgot to reissue code and lemme tell you the support for FGO is god awful
I love the game only one thing it's practically impossible to get a 5 star character or higher because of crafting essences i honestly believe you should seriously make a separate summoning for crafiting essences so it's easier to get better characters otherwise it becomes  a pay to win game
"Gets an automatic 1 star from me due to their restrictions on rooted/jailbroken devices or devices that are on custom operating systems. If you have a rooted device or even an unrooted device running anything else besides a stock firmware, you will not be able to play this game.   It saddens me to see a game developer that would sooner write off an entire demographic of possible customers simply because they are either incapable or just too damn lazy to secure and protect their game from hackers/cheaters."
Gives an error and fails to open if your device is rooted or has an unlocked bootloader.
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
game is very slow crashes a lot
If ur a fan then just try it :D
Awesome game play love the fate series I love saber she my favorite character from the series you should give people ultra rare items for great reviews just a idea
FC on my Google pixel.
"As a longtime JP player and avid Type-Moon fan I was simply ecstatic when they revealed that this game was getting localized. I'm not really bothered by the translation. (You have to remember that this game was a niche title in Japan as well) They did the translation pretty well. I was expecting the usual machine-like apathetic kind. But they actually added life to the characters (W-whassup my homies!). The script was pretty confusing even in Japanese, so you can tell that the translators had the odds against them, but they did the best they could. All in all it's a solid localization. Can't wait for the upcoming events"
Been playing since the original JP server. Is kinda slow right now but once Halloween event hits the game will be faster and more fun. People make a data transfer code if you want to transfer across devices if you don't you'll lose your account. If you lose your account contact fate_go English account recovery and fill out the form to get you account back if lost.
Fun but kind of messy. Why even have a type/weakness if you can just throw an evade skill and completely avoid everything? Small things like that are what made me ultimately give up on this game. (and many others like it)
"Fantastic game. Good story, good combat system etc. My only complaint is the drop rate for 5 star servants is only 1% which is insanely low considering how long it takes to acquire the needed currency to summon at all. Even so, top marks."
Ok I would give it full 5 stars but omg the tutorial doesn't hold your hand it forces it. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a game forces you to do what it wants for a long time. It riped me out of the experience and made it so that I could not finish the tutorial in one go. It became more of a chore that I'd come back to. Once you get to the actual game though it's an amazing game.
"If the game immediately crashes and you get error code 43, make sure USB debugging is disabled from the developer console."
"Great game for fans of the Fate series! Summon rates are HARSH for 5 star servants, though (1%).  Wish it had PvP, or some sort of cooperative content. Maybe some sort of raid system or two guilds compete to be a boss faster than the other. I don't know but great game for what it is. Just needs another mode that allows players to interact with one another."
Always wanted an app icon that brings me to my home screen after 5 seconds!! Thanks!!!
"Great game over all, I just hope they'll add more servants and events."
Error code couldn't play on Nexus 6p
Its so cool and i really love the anime and game.
Tried re-downloading and starting up app. Error 43. I'm sure I am not the only one with this problem. Would rather put a no star but can't. Been a week ago now since English release.
I would  give  it a accurate  review if I could  get  it to install . Ever time I try to  I get  a   message  saying  that  I don't  have  enough  space. I have   nearly   5gb  of  free  storage  and  it won't  install .
This is my Dream Game!!!!!
"Overall I am really loving the game.  I can overlook the translation errors,  and going into this I already knew about the pull rates so as salty as it can be it is what it is.  I've been a huge fan of the fate series for a long time now, and am extatic that I can now not only play but understand the game.  I'm sorry some people feel like the translation is horrible and game breaking, or the people not happy about the pull rates being so low.  I feel at least in my opinion it can be looked past because it's a very fun game I look forward to the great events heading our way, and expanding story."
Pretty good game although leveling up Servants in the beginning feels really slow.
Game won't load.
"All right this is what i have been waiting for. You guys should make it so we can by certain characters. Of course for me it will be rider aka meduse or saber aka aruther version. The main problems with the game is the taxing load times, also the very very low gacha. All i get is essance cards when i do get a servant card its always a 3 low level star even when i use the 30x summon. This should be fixed"
Doesn't run.
Unplayable. Attempting to open it freezes my phone for a second then it opens up an email with an error message attached
Crashes when launched
Just slow and messy
It drains my phone's battery to fast.
It gets 1 star until the bugs get fixed and I can open the game
Couldn't play under these conditions. Forced generation of email on startup.
Cool games
"For some reason, I can't get it to start on my LG G6. Any help? Low rating cause i can't start it."
"Can't even get the game to launch, it says error 43 but nothing else. I read that it might have to do with phone being jail broken but mine is not please fix I really love the fate series"
Good casual game. However it's pay2win if you are hardcore gamer.
"I was really excited to play this game but I cant even get the game to launch. When I try to start it up I'll get  a quick white screen, and then it'll go to my gmail acc. saying that I can't play it and it wants me to send this error code to the support email. The code is an error 43 and I don't know how to address the issue."
Great game! A must have for fans of the fate series.
"App won't open. And from the other reviews I can tell I won't enjoy it even if I could, due to the bad localization. Will be waiting for them to roll in the updates."
"An all-around quality game, especially for mobile: Good story, graphics, sound, and gameplay. It isn't even ""Pay 2 Win"", as while getting 5 star servants is definitely immensely satisfying, 3-4 star servants are definitely still powerful on their own."
"Overall the game is fun. Scoring 3 stars due to the fact that there is no support to play across multiple devices. There is the option to transfer save data to another device, but you can only do this once, ONCE. You would think with today's technology that some type of cloud saving would be used."
cant play the game on OnePlus2 phone
I have been waiting for this game to come out since it was announced it was coming out in the US.  It did not disappoint.  My favorite part is the story.  It gave a very good reason for summoning servants and fighting with them.  I like how you can choose what you want to say.  I have never seen something like that in a mobile game like this before.
"Tried installing and playing it. It just wants me to send you an email as to why it won't work. I did that, but if you can't make a working product you'll never see my business. Uninstalling now."
"As a player who played the Japanese version, I know this game is great. But the English really needs some more proofreading. There are so many typos, mistakes and grammar errors. It makes me doubt if there is no actual proofreading team working. Hope things can be better in next update."
"I would really like to start play this game and spend a bit of fortune in it but, I restarted like 20 times w/o 5* so.. u just lost a customer :)"
It's fun and addicting.
One of my favorite amine series gets a great mobile game in the U.S.
Ty so much for English bb
"I love the Fate series,so I found this game and I love the game too"
Can't play because game says my device (pixel) isnt supported. Sitting next to my friend who's playing on a pixel. So sad.
the holy waifu wars have begun!
I'm pretty far in the Japanese version so I'll pass on this one for now.
"Couldn't start the game. I do not have developer options enabled and my phone is not rooted. I'm at Anime expo and I demand to play this game now. Five stars if fixed by the end of AX. If not, 1 star forever."
Fun game especially if you love the fate series
Finally they released a English version
I can't even play it says error code 60 but my phones not even rooted and Dev options are not enabled please fix!!!!
Best anime game ever 2017
"The story, characters and graphics are fantastic. Every Fate fan would enjoy this game."
Wish it could be played offline too if i dont got too good of a connection
Truly a great mobage game.  Still needs a little work but this is definitely the best one I've played to date.
For fans totally
Been waiting for an English fate go and it's finally here! If you are a fate fan then this is a must have
Great game so far ‚ù§ lots of fun!
Awesome i just wished theres was bit more free content
Runs well and plays on my phone and just love the characters back story and also the designing is beautiful
Can't open because error talking about my playing environment
Very laggy and drains battery fast.  Only runs at 26 fps with countless frame drops. Please consider fixing these issues.
"The game would be great but there seems to be long loading times, which kinda kills the momentum after a while."
Error codes before even able to play the game? Pass
I have to set up a transfer data every time? I just lost the second account!! I hope to god google will allow refund with what I just spent because this is unfair. Please help with retrieving my data please or the 109$ I spent on your game not too long ago basically disapeared
This game if fun. But one thing is missing LANCER HAVE TO BE MORE RANK BECUSE HES A IMMORTAL
Great game love the gaphics and i have been a fan if the series. This game is very easy to play and fun to do so.
Amazing Game Localization needs to be fixed though in later patch
This is a game we needed. Amazing
Must-play if you're a fan of the Fate series or Type-Moon in general.  Start your waifu collection now!
As a fan of the fate series this game is pretty amazing
"This game is awesome,great graphics,awesome art,addictive,great story.probably the best game on iOS.I love it"
God I been waiting for this
won't even start. error code 60 and I meet all requirements to play this (2gb ram and android 4.1 or higher) please tell me what's going on.
"Couldn't run.  Based on other reviews,  it's because I have USB debugging/dev tools on. Not turning it off for a game."
Any one dropping less then 5star is a Jerk. This is a phenominal title import.
"Can't play because phone is rooted. Even tried to unroot and unable to play. Shame seems like a good game, but are losing a lot of potential players and customers with stupid barriers like this."
Finally it is out in America I was tired of playing it in japanese this game is entertaining and it has fun events every once in a while also a nice story to keep you interested
Please add support for Android Beta
Why cant i leave you
"Needs improvement, but good job. Card images not working, cut scenes just showing pink, and can't read the loading or agreement screens."
Great game been waiting for this for awhile now.  And for those people who cant get the game running stop complaining and ask for them to fix it.  IF you get errors and sent to email to download that means your phone can t support it or you have a rooted device.  Japan is extremely against cheating so rooted devices won't work at all.
This game Is amazing
A-mei-zing
Why is there so much security against users with rooted phones??? This is too extreme and you are losing a good percentage of your users because of this. I'd love to play this game but I can't...
I think the game is trash because of errors and it will not let me play the game so if they find out how to fix it I'll rate differently thank you.
"Great, the summoning could use a little work though"
"I really love the story, characters, and gameplay; my one draw back is the fact that their are errors and glitchs still in the game. Example being screen going black during character special moves."
If you're a fan of Type Moon's Fate series. This game is a must for aspiring masters.
"Won't even start, says it's not playable in my environment"
Looking forward to the first event!
I really dislike that character will just continue attacking a dead creature for thousands of damage instead of just moving on to the next enemy.  What a waste.
Game crashed a lot on me still good but keeps crashing
"Games great, RNG sucks tho"
Awful localization. Continuous crashing. Would love to play and enjoy it. Hopefully it gets some major fixes soon.
I have played then Japanese version and it's amazing now being able to actually read what the story line is saying I love it. Brings a whole new light to the game itself. Great game play as well.
"Great game,there was an issue,but the develepors responded to my email in 5 min and told me the issue so i can play.I recomend this game to any fan of the fate series"
"At the time of this review (June 30), I have played 50+ hours since launch  If that doesn't tell you it's good, then the fact that besides minor hardware optimization issues, it's the best RPG I've played exclusive to mobile devices (not including emulators, obviously)."
Game is awesome but my game keeps crashing in the beginning of every battle and noble phantasm. Can this be fix or no?
great story and characters. horrible gacha rates doe
"The only real reason why this is getting 3 stars is due to the really low quality translation. There are grammatical errors, redundant and confusing sentences.  I was really hyped about this getting an NA release, but despite all the money Aniplex makes from overcharging for all their home releases, they couldn't be bothered to pay a bit more for a well-done localization."
"Play the Japanese version for a while, and I loved it. If it is anything like it's Japanese counterpart then I am sure that you will not be disappointed in this game just as I wasn't."
Won't work on Galaxy S7 edge SM-g935A
Thanks for translating the game and keep up the good work
Nice! Like the new English version
"I love this game but... It takes forever just trying to do anything, please fix the lag and the drop rate on 5* is ridiculous."
"I have awaited this game to come out in english for a very very lomg time now, and it was well worth the wait boasting graphics and gameplay far beyond what I had anticipated. It can use up a lot of ram with it's high grade content but if your phone can handle it it's very addictive and wonderful for anyone who's a fan of the Fate franchise or are looking for a fun action strategy style game to pick up. The story can be a bit slow as it usually tends to go for phone titles, but overall I am beyond in love with the way it turned out. If it weren't laggy at times for my phone, I would have given it a full 5/5, but it does tend to be a draw back when immersed in beating a boss or grinding a event level. In the future I would also love to see english voice acting as well, though I'm satisfied without it even so.   Tl:dr, great game, minor hang ups, play it if your phone can handle it. Looks great, plays great, girls are cute, and gameplay is very satisfying mechanically and interactively."
About time although I have to restart all over .
"I can't access the game. Every time I open it, it has me open gmail to email their support team. After receiving a response it turns out that the game won't run if your device is rooted, has dev options on, or has a custom rom. The problem is, I receive the same error even on a completely stock tablet.   These anti-cheater restrictions need to be looked at, because not only are they far harsher than any other game out there, they don't even appear to be functioning properly."
My phone broke shortly after summoning a 5 star and getting the transfer code and now on my new phone it won't let me transfer
"Won't even play on my Samsung galaxy 6, just keep getting an error email, instead of the game even opening."
"Great story, great character's... nuff said"
Love it great graphics and a good story
Passable. Engaging story with plenty characters you find yourself loving or hating. Gacha is abysmal though. That alone is almost enough to make me quit. I haven't seen a gacha so horrible since Rune Story. Most of everything else makes up for it though. I love and appreciate the work put into crafting a beautiful story and amazing art. I also wish your choices mattered or held some form of importance. Knowing that choosing either doesn't do anything hurts the game in my opinion. You give the illusion of choice being important when it holds 0 weight.
I would love to play the game but I continue to get the error code 60 when ever I try to play the game. I AM NOT ROOTED NOR DO I HAVE  DEVELOPER OPTIONS ENABLED! I am using a Samsung galaxy s8 on android 7.0. I will properly rate the game once I'm able to play it.
The summon rates are horrible but the story is pretty good. A major recommendation if you are a big fan of the Nasu universe and anime tropes. At the time of the review the translation has bad spelling errors but it's manageable.
Love Fate Grand Order so much hope this game get better and better
So happy to have this in NA!!
Loved the anime series now I love this. Can't wait for there to be more to the game.
"The localization is bad to say the least. The writing is random and often times doesnt seem to understand the character who is speaking or the fate universe. I'll keep playing because it's easier than playing the jp version, but if the translations aren't improved I dont see this version lasting."
"Horrendous 5 star drop rates , don't get too invested in the game or you'll be spending a lot of money, doesn't reward players for spending money either. I understand aniplex is new to release a NA version but the devs have to understand your competing with devs like SUPERCELL and Zeptolab over here. 1$ purchases go a very long way in their games and trying the Japanese model will not be as profitable in NA. Just a heads up, aniplex."
"Amazing gameplay, characters and story. Truly a game worth playing"
Looks interesting.  Too bad it just crashes when i try to load it
"Fix your damn game. I and alot of others can't even play because of your stupid root security measure. I do not have a rooted device and it tells me I do. But I don't. Either fix this or lose a lot of players and possible revenue. I expected better, or at least a quick fix."
"Great game so far, having a blast collecting new servants. Some of the  servant designs are too great though."
Need to fix the screen being cut off when typing friend id or anything that requires a numpad as you will only be able to cut and paste or use 123. Other than that you get your type moon fix.
"So nice to have a NA version, first gatcha i wont mind spending on"
Sucks ass cant even open the app get error code 60 but my phone isnt rooted
"Wow, I'm not gonna give it a higher score unless I can play it without data. I have an amazing Wi-Fi signal (143mbps) and it just won't play with Wi-Fi. Fix that, and I'll rate higher because the game itself is promising."
My only problem is the spelling and translation. I mean some of the name are spelled completely wrong. Even English name are spelled wrong and this is an official English localization. Hopefully an update comes out to fix it cause I've been cringing. By the way when I notice owned was spelled onwed on the restore stamina.
"There is quite a lot of meat to this bone. Plenty of content, mechanics to learn, characters to unlock. If you enjoy the Fate series, it's easy to recommend this title."
I love the story so far which is what makes this game so worth playing.
"Good game. However it keeps shutting down on me and the game keeps going up how much data it takes up whenever I play it. It went from a low 85 megabytes to 460 megabytes in just a hour or so of playing, why is it doing that? It was a big hassle to create my character name."
"It is okay, not great, I don't understand the hype. The graphics are alright, art is okay, gameplay is meh, and there is no pvp."
Finally finally finally here in english as a big fate fan I'm more then happy.
Saber is my waifu
Can't run it at all because dev mode is on. Ridiculous. Never seen another game which does that.
Very cool game for a fate fan and a cool story.
Been waiting  for this game for 2 years. Glad to finally be able to play it in my native language. Gameplay is fun and the game looks great. Definitely recommend if your a fan of the fate series.
"best rpg in smartphone. if u want play it for story, u get it because this game has interesting story other than most of rpg in smartphone. if u want gameplay, this gamr have a more complex team building than most rpg in smartphone. u must count ans think for the skill, cards, and soon. i think u will get the best experience if u play this game a while and not surrender if u get bad gacha. this game is still playable even if u only use *1-*3 cards"
This game is super addicting and a ton of fun
Had to default my phone as it disagreed with some apps.
"Very good, easy to use Please bring over updated animations for servant attacks ASAP!!"
Game is all about getting your favorite servants. Battle system is simple. Good game for fate fans.
Yea...error 43...No developer mode allowed on device when playing the game...guess I'm going back to fire emblem heroes.
Greatttttt
Complete waste of time. Gets boring very quick. I Was speed battling 45min into game play. And the horrid 10x draws nets you nothing time and time again. What a disappointment
It didn't let me play because of my environment .-.
Pulled a jeanne gg
Saber best waifu
"Bad localization, long load times foreverything (even after downloading full data), there is no RNGesus, and it gameplay and story is mediocre. Not even worth it as a fate fan"
The game is good but the translation can be pretty horrible at times.
Translation is a mess but so far it's entertaining...
"It's the best mobile game I have played, I love the Fate/ franchise and an English version is just what it needed before the release of the new anime coming out!"
This is the only mobile game that I see myself playing for years and years. Hopefully I can get lucky and get some of the servants I missed out on in the JP version. I'm looking at you Heroine X! I will roll you this time!
Best Gatcha sim ever
I'm in love
"I'm new to this series so far enjoying the story,even with all the mistakes people like to point and complain about it's still enjoyable,graphics are nice and crisp,Lots of voice acting it's really great, another thing when people are complaining about the load times just go to settings download the additional data it helps a lot"
It won't let me play!
"Still getting an error and automatic email generation every time I try to Launch. All updates installed, phone is not rooted or in developer mode or anything."
"It gives an error 60 code,  stating my device is rooted, when it is not. Sony Xperia users can't play this crappy game and this dev is foolish for not wanting to fix their game"
Need to save to Google cloud
Absolutely amazing a little harder than most mobile games but addictive gameplay can't wait for some events!!!
"Been playing since the jp version and I couldn't wait for the us release, people complaining about the rates need to understand every gatcha games rates for 5 stars are going to be low, if you don't wana spend money them Don't. I for one don't mind as I enjoy the game for both the story and the mechanics. Yes the translation is a little choppy here and there but they have addressed this and are preparing to adjust most of it. The game isn't for everyone but try it out for yourself, who knows maybe you'll see the enjoyment many players including I find out of this great series."
Pretty Damn good thats all I have to say
"Not a typical mobile phone RPG game, most playable servants come from other Fate series, and so much more later on."
What a wonderful game!
Simply amazing game not only enjoyable for calm yet fun turnbased gameplay but great detail to story and especially characters and to top it all off fate fans will love all the different servants and their histories that go along with them
This game has a great story line.One of the best I've seen in a while
"A freakin' sick localization of the JP game. The translation varies widely, going from amazing to pretty garbage, but aside from that, it's great. The one thing to note is that the game doesn't support rooted devices, and will crash on startup if you're not running a stock ROM."
"I like everything about the game except the gatcha part. It's easy to learn, fun to play, great character design. Then you have two things you can summon, characters and items to enhance them. Rates are complete garbage and I've summoned more crafting items than actual heroes, do they really think people outside of Japan will spend money on this? I think they took a note from the EA market book, screw over your fanbase for an extra buck. I don't mind spending money on these types of games but why would I risk getting something I cannot use because I have multiple copies of it."
Give 5 stars for five stars  Waver mou ikkai
Game crashes atm for me. Running Galaxy s8 on nougat 7.0
Holy Waifu Wars
Doesnt work on the note 4
Grammer sucks they just took fan made translation and implement it in plus the Japanese allowed to chose your servant not get a random one
"I love this game. Been playing the japanese version for so long and I have wanted to know exactly what my servants have been saying. That said, not all of it is great due to localization problems."
Unplayable on s6 edge
If you love story game or the fate series this is your game.
"Game doesnt even start up, it immediately closes after trying to boot up.. awful release.. 1 star"
"Rolled 5 star, giving 5 stars"
Ever since I heard this game was coming out i wanted  to play this game. Really love it so far
High quality graphic and good story
"Honestly the only problem I've had is with anything involving entering numbers. Whether it's entering a birthday or buying Quartz, the Number pad cuts off after 6 on the Android Galaxy s8."
I cant access the game. I get an error all the time. And send me straight to my email saying the game ia mlnot playable under my playing enviroment. I literally have a friend that plays this game. And he never got this message whats going on with this. I will change my rating. Once i can actually play the game . other than that i cant say anything else
"Crashes, crashes, crashes"
I have waited long enough. Time to play.
"Crashes on start, white screen then crashes"
Can't play the game because I'm on Android O
People saying the translation is bad are over exaggerating. There are some mistranslations and awkward sentences but nothing important. And by chapter two of the game all the grammar errors disappear
"This game is already amazing even though it just got released, there's already not much that needs to be fixed, great job on this."
Best story in a gacha game
"quality translations, ""plesase"" put in a bit of effort to not have awkward sentences that look like they've been mashed through a machine translator"
"Great game, however requires to not be rooted to play it"
Still fine
"The game is amazing and fun, and the customer support is juat as amazing helped fixed an issue I had quickly and I was able to enjoy the game thanks again"
I love it super interesting üëåüëåüëå‚úå‚úå
"This is one if the worst translations of a Japanese work I've ever had the displeasure of reading. Not only that, but they cut corners EVERYWHERE in absurdly lazy ways. Not to mention that they didn't adjust the gacha rates at all, making this one of (if not the single most) the worst drop rates for SR and SSR units in America. Hell, the world even. 1% SSR gacha rates is predatory and I've seen many of my friends spend HUNDREDS on the Japanese version without getting a single SSR. Do not give this company your money."
Love it but I played the Japanese version
"English translation is rushed, but good thing I'm japanese"
"First off, complaining because you can't get a 5 star when you can re-roll an infinite amount of times is ridiculous. Do the math 1% = 1/100 and no doing 10 pulls of 10 cards doesn't guarantee a 5 star. All gacha games operate on the same platform, it is to be expected. Similarly 40 pulls of 10 doesn't guarantee a thing. That aside I enjoy the combat and chains involved in the game. My favorite servants are Stheno and Elizabeth. I like the storyline and the ascension setup. Looking forward to seeing more servants and leveling up."
"Very fun, particularly for fans of the Fate series. Collecting servants feels great. The only problems I've encountered are occasional issues with the localization. Missing a word, using the wrong form of a verb, etc., but there've only been a dozen or so in the first 8 hours of the game. Ignoring that, the game is loads of fun. As a Fate series fan, seeing all the heroic spirits interacting with each other is wonderful. The questionable personality and gender adjustments of some heroes are perpetually amusing, and the story isn't as bad as the First Order movie made it out to be. Impressive combat system, acceptable story, detailed art. 5/5 for Fate fans."
best salty game ever
The game is amazing since the graphic is just beatiful and smooth.
This game had a lot of potential
"Game doesn't even work.  Clicking the icon opens up a Android dialogue box asking if I want to use Gmail, email or messaging?!  Fix your game."
So addicting!
"Loading... crash... try to multi summon and have to listen to every character you get talk, the enhancing is so drawn out in all these different options and for what? For cash and to eat ram apparently,  the actual gameplay was just like other boring generic games on the store, so yea this game was just hype. Peace."
Omfg thank God
"A great hero lottery style game featuring characters from an already great series. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the frequent crashes. It's early yet, so that may change."
Love the game so far
Basically collect the high star bs storyline is decent but needs a text speed option that is faster than what is there now.
Don't think of this as an rpg. It's a visual novel with subpar translation. I'm not into visual novels and the rpg aspect is too weak. It's basically impossible to lose. Good if you like story but bad if you're looking for a challenge.
Pretty fun like the turn based combat system.
Game doesn't start and auto crashes into an email. My phone isn't even rooted.
Sure I have waited for long and sure it is not the best quality but all games starting out is not perfect and I expected the transition from Japanese to English to be rough so I'm still very grateful
"Crashes on launch, HTC 10."
"In spite of over two years' of waiting, the English release of FGO has done nothing to make the game appeal to fans in the west with its missing content and abysmal gacha rates. That said, we fans were still happy to finally read the story, but currently upon release, the translation is filled with numerous simple grammatical errors from story cutscenes to the menus. Battle dialogue is also without subtitles so I may as well be playing on Japanese servers. Finally, the translation itself is dry and devoid of all the charm and personality of the story and characters while being completely ignorant of the source material. (I.e ""Altria Pendragon"") Aniplex, an industry leader in bringing Japanese content to the west, ought to be held to a much higher standard. When other game localizations have been delivering quality script translations and even with English voice acting on arguably tighter budgets, and when even fan translations are more consistent with series precedent, there's no excuse as an anime fan to accept a shoddy English release."
Perfect score for keeping original Japanese voiceovers. Please don't add English voice acting
Been the Japanese version for awhile now just happy to see it finally in English.
Doesn't work on the LG G4. Kind of disappointing because I was looking forward to play it.
"Love everything about it. What I like about it? ITS NEW, and original. Also the customer support. I couldn't get my game to work so it redirected me to a gmail/mail link. I sent the email. Got a respond in less than 30 mins. The solution worked. So for that I played it. Everything was great about it. It was different. I highly recommend it to people who like the anime and games. :)"
"Finally in English. This game is wonderful. More strategic than the other ccg battle games. The story is great, characters are the reason you play though. So many great ones and fully voice by stellar seiyuu"
"Never played the jp version or seen anything regarding the series. Oh man this game is fun. Graphics are great, not the bigheaded cartoon types I'm used to. Combat is awesome. Story is great so far. I love it"
"This game desperately needs Google's game saves. I want to play this at home and on the go on multiple devices as well, but your account seems limited to one device. Purchasing premium currency seems like too much of a risk until these functions are added. Otherwise, great game!"
Trying to run the game gives me an error message and redirects me to my email
Game won't start keeps going to share via
Doesnt work on S4 Galaxys
Cant play on my phones stock software due to overprotective root protection
Best Game I Had Played
A fun game that requires no real payment to succeed in. Try it out and have a blast.
I love fate so much!! Been waiting for this to come out!!
"I can't play the game due to some error, never even got to start it."
It's a great game with good story and interesting characters and i think all of you should play it too
"What the hell were you guys thinking? Who hired these translators? Can't you guys see the localization is messed up and all over the place? Did you guys half-assed the job? This is the OFFICIAL localozation, not some 14 y.o kid doing their summer homework. I really hope there will be a huge patch to fix the localization."
Neutral right now as I can't play it on my phone. Waiting for it to support the S8+
"Game doesn't work. Odd thing is, the Japanese version works perfectly on this phone..."
Shout out to raul A Garcia for telling us how to get the app working. VERY good.
I played the Visual Novle watched the anime and playing the jpn version so 6 out of 5 stars.
"Draconian anti-root protections; even having developer options on in an unrooted device prevents you from playing. I even wiped my phone to try to play but it still didn't work. I'm sick of developers who endlessly block power users from their apps because of the minority who abuse root. Maybe if gacha rates weren't so terrible there would be no need to hack? Anyway as disappointed as I am in the developers, there are plenty of other good games to play that allow rooted users so I wouldn't recommend obsessing over getting it to work."
Does not work on android o beta 3
I've been waiting for an English release for this game for a long time and now that we have it I'm glad to play it. They did a great job with it and I'm sure any nasuverse fan will be able to enjoy it fully.
It's all good but game can run slow at times
Immediately crashes upon opening
Pay 2 waifu
Game crashed on start
"Can't open on Samsung s7 edge. Error code 43 is shown. Hope it will be fixed, I've playing japan version for a while now and totally love it."
I've been playing the JPN version for about a year and was addicted! So glad that the english one is out now
lol
"Beautiful game, nice graphics. It's like a story with battles, it's great. Games these days have no story and are super boring, but this one is heavy on the story and I love it. Only issue it's the loading times, which are quite long. Since you was just released I'm guessing it will smooth out soon enough though. Good job"
Doesnt work on samsung s7
"I have loved the faye series since I started heavens feel vn ages ago, I played the jpn ver of this so glad it finally made it here"
"Just like the Japanese version, its fun. The servants are unique in their own way, very good sprites and background graphics, and a nice plot. The only problem that lies, is most definitely the translation. Several noticeable typos and a few grammatical errors here and there. I hope that this will be worked on soon."
FATE GRAND ORDERRRRREE!!!!
I love the fate series.
"Sends me an email about how it's ""not playable under this environment "" WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS"
It's the best game!!!
Localization needs more work.  So many errors and it doesn't live up to the hype in Japan
A gem of a game.
Won't open. Error 60 even though I unrooted
"Apparently my original review didn't stick. The game simply doesn't work. I have unrooted my phone, but it continually fails with error 60."
"The gameplay is good. But it also has the worst, most lazy localization I've every seen. The UI is extremely cluttered because of it when they try and fit multiple english words for the same purpose that one word could be used to accomplish."
Bellisimo
"Love F/GO, and want to support the ENG release, but the translation is downright awful. Will definitely rate higher if they get around to hiring some new translators who can do better than, ""0 Saint Quartzes Onwed"" and ""It was nice to have meet you!"""
"The only complaint I have is consistent between all gatchas.  Items are too expensive in the real money store.  Other than that, I'm surprised at the other qualities of the game.  It's pretty fun and has a decent story too."
Don't work
Root devices can't access this
"Non-rooted device, dev options turned off, still won't launch."
Brings back what we know and new things to learn
"Honest to God the worst rates in any gacha game, could spend 500 dollars and not see even one 1 star..... At least every other gacha has 3-6% and even give you 5 stars after a certain amount of gems used. Well here? You could have 300 acounts summoning and get all 3 stars. Y'all need to fix rates for real, your 1% feels like 0.01 lol... You ruin a perfectly awesome series with being money hungry."
Can't even open it without crashing
Played the jp version. Now time to go for more waifu power.
"I'm an OG FGO player who played the game since day one in the Japanese version. I'm very disappointed in the localization quality in the English version. There are misspellings, questionable comma usage, grammar mistakes, etc. The translation is obviously literal and makes Nasu's writing soulless. The fonts used in the UI is inconsistent and not good looking. This whole project just looks rushed."
Pretty much a waifu collector with some really nice visuals and voice acting. The story is great alongside the gameplay being fun for the most part.
Still rerolling saber plz
Great for fans of Type-Moon.
Re-roll you rating for five stars...
"Unfortunately the game doesn't like me having USB Debugging turned on. Considering I am a developer, that is a major downside. Guess I won't be playing much, because having to swap Debugging on and off to play and work is a real pain. Guess I'm passing on this. A pity, since I love the Fate series."
Doesn't open.
"Basically a full feature single player jrpg.  If you enjoy a strong narrative to your gameplay, go for it.  Microtransactions are pretty harsh if you're a completion is, but absolutely unnecessary for a full play through."
I haven't played it yet but i don't want it asking for a review and I'm sure its good
pretty fun for a mobile game
Don't bother trying to play if your phone isn't stock. Yet another company is attempting to punish users who desperately want to gain back their phone space by removing bloatware. Save your money.
I had a problem and sent the error email and got a quick reply and fix. The game does have quite a lengthy introduction but you can skip it.
For some stupid reason the developers make the game impossible to load with usb debugging on.....how are people supposed to livestream this game or make guides on youtube?
Great FATE series game. LOVE IT.
Very amazing fate game for everyone.
"I'm so glad that Grand Order finally released outside of Japan. It's an amazing game. As a Type-Moon fan, this game just makes me smile. It's incredible for a unit-based mobile game."
Crashes constantly!
I love how they finally put it into English.
"I've played the Japanese version, it was amazing and this is the same!"
"Refused to launch, Samsung Galaxy S7 running Nougat (Android 7). Opened an email with the error details instead of the game."
"Congrats on the launch! First off I think people complaining about the server being down should change their review, they have been up since 9 pm PST and working perfect since. Secondly this game has been working on my phone exactly as well as the JP app has, I'm enjoying the story aside from a couple translation mishaps/choices, but this game is definately very gacha heavy and will drain your battery."
"The graphics was shmeh, the gameplay boring, repetitive, and lackluster. You can't skip any of the battle sequences, I've seen them already. I don't care about how you can dramatically one shot a dinky skeleton. The fact that you can only bring 2 of your own servants to battle is stupid. Oh, and when I closed the app and relaunched, the news letter popped up, blocking my screen, and the exit button is under my home button menu thing. There's so much more to nitpick about this. I was hoping for a replacement for Rage of Bahamut, and I was let.down."
"IF GAME CRASHES , TURN OFF USB DEBUGGING, GOOGLE IT IF YOU DONT KNOW"
translations a bit rough and theres some kinda silly typos but the gameplay is enjoyable and is super easy to play as a F2P
I absolutely love type moon and their characters.
My friends are all playing it instead of talking about bodybuilding
AHAHA NOW ILL BE ABLE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEYRE SAYING WITHOUT  NEEDING JISHO EVERY SECOND GOD BLESS
The best. And the world
M A C H I N E  T R A N S L A T I O N
Please make sure your game is capable of installing before putting it on the play store.
"super fun, and simple too!!"
"Amazing game, one of the best if not the best game in the market. Intricate storytelling, amazing characters, awesome music. Download immediately!"
Unable to boot on my Google Pixel XL.
Doesn't even work on my galaxy s6.
Gameplay is slow as hell
I really wanted to play but i get error and an emal i need to send error idk how i can play the game with this peoblem.
"Amazing game with incredible art and story, been playing the Jap version since release and I'm excited now that the English version is out!"
Game crashes
Can't even start the damn game!
What's the point in releasing a game where I have to send an email to support informing that the app has an error?
"Error code 60, uprooted device, debug mode is off, developer mode is off. Good app xd"
This game is one of the best ones I've played so far
Time to shed tears n be salt over our gachas!
Time for reroll hell guys
Damn thing don't work.
*maniacal laughter*
"Finally, it's on US!"
I love fate a lot but it I can't load the app can anyone give me tips on what to do? It just keeps saying its preparing for launch I've already tried to uninstall and reinstall it.
this is a great & excellent game for true gamers. its the ultimate anime gamer game. save your quartz for arjuna
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENGLISH A LONG LONG TIME AGO GODDAMMIT
"Game isnt even out for another hour, chill with the anger people."
Love the story and charcters as well as how f2p friendly it is.
I have been playing the japanese version for at least 2 years. While ot can be tedious the game is fun and the story is very compelling and canonical like the anime and  light novels. Enjoy the game but please save your saint quartz for something good lol.
How to make more normies101
"Doesn't boot. Start the game and it instantly crashes, which apparently is do to my phone being rooted.  Don't want your game to play on rooted phones = I'll just play something else instead."
"The REGEND comes alive, in English!"
Tried the Japanese version loved it but couldn't understand plot and the fate series is one of the best I've played but now I can thank you so much
can't play error code bs
Played and loved the JP version
"I played the JPN since day one and it's the only mobile game I still play longer than 2 weeks. It's very F2P friendly and you only roll for your favorites. Each characters have unique animation, characterization and constantly update with many lowest rarity are all viable endgame. The plot is amazing (after Rome chapter) beyond mobile standard or same lvl as regular game. No stressful PvP and power tiering. Devs actually play their game to help improve.....pls don't mess up English translation tho *coughAltriacough*"
"Great way to get into the Fate franchise if you dont have time to pore over a load of texts. Easy to pick up for beginners. Plus most units are good, you just have to make a team to make up for their weaknesses."
Can't wait for it to be playable
Yaaas!
Can't access the game.. I don't know why it's not working yet...
Lit game
played since the Japanese release and still going strong.
"It's finally good to understand the game, and for people complaining it isn't working, is because the game is not launch yet, but can be downloaded."
People complainimg about not the app not working... You can't start playing until 9pm sanfransicso time.
I can't even play? It says it is still in preparation for launch?
Hasn't even come out yet lol &lt;o/
Glad to see this finnaly came over!
Ok so i remove the root completely/ turn off debugging just to try this game but no it still give me f*king error. Game/franchise itself is good but worst handling cant even launch the f*king app
Okay so rooted/developer phones are not allowed... :/   Having launch issues on Sony Xperia Z5 using Android 7.0.  The game launches as a file to message and that's it. In task manager the game is not running.
"It won't let me play the game after I've been waiting so long for it. Please fix this.  It's not fair that you'd have to unroot your phone and remove dev options just to play this, even though it's still not working anyway.  It's the 25th around the world, just let us play."
"Repetitive gameplay, lots of boring grinding, and TERRIBLE gatcha rates (Time to get spooked by Kirei). The only redeeming factor is the story, which for all I know might also be garbage because I can't read moon runes. Time to find out?"
The game won't load. Says it's not available to play and still being peeped for launch. Please fix this cause it seems like it's working for some and not other. Very disappointing.
9pm pst in an idiotic release time for a us game. Wouldn't have even known that the email pop-up wasn't due to some other reason had I not scrolled way waaaaay down in the comments. Will update review as necessary
Today is launch day and i can't even play it
I have been playing on jpn for a year. The game is great and the company cares about its players.
Awesome love it
Game doesn't boot at all. On Android 6.0
Seibah ?
Cant play the game. When i try to open a message comes up asking if i want to open with email.  :/
Lol at the people complaining that they can't play it before it's officially released.
"Really fun game, can lose track of time easily when playing"
I played this game in Japan and it really does the franchise justice. The story is great and so is the game play.
"My device is not rooted, and it shows the error code 60‚Ä¶i can even play PAD JP version on this device how come I cannot play this game"
Glad they finally released this game
"Who releases a game at 9pm pst... Even if its too smooth out the servers, they should already be prepared considering Japan and China lessons"
Internal screaming
"This game has the worst gatcha system, don't expect to get good servants. Art is good though, and tamamo fox is bae"
Been playing the Japanese version since launch and can't wait to start the game in English!
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"For some reason it boots Google app, which crashes. Then nothing happens. On Nexus 6p with Android 8.0 - no root"
Super hype for the lanch i finally will be able to read the text in FGO
Above all else it a very good game for the series itself since most of the other game follow the stories from the Manga or from the show this one give the player chance to be in this new story with a Servant of your choice from history itself as well as discovering and learning brand new thing from the series. For new player or people who getting into the series itself I believe that this would be a great game for them.
"I'm here to kick Beast ass all over again. Game should be good if you played jap release, can't say how american gacha will work. However Sumunai is best for chapter 1"
"Looking forward to the release, to finally be able to play the English.   For those of you have trouble with error codes, someone posted an explanation back with the Japanese Version.  Error code 1 = apk clone from Dalvik byte code  Error code 23 = Jailbreak  Error code 60 = Rooted  Error code 10 = emu / unknown reason  Error code 43 = Usb debug on / dev option on  Error code 90 = apk clone from Apkeditor  Error code 91 = apk it's Broken  Error code 92 = Modified apk / xposed"
I am trying to play it it keep saying they preparing for it's release which is today.
Why is everyone saying the game is good and all when it's not even able to play? Lol
Excellent!
"Welcome to your worst nightmare, I hope y'all enjoy your stay here."
"I am unable to open it, when i try it always gives me fate/grand order is still not playable as it's currently in preparation for it's launch."
I don't care about the problems right now cuz I'm hyped and they can be solved later
Launch day can't play 1 star cause 0 doesn't exist
It says I can't play till release date??
Been playing since the JP version. A shame we can't use our JP version but I get to read the story now! That's just as good!
Been playing the jpn version for a while and I love it never though it would have an English version
"Great game, easily playable without spending money. Also has pretty interesting mechanics too. Fun game."
Scathach best waifu
I've been waiting for this. Awesome game
unplayable
Been looking forward to this for a while now. This will be one of my two main mobile games!
Played the JP version for a month or two. I'm not even mad at the game. Just salty that some guy decided that a midnight release (EST) on the 26th was a good idea.
"Best mobile game honestly and they are being so generous with the English release. @low rating people: you aren't being blocked because root device, you're being blocked cus it hasn't been released yet <_< 9 pm pst is when it goes live. (for clarification for others, my rating is based on playing the game for 1 1/2 years in japanese)"
I have been waiting for so long for this game.
"""is not playable under your playing environment"" really?! Not rooted, have not tinkered with the phone. Must be the make and model then?!"
Love this fate based app game
"Finally the English version. I've been playing the JP version for some time, and now finally I can understand the story. Happy Gacha everyone. Try not to get spooked."
"App starts to open, gets to a white screen then crashes. Every time."
Its lit
Love the fate series and lost countless hour to the up app now I can acctually read what's going on.
Finally I been waiting for this moment
"Oy, This is hell you're walking into."
Still waiting for the opening release tomorrow. Will change the ratings by then.
Finally xD
Not compatible with Android O Developer Preview 3.
I hope I get somebody good!
Have been playing the Japanese version for the past two years and it is now a great feeling to be playing with my friends.
Finally is coming to the usa
Brilliant but prepare to either suffer long waits or to sell your kidney to get characters you want.
"Phone not rooted, developer options and usb debug off. The game opens, shows a white screen and then wants me to send an email because reasons, I guess? I wish I knew actually. You have released a non functional app, please address."
"Great game, but I couldn't help but notice the third image of this app's page used Jeanne instead of Sasaki Kojiro in order to hide the fact that he is the only bronze servant from fsn."
False release date for half of America.
How is 9pm PDT a June 25th release date for North America? Only half of America can play it on the 26th. Why not just say the release date is the 26th and not get everyones hopes up.
I'm a shameless fanboy of the franchisees. I would love literally anything that Type Moon would release.
Enjoyed playing the Japanese server of the game and will definitely enjoy the NA server now that I can immerse myself in the story without reading translation from other people (still appreciate their efforts very much) looking forward to a lot of salt and low budget food for the next years. Zashuu!
damn good
Waited so long for this!
"Well now, you think you are done? No! Yeah, I got the game. I waited til June 25th to play it. And you know what? The whole problem with the email happened again. I redownload the app for good measure, but still no go. Please, fix this. I really can't wait."
GIVE JEANNE OF SHISHOU
Its great!
Finally the anime that made love Japanese culture is made into a mobile game
My body is ready -^-
I love all fate works especially fate/zero i so can't wait to play this game and i can't wait for fate/apocrypha in early july thank you type moon team eighting cavia
Been playing the JP version for almost two years. Anything that keeps me having fun for that long deserves a good review.
Twist me good and bless me RNG GODS
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"THANK YOU TYPE MOON FOR MAKING THIS GAME IN ENGLISH!!! OMG, YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!!!"
Mikoonn Cannt wait lewd tama
Me like gamr
Please let me play and thank you! Need fix this fate grand order
The most story driven and pretty f2p friendly game featuring characters from typemoon universe is finally released in NA. I'm really happy to play it.
"If people had read the news, the game isn't out until the 25th of June,  hence why they cannot play it yet. I read somewhere the launch will start at anime expo or something?? I've been looking forward to the English release and can't wait to try it out."
The true Waifu Wars mobile game is finally released in N.America!
I wait so long for this
Fou is Primate Murder Dr Roman is Solomon Mashu is Galahad Lancelot is unrivaled
Finally english translation version is outü§ó. Hey guys the game was supposed to launch tomorrow. So the servers will be out for 1 more day i guess and stop giving negative reviews for bad translation.  Rooted phones are not supported.
Been playing Japan version and waiting so much for this english version. I totally recommend this game  more if love fate series really entertaining and fun
Brynhildr is the best Lancer in the game. Make sure you roll for her when she comes out
"Love the jp version, so I'll support the eng version for the story"
It should be ARTORIA PENDRAGON. It should be Sword of Promised Victory - Excalibur. It should be [all caps] EMIYA. ENDULGED IS NOT A WORD. And you couldn't even bother translating the chants for Noble Phantasms.  I expect the same laziness in regards to My Room lines.
I can't even open the app. It directs me to send an email and tells me that FGO is not playable under my playing environment. I have the latest Android version and should be fine.
"This is the best introduction to the Fate series for someone who isn't afraid of skipping the smoke and mystery usually surrounding the characters, and not sure if they should invest their time. You get to meet a colorful cast of characters, and growing attached to one is rewarding for both gameplay and personal fulfillment. No one in this game is useless, everyone can fill some role, and even the common rarity units have some redeeming quality. The attention to player satisfaction in this free to play game is matched by NO ONE. Overall a well-designed experience, worth my 365 days of playtime on the original server, and some other people have three times that."
It's Artoria Pendragon! Get the translation right if your going to do it in the first place.
Yyyeeeaaahhh!!!!
Welp.
Amazing game!! Screw all the haters!
"If it's anything like the JPN version, you're in for a treat. Just bear with the servers for the first week 'cause alot of people will be rerolling."
Games awesome
"Played the JP version for about a year, and loved it. Translations aside, I'm just happy to have it localized!"
ARTORIAAAAAAA
Played the JP version since release and it been a blast.
"please aniplex, fix the translation and meet the fandom or atleast see their works, see their translation, if possible, hire them. or atleast fix it. this translation is worse than we know from fate material (servant's name like EMIYA as Emiya -_-, i'm fine with altria)  and the one thing u guys must not FORGET. their (servants) behavior, the way they are talking or their words, U MUST TRANSLATE IT CAREFULLY. or, more 2 * for u."
Pokemon is the best
Welcome to salt factory
"It's time to get salted in the summons. Also ignore the retarded idiots who hate the series and fanbase. They are the ones responsible for all the trouble. As they say. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it"
"Don't be fooled by the gacha or servant lottery system as it really is a low rate for getting the 5 star servants aside from the annual paid gacha that guarantees it. Story is great, gameplay is simple. This is based from the jpn experience and there will not be much difference from the English aside from the locked servants because of story. Initially the will not be a wide variety but the throne of heroes off type moon has access to essentially it's multiverse.  Best of luck to all new players and again don't get trapped by the gacha."
Been waiting for this
"Her name is Artoria you morons, listen to people who speak the language you are translating into instead of the idiots that can't."
Attila best girl
ALTRIA DID NOTHING WRONG
Can we skip NPs yet?
Great just the rng can be stressful at times
"Gimme that finely ground pullsalt, baby"
