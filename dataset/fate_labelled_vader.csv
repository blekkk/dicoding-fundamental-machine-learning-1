The game was good but sadly runs very poorly on older devices making it almost unplayable.,negative
"Account linking when? If there is a reason NA can't have it early, if we can ever have it, we need to know. Lasengle needs to put out a statement. They won't though since their community interaction/PR consists of scheduled social media posts, YouTube premieres which consistently show how ridiculously small their promotional budget is, and the occasional rushed livestream the two or three times a year they happen to have a panel at a Convention. I won't hold my breath.",negative
I played for a day then it stopped working. it just shows a black screen after start up.,positive
Played this a while back and already built a lot of heroes and also got very lucky with pulls. Wanted to play again but the problem is the account linking! It's been years and they still don't have any means of logging in other than using a one-time code (which I sadly lost)... months of grinding wasted...,negative
"First things first, I've been playing this game for a good 7? 6? years now and this has arguably the worst Qol and Gacha in all of Gaming. Through those years, Azur Lane has changed its UI, implement tons and tons of Qol and revamped so many gameplay things. FGO? Its still the same since I was in Senior High. Literally the only stuff that changed are for the Whales with USOs. All in all, this is an EXTREMELY HORRIBLE gacha game with the worst Pitt system in all of the other competitors.",negative
"Gudako!! üôÄüôÄ (Edited: Okay but for real the rewards are so bad, like it's so difficult to get SQ it's like Genshin but probably worse)",negative
"I can't log into my account because the transfer number can only be used once, basically I just lost my 4 years old account. You guys really do everything to make our lives difficult kek",negative
I love the game but because of my phone it keeps crashing and I just wish I can play it on PC.,positive
question do you think you could think about adding in a feature so that if someone completes the event story they can pick any one 4 star servant beside the temporary one from the event and they can choose whether to get a copy of the 4 star if they already have for an np boost or pick the one they don't have.,positive
didnt get the gold berserk only 2 chloe still didnt get >:(,positive
good game but I recently reinstalled and it seems that I lost access to my old account for the game,negative
"Got to love game makers in 2025, cause you have failed to do the data transfer through Gmail or any other means. so I couldn't remember the password I Set Up. unfortunately I will not start this game a third time. Fgo you are now a dead game to me, it was fun to play but time to move on!",negative
"The story is pretty decent, if a bit campy at times, especially the events, but it has its charms. Has a very anime feel, if you like that. The gatcha part is not the best part for sure, but they do a good job making almost any unit be useable, so use who you like & enjoy. returned this year to see the LB stories in full, loving that, hope it gets animated. biggest gripe is still the grinding time, truly wish there was an auto complete for nodes you beat with no deaths or use 2-3x for multiclear",positive
the advanced quests are quite mentally ill,negative
don't use it,neutral
"I got Chloe so, 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",neutral
Made the wolf game in advanced quest impossible to beat. You lose characters every turn no matter what you do. 1 star for the quest you made.,negative
"spent $300, never got the SSR I wanted. it's Gacha, I get it but I don't need this in my life anymore. thanks for the memories Fate GO.",positive
Woah Astolfo has a whole game???!?,neutral
"The game is fine. Hopefully, they will shorten the stories they make in the future.",positive
I loves it every burst skill animations but I hope they would make a 2nd version of fate game apps...more better and improvements gameplay and also a good graphic... I also loves the story..,positive
lost my account because the company that has had this game running for 10 years still to this day has no way to link your account to an email. Still goes off the the code and password so I hope you never lose the code like i did. Ten years and many many many mobile games have made account interest linking a base but this one can't? I would LOVE to see their bs excuse as to why they cant.,negative
Great story. The only problems of this game are the; First: Gacha Rate Up/Pity Second: Materials Drop Rate/Events Drop Rate,negative
"5 star if you want an early death, 1 star if you want to live a long and happy life",positive
i feel sleepy after trying this game,neutral
I like this game alot but when u do 100 summons from an event and not get a single ml5 except from the 2 tickets that is almost quite worthy.,positive
"I just lost my 5th account today and I'm very upset, please make a sync account system, I really don't want to keep losing my account.",negative
"story is very good, highly recommend you to read it if you know the fate franchise. Also, i would like to point out that google play sometimes provides discount vouchers for ingame purchases but the minimum amount spent required is higher than any purchase FGO has. So I'd like to suggest google to provide smaller coupons or for FGO itself to provide bigger packs to solve that problem.",positive
ts worse than a 9‚Äì5. you work and lose more often than you gain. at least its story is good sometimes,positive
"You never learned guys, im a fan but i despised you're practice...",negative
"Thank you to customer support / service for helping me out & explaining in better detail what I thought I had comprehended but was ultimately wrong about even after all these years as embarrassing as it is to admit. I guess all these years I must have had great luck & when the guaranteed summon was implemented I must have hit it a few times leading me to gain a false understanding. Thank you again, I truly appreciate it. I still am docking one star for no account linking / binding yet for NA üôè",positive
"As a Fate fan , this is truly amazing game",positive
terrible account recovery,negative
"Very fun game, interesting story and cool servant designs. My only issue as of lately is that the game keeps lagging and often freezes up and skips animations during battles especially. This used to happen only a few times in the past and I didn't mind it at first but now it's so bad I can't even get through a proper battle without having to log out of the game. Sometimes it even just kicks me out of the app itself, please help.",negative
Worst gacha game by far. Horrible for newer players. They dont have enough resources. Boss battles take specific units to clear. Gameplay is boring. Gacha system is the greediest thing I have ever seen. Took them years to add a spark. Spark will take you a year to save up for one character that does not carry over. Play at your own risk. Game is a cash grab.,negative
"I'm getting way too many 5 and 4 star CE and not a single Servant from Ruler Melusine banner.. huh, very suspicious..",negative
It still floors me how this game can make billions of dollars but they can't afford to have acct linking. I got an error message last night telling me to clear the cache in the hopes of it working again and that it wouldn't erase my game data and it turns out there was maintenance a few minutes later. Fast forward to this morning where I boot up the app to roll for Barghest and the game starts me at the tutorial. I sent in a support email but I'm still waiting to hopefully recover my account.,positive
Terrible rates horrible for a f2p.,negative
"I am only intereated in the story and graphics but the gacha and the resource are very hard to get, especially the gacha that you get to spend 1000 sq to get a servant you want and that is hard coz it is hard to earn sq in this game unlike the Genshin Impact that has the same gacha and hard to get resources, but they have a pity system that has guarantee 5 star roll and the FGO have no pity system. Playing for the story. Edit: The gacha is also rigged",negative
"Soooo disappointed after all these years, I still see no effort jn from the developers in the implementation of an account linking feature to protect peoples efforts in s√πpporting this otherwise great game. America is STILL WAITING. #1 top grossing $$$#'DFTR",positive
"Been playing this game for a year and it sadly does not allow USB Debugging on, but that can be solved by turning it off. Meanwhile, when the usb debugging and developers option are turned off, a software update from my phone was pushed and I updated, FGO doesn't seem to work because the automatic software update turned usb debugging on, turning it off no longer works. Please fix this.",positive
"backed up my transfer number and pass in 2020 played till 2022. now I tried to play again (3 years later) and it somehow says my transfer number is still in use, even tho my old device, which I used to play, has been dead for 3 years without logins as the phone's broken. oof I'm just glad I didn't spent much.",positive
"Great game, awesome graphics. But my only gripe is that you can't go back to the beginning. Stages and grind to level up not even on the characters that you haven't leveled up, forcing you to have to buy, whatever it is that they're selling so that you can upgrade your character. I think that kind of sucks. Compared to other games that give you the option to go back to the lower levels and grind your way through and upgrade your characters. If they can fix , that will be great",positive
"This game REVELS in wasting your time. If you're new don't even bother starting, you'll be reading story for months before you're remotely caught up and allowed to participate in events. This game extends what should be done in a minute to 10 minutes of watching the same animation and derivative dialogue over and over. Get with the time lasengle, either make a game that is worth the time spent on it or reduce the amount of time it takes to play.",positive
"I played through all of the story content and I can say this is one of the best games I have played on Mobile in terms of story,the Gacha is mediocre but over hated (I have gotten about 18SSRs in a year fully F2P). There's not much to do other than grinding after you are done with the story. however,no one is finishing a 100+ hour story quickly.So in my opinion this game deserves a shot.",negative
i love this game,positive
"as a person who plays gacha games, this one was the most boring one I've played. so therefore I'm redownloading it to try it for the 3rd, but this time, I'll pay attention to the story that has zero voice acting edit: just to add, I don't like being forced to use supports and I hate how long it takes to get through the summoning animation",negative

"Worst rates in the market. Somehow have always had much, much better luck with my JP account, so something about this version feels incredibly rigged.",positive
"Same outdated and stagnant gameplay, QoLs barely changes whatever is in, 4star servant are hard to max out unless you're a whale.",negative
"where is my summer Skadi :""(",neutral
"Having just beaten Lostbelt (FGO2 to casuals) yes this game is actually 3 games in one. Fate/Grand Order is an incredible story where you can see and feel the protagonists grow and develop from a typical meek mage to the total badass you should be after conquering some of the crazier stakes in this game. The Gameplay may be simple but it is fun, the story(s) are what keep me coming back!",positive
"2500 SQ and got two 5 star Servants across two banners. I have played for 6 years and had a great time, but I don't think I can keep going.",positive
"I don't really need to explain why I like it the fate universe is popular 
for a reason cause it has interesting back story's and twists upon history 
that make you wanna look up the real story online at least I do",positive
"waifus. the drop rates make getting items feel so good. the gacha rates make getting SSRs a wonderful event. I didnt get abbigail so rip 2025 update : rateup is a lie, now that my friendgroup and I are all adults they all whale but I DONT so I get no ssrs, still 5 star rating for story though",neutral
"game is trash, the gacha is trash, good luck",positive
"Fate/Grand Order is a game that I overall enjoy, generally having a good story and writing (though it can absolutely depend on the chapter), great character designs, and excellent presentation. However, the game is also quite stingy with its gacha elements and the drop rates on items, and the game's difficulty definitely ramps up after a while, making it feel like you have to roll for new servants or spend a ton of time grinding for materials. but atalante cute so",positive
"The game is fun, and the story is great with a wide variety of characters. Combat is turn-based and very simple. Events are too dedicated however and feel too gridny compared to older events of 2 years ago. Also lack of pity system is a negative.",positive
"No se que es m√°s absurdo, que las probabilidades de que te toque un personaje de 5 estrellas sean casi nulas, o que lleve casi los mil d√≠as en este juego, en fin, bombardeen Per√∫ üëçüèª",negative

"great game overall, great story and character design.",positive
it's fine I guess,positive
it takes way too long to download I mean why,neutral
The account system is ancient and can result in an easy account loss. The level system is slow when it only goes by a certain number of experience materials at a time. there is no quality of life features for the mindless repetitive grinding,negative

"this game is extremely outdated and refuses to fix anything. their ""pity"" is a joke, 330 roles for 1 of 2+ select 3+‚≠ê characters is laughable. the fact their UI is so OLD and hasn't changed in years. their recent anniversary event is a joke of spend 40$ for maybe a character you will like. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON ACCOUNT RECOVERY. how is an 8yr+ old game not using ANY form of account recovery? fans need to stop supporting their bad and toxic practices. this game is bad and doesn't care.",negative
Very fun simple yet deep pixel art is awesome. Behind the times gacha pools now that other gacha games separate the equipment and the characters. Finally has a pity system. Advanced Quest system is so poorly designed they have to bribe players to clear it.,positive
I think it's changed over the years and they have made it more user friendly with giving out heroes. The odds are still frustrating for how many resources are given out but they always add more content and the characters are all really well made.,positive
Since the game likes to give me 3 stars I feel it's only fair,positive
After playing the game since release I want to give a new review. I am still giving it a one star why you ask? well 1. I tried to recover my data after my phone was stolen and the recovery team never helped me get it which was stupid. 2. My friend gave me his extra account which now I devoted my self to put some money like I did with my old data. My conclusion game is good but recovery team is terrible and I hope to never loose this data.,positive
You took my account from me and I will do everything in my power to take what you love too. Look out for me because I will find every one of you and I will not stop until you all come face to face with the Artoria you took from me.,positive
1200 rolls and just 2 rate up ssr. hah.,neutral
"just don't play this stupid game at all, developers are scamming you out of your money and they only want one thing from you which is money. this game is horribly pay to win. you need to sacrifice 10 cows to get a single 5 star unit, and even that is not enough. you have a higher chance of getting hit by a lightning bolt than get a 5 star from this game. and don't bother contacting support they only listen to you if you have money",negative
been playing for years now,positive
this was the greatess game i ever play,positive
"Game has always had the potential to be great. Yet it never will be due to greed and players who fall victim to it. Outdated UI and terrible UX for this day and age and no sign of them ever planning to update it. Pity system is beyond ridiculous. Considering you even have the potential to lose your account randomly without recovery. so, a warning, if you play this game, then it should be purely to pass the time‚Äîspend your own cash wisely, you could easily lose it all.",negative
"Seriously Devs, it's been TEN YEARS now and we still don't have a way to permanently bind our account that isn't through this horrible code system, PLEASE Aniplex or anyone in the higher up chain, ADD THE BINDING ACCOUNT FEATURES TO ALL SERVERS! Stop catering only to ASIA SERVERS!",negative
"The currency used for pulling has two versions: free and paid. Most banners require the paid version. This is more comparable to Raid Shadow Legends than to a typical modern gacha game, and it's kind of disgusting. Less important but somewhat notable, the art style is all over the place, with many character designs resembling a 13-year-old's deviantArt OC. I give FGO two stars because it's still leagues better than the average mobile game.",positive
"the game is good for me, but is quite a hassle to find material when i don't know where it can be farmed. maybe a way to tell you where you can find the material or in the story or in the daily quest",positive
(Edit) Epic Storytelling that kept me here for years. still engaging enough even after so long,positive
I love Douji,positive
"I'm done with this game. You are the worst gacha devs of all time. You give us 100 SQ, I summon, I get the same copies of two 4 star characters I already have and a 5 star CE. I don't care about the story anymore. I hope Hoyoverse buys this franchise, at least they'd give better treatment to this game and its players. There haven't been any improvements to the 5 star drop rates, it's impossible to reach pity as F2P, and the menus are still ugly and boring. Not recommended.",negative

"This is probably the only game that does not allow me to enter the game despite having a stable connection. Whenever I try to enter the game, I'm always stuck at the connecting screen for a long time before being told that the game failed to connect to the server and that I should retry or restart the app which I already did... 11 times. My other online games work, IDK what's this game's problem.",negative
"Day 1 Player. Still salty about not pulling Skadi after 800 SQ and 55 Tickets last time. Pity System was introduced so late into the game. Not to mention, unlike other gachas, this game will lock you out of certain Limited Time Events if you aren't caught up in Part 2 and with its High Difficulty, which is bad for new players and vets who dont have the time to play. Overall, Story, Characters, Artwork is good, but not leenient if you arent playing Day 1. DO NOT LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT ALSO",positive
"Jul/2025: i thought this game changed after years of not playing it. still the worst gacha system in the world. 90% of meta characters locked behind fomo, roster is garbage for f2p, pity system does not exist. deleting this app again going to go play NIKKE.",negative
I have been trying for 5 star characters and never get any. I had used all the bonuses to try and get the new 5 star character and got no 5 star characters. I swear this is bad.,negative
Would give it more stars if they lowered the pity,negative
THIS IS GOOD YEAAAHHH ITS GOOD,positive
i hate this game,negative
"The game is still fun after all these years, but can we PLEASE get a FREE auto battle? I can't bring myself to login and use all my stamina in repetitive farming day in and day out. if I can clear in 3 or even 5 waves without casualties and without the aid of friend supports, I should be able to just auto battle using my stamina. would care a lot more for this game if at least that quality of life change was made.",positive
I hate this game becoz I don't get saber alter on her banner which makes me disappointed,negative
EXCALIBUR!!!,neutral
"If you're fortunate enough to read this review before you get the game, don't get it. The quality is poor, drop rates are horrendous, and extremely predatory with its microtransactions (they literally separate free premium currency from paid premium currency). No event gives you any cool new free stuff. making any decent progress a slow, painful grind. The gameplay is so repetitive that you will lose interest in about a week of having the game.",negative
"8 years of (dis)service in NA, 10 in JP and still no account binding or PC client. Constant typos. Servant C*ins. No more costumes or animation updates. Buffs slowed to a crawl. No new low rarity Servants, popular NPCs never released because they're not overdesigned waifu slop. Same old gameplay but with powercreep so bad that bosses all have invul, pierce invul, buff block x3, debuff immun, dmg cut + so much more you have to scroll, all unremovable. Forced daily engagement system (Storm Pods).",negative
"honestly,I installed this game cause of Astolfo :3",positive
"Its got a good story arc that gets better as you go. Events can be fun. Also, gatcha is hell. Pull up a seat pilgrim and pass the salt. *After trying out other games, the lack of a desktop pc app and auto battle really hurts the quality of life experience, as it takes a lot of your time to do just about anything. I have been spoiled by being able to go between my phone and pc applications and how great that is for my time in life when trying other products, and that really shows FGO's age.",positive

"6/2025 No Account safety-Lose Phone Lose Everything. Either way when an update is needed you can't even generate a SAFE TRANSFER CODE (to allow transfer to another device) this would be helpful. Just another Gacha/Loot Box/Gambling game that ""Auto-Updates"" Google Playstore THEN you still WAIT for the game to download its DATA. No Account system except in Japan, Extreme FOMO mainpulation tactics, No Auto-Battle, No replay Story fights, and no VA in storymode.",negative
"Overall great game. Biggest complaint is the crashing and horrible pity system, the story is really dull at the start. When you get to Camelot, that's when the story gets really good. (And hard) Wish my phone had enough space to continue playing this game, as this ain't no small game.",positive
Peak gaming experience.,neutral
"Bad experience. if you watch the story on auto, when your phone decides to sleep and you turn it back on in less than a second, this boots up the logo and goes on blank screen infinitely. this boots up in blank for a couple of times even if you keeps killing it in task until you Force stop this then it ask you to redownload your cache which you say no then runs fine again. Big waste of time!!! üëæ",negative
"This gacha is my favorite. It doesn't have as much QOL as a modern day gacha game, but they have been implementing it from time to time. I recommend only spending on GSSR and Destiny Order GSSR if you're a low spender tho.",positive
Honestly I have been playing this game since release. The issue now is the game has way too many irrelevant CE cards and it's been twice now that the promised servant card after 330 summons (spent a tonne on Beast Nero and currently Medusa Saber). I am currently at a point I'll have to stop playing due to the fact I have no new servant summons and all my servants are max level and no more of them are worth upgrading with all 4 star and below servants basically being NP lvl 5 and CE are pointless,positive
The worst rates ever went through 1k quartz got 2 5 stars. Trash game.,negative
The BEST. Should add another jeanne spiritron dress (dress from fate carnival). Until then you will get your 5 star haha sorry just jalter fan here,positive

the sync account is stupid,negative
"editing my review 6/13/25 been playing since launch on jp so i remember what a nightmare the original game was when it first started. that being said there have been many good QoL changes to the game since then and once you get to Camelot the story finally gets good. the first 5 singularities were mediocre at best and even some of 2.0 was disappointing. there's not enough space to explain why. anyway if you're getting into this for the story, please don't have high expectations",positive
"Okay, had trouble with my old phone, the support team was great, which I should have contact them around February, when the game crashed instead of waiting until today, aka 4 months.

"Outdated gacha game with bad rate, bad QoL, repetitive gameplay. At least the story is good at times",negative
"First off: while I give this game a full score, I have to mention that this game is sort of the opposite of your big, mainstream gacha game. The beginning is the most painful part as you are completely without options besides other people's Servants, whatever the beginner gacha offers and a few other things. This game gets a lot more interesting once you gather many Servants (even low rarity ones) and can make teams. It offers a good degree of freedom and looks great in its 2D anime-style.",positive

"Lack of Limited Time Event Early Access Too many limited time events you miss out on, due to STORY PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS so far ahead, all of which demand you to have put so much time and effort into a game and pray that your team can actually survive through the stages and make it to those benchmarks.

Don't force new people to miss out",negative
"I love this game! I have been playing since near NA launch, and the game is rewarding even if you play for free. There are regular updates, challenging new content fairly often, and the mechanics and strategies you can come up with make it fun! If you love the anime/manga, history and mythology, or both, it's a fun time.",positive
"It's a good game, and I love that its based off the fate series, I still don't like the fact that you have to farm for everything though; I would love some kind of system for missions you've completed before so you dont have to waste literal hours getting one item at a time, it would definitely make this game a 10/10, also the gachas not as bad as other money grabbers, i usually get what i'm after if i prepare a lil' bit, so thats really cool.",positive
"unfortunately, this game slaps.",negative
a good game,positive
It's a good game that you don't need to pay to win in you can play it without having to spend any money on it you could go through the whole game with only your starter units and it does have a gacha mechanisms and you don't have a auto battle mechanic in this game but it's a good fate game it's the only fate game on mobile to my knowledge,positive

It's a lot of grinding but that's to be expected of a gacha game. Sometimes I take short breaks when I lack time, but I can't stay away for long. PS 12y rating is inaccurate.

oh well it lasted for so long and they made the gacha f2p unfriendly. i used t get new 5 stars from saving quarts but yeah i mostly get useless 5 star cards that i dont really need made almost all 4 star characters to max NP cant even convert the extras to get 5 star characters. it's make me really sad. to see a childhood game turn into a pay to win game. i prefer other games and spend money there. don't recommend this one for people who is going to be f2p. good luck eveyone,positive

"Far above your typical mobile game, this is a visual novel with a gacha component. Animations and art are beautiful, soundtrack is masterful. The game rewards ""whales"" but is very F2P friendly at it's core, with free units being part of the meta just as much as gacha exclusives. The only mobile game that has kept me as a concurrent player for more than a year. Still going strong, been playing since launch till now. (06/16/21). UPDATE: Still playing as of (06/02/25).",positive
one of the best 10/10,positive

"not actually in English (voices are in another language, despite being English being in the title of the game).

"I was going to write an essay but I'll make it shorter. unfriendly gacha, free 5 star you will realize is useless because outdated. gameplays fun but tedious. takes too long to get rewards for clearing stages. if your not a fate fan don't waste your time. it's designed to be played constantly until you catch up and god knows how long that'll take.",positive
awful gaming experience. if you have not tried the original VN then nothing is really explained and as a fan i absolutely hated the long winded hand holding. it grew tediously on my nerves and got uninstalled before it even remotely hooked my interest,negative
"Fix your garbage game, its not letting me in or play the game, keeps saying, ""failed to connect to server""",negative
"It has many good stories. It has lots of good characters. once you get past the first main story arc, the game devolves into unfun boss fights one after another. The game is insufferably laggy at times especially in lostbelt 7's map and raid boss. The gacha rates are awful and so is the pity system. Nobody rolls story banner unless they are new and it should give us a free 10 pull on story every month.",positive
The storyline is great but not worth the effort later on. When the game mechanics is designed to have you wipe and use laystones or saintquartz. I spent more time reading and searching to get past the main storyline and still fail then playing the game. FGO has lost me as a spender and player.,negative
"I keep losing my account when I haven't played for a long time, I thought I got it saved since I got the same phone to play on it but my account is just gone.. I wish theres a skip tutorial.",positive
no real pity and one of the worse gacha systems. Just watch lore videos on youtube and skip the game.,negative
"would have kept the app around if it was easier to recover my account. I say that because the game can get boring real quick for me, especially when the game would rather make you spend money for more and better servants",positive
"Best of all time!!! Great Visual novel with detailed design on each character all in a turn based role playing game, you should try... The only issue is gacha I suggest you save your Saint Quartz for your Favorite servant!

"I loved this game for years, but the Ort fight alone is making me want to stop playing. I can barley get past the first part of the fight due to my lack of 60 or more 5 stars. I can't move forward in the story without the possibility of spending hundreds of dollars on summons, only to get 1 more 5 star that's not gonna make a difference. As a tip to new players, DO NOT burn any 3 or 4 star servants unless necessary.",negative

"Great game, I've managed to play through the main story and get a handful of rare servants completely F2P. You don't have to spend money to progress, only if you REALLY want a particular servant. That said, there are a few areas for improvement. Grinding materials is a massive pain and there's no auto-play feature. When you do decide to try the gacha, the odds of getting specifically what you want are quite low. The story is amazing though, that's easily the best quality of this game.",positive

Craft essence...so sick of those words anymore. most people, even the ones that played for years, only have a single character of the 5 star characters and they pay real money. the rate is dumb and I think it's on purpose for more money. I stopped spending real money till this is fixed. and the game is FULL of amazing characters, so give some out!",negative

"There is nothing to do in the game beyond farming, advanced quests, and story. No type of endgame to test accounts or any type of game mode to pass dead weeks. If summoning rates weren't as garbage, people wouldn't stop playing. There is literally no incentive beyond story to play this game which is completely watchable online. What is the point of this game then? $1000 plus dollar account for a game with nothing to play.",negative

My honest review on this game is really ¬≤ bad because of the lack events and the gacha system which is super bad the rates were bad and the events are always about fighting not rewards and stuff and the daily log in??? rewards are suck and it will take 2-3 or more days to get 30 crystals like what??? I must say this is the most ick games for f2p players it's only fun at the beginning trust me...(still play it tho),positive

"A gacha game of old, that has failed to keep up with its contemporaries in any meaningful sense. It is stingy compared to many of the more recent gachas to gain traction, and events barely differ from one another, making the game feel stale after this long a runtime. Grail Fronts, the gameplay mode that shakes things up the most barely occur. The game needs to adapt to the times, or it will languish, be it sooner or later.",negative

"I've been playing since the start of JP and back then it was way horrible than the newer reviews here describe. The game got better overtime with the system updates and really peaked with its story. FGO is in general a mix of a VN with a battle system and Gacha mechanic. No matter how old the game gets, players will still comeback for the story update given how great it is written. Currently FGO has about roughly 19+ stories that on their own can be an anime and some already are.",positive
still playing the game and I still agree with the review. I have been playing for years now,positive
the best game I ever played,positive
"Game's data transfer system is among the worst in the industry, and even with the recent 330 pull hard pity you are not going to get most characters you want if you are financially responsible.

"The story is very good, but unfortunately, it's the only reason you should ever install this game. Coming from a huge Fate fan, the gameplay loop is excruciatingly repetitive and not worth investing your time into. Also, the UI is very dated, and coming from a studio that consistently makes the top 10 in global gacha earnings, there's no excuse for that.

This is the worst gacha game I have ever played. You have better odds playing Genshin and getting a 5 star to constellation 6 before you have a chance at even getting a limited 4 star. Just buy Fate Extella, it has a fun gameplay, story, and is not a gacha. Top it all with a terrible support staff.",positive

So im changing my review compared to other gatcha games released in recent years fgo really needs to shape up and evolve dont get me wrong the story is still top tier its servents only get better but man the gatcha just is not worth it because either A you get the servent or B you get nothing and just waste sq so they really should do pity carry over because nothing is worst then going 200 sq deep and getting nothing and then it all go's away so until changed im done with fgo.,positive

I would have given 5 stars if not for 2 flaws I think need improvements. Overall great game love the graphics but the drop rates are abysmal and 1 pity is 600 dollars. 9/10 pulls are nothing but craft essences and usually not a good 5 star craft essence. Seems certain craft essences have a lower chance than others cuz getting copies of trash ones is extremely common.,negative

tezcalitpoca final fight. and lostbelt 7 as a whole is an utter disgrace and should either be updated to be fair or removed entirely the gall in that final fight to give the boss a free revive and permastun your party is a joke and every other tez fight is just jankily made. ORT was the best part of this lostbelt and the only fair fight I think I actually have hatred for a fictional character for the first time in my life with daybit the cheat.,negative

"The writing for some of these events is awful; cringe localization and typos are not helping.

"Was an active player since August 2017 and finally quit January 2025. Let me just say, the ONLY selling point of this game is that it's the main ""Fate"" game currently. As a gacha game, it is probably the game that respects its players' time and money the least out of all the popular ones out there with terrible gacha rates and very little QOL improvements despite the budget it no doubt has. There are other games just as/more enjoyable out there that you will not waste as much time/money on.",positive
There needs to be a quality of life update in the summoning system. You can't use tickets for a ten pull only individual even when you have a lot more than ten tickets. In other games you can use ten tickets for pulls instead of the summoning currency (saint quartz in fgo) for the ten pull which saves time.,neutral

There is no auto battle function and each battle and story drags out. In a time where you want a quick battle. This game just elongates the time spent on it for very little in return.

Addictive. Strong and amusing story. Attractive servants art but as of recently the art has become ugly. Servants are hard to get(gatcha). Some summon banners are believed to be fake and not with the possibilities written in their info. Some bosses are very hard to win for f2p players and sometimes they have to spend Saints Quartz and at a point I can't even win with spending these because I have to have a certain servant (Kama avenger) for lostbelt 7 and now I'm stuck in this point.,negative

As an F2P, had to save up SQ to get only few 5 star characters.",negative
"I want to know what idiot decided that in order to play the new valentines event, you needed to have the new 5 star servant. I spent 150 of my saints quartz that I was saving up not only did I not get the stupid servant, I didn't even pull a single 4 star servant. I saved up so many stamina apples for this too. Horrible game design",positive
So far good experience. It's a gacha game so it'd even take years until you get the character you want.,positive
Drop rates for featured servants are abysmal even if there is rate up. Game constantly lags and crashes. I literally cannot play the game when it crashes a few minutes after opening it.,negative
Waifu material everywhere. You want any history character as a anime guy or gal? Bam! Fate got it. Mordred as a tomboy with daddy[Mommy] issues? Bam! Fate got. Jeanne De Arc if she was evil and returned? Bam! Fate got it. Plus a thicc story and banging cast [Look it up]. Absolutely great time playing this game. Also you can only pay for summons.

You have to waste 300 dollars/330 attempts before they actually help you out and give you one copy of the 5* SSR. This game is a gatcha scheme for old men that live by themselves w money to waste on waifus. Deleting it right now. Highly recommend to avoid this game.",positive

"I love this story so much. I'm quite a ways in as of now, but nowhere near caught up, I'm sure. The gameplay is good and is well designed for touchscreens. It has a gacha system that you can pay for more chances at, but just progressing gives plenty of currency. I don't think it's a great place to enter the Fate franchise, although it will eventually explain Fate's lore more than sufficiently as you progress. I was already a fan of a bunch, but not all (yet) of Fate's media, and this is great.",positive
"I've lost my account 3 times, but I come back everytime. the game has a lot of grinding. it's fun though, and the story isn't so bad either. has a nice community that's more than willing to help. honestly the game would be perfect if it had a built in fga system so you could grind even more while you sleep or need a break or to multi-task. rip to that guy who lost his account and to the circe guyü§ßüñ§",positive

"Excellent storytelling and music. If you're a fan of the Fate IP, you will not be disappointed. As a gacha game, there are better options where drop rates and gameplay are more lucrative, but they never quite live up to the story this game has to offer. If you're unwilling to spend hefty amounts of money to get SSRs, be prepared to rely on your luck, but if you're willing to look past that, you'll see a masterclass in modern sci-fi fantasy that remains unmatched even in 2025.",positive

Imo the pity should be lowered to 300 saint quartz or around 150$usd. (Which is still WAYY too high). Or the price to buy saint quartz should be lowered.",positive

Compare to it's competitors, the game is mediocre, saved only by the story and a huge fan base the publisher is too happy to exploit.",positive
"The game itself is decently fun My major gripe is the absurdly small chance at getting 5 and 4 star heroes (seriously, 0.8% for a 5 star on a chance up and 0.006% when it isn't?!) Not to mention you get an insane amount of unnecessary craft essences that you'll never use. PLEASE separate Heroes and Craft Essences from the pull lists! If you do that, you'll still have only about 2% for a 5 star hero but it'll actually be noticeable that there's a ""pickup"" moment for the hero.",positive

Poorly managed. The company is constantly looking for more employees to take advantage of and management has lied to users and gone back on promises.

"Not a bad game overall. Bulk of the quality lies in the scenario writing and characters. Gameplay's sufficiently deep that you'll find new things useful and new uses for old things sometimes. I'd advise a new player to invest in their mid- to low-rarity Servants, and to be carefully calculated with their material usage. Drop rates for materials are so low as to make mistaken expenditures almost disastrously bad. (This has been marginally improved.)",negative

"A slow burn of disappointment. It was fun while it lasted, but the longer I played it, the worse it got. The repetitiveness of it all, the lack of QoL mechanics, the unforgiving gacha, and the obsolete gameplay that makes Chess and Solitaire look advance.

"Fate/Grand Order is one of, if not the worst top-revenue gacha game in the industry. And just for one single reason: It's stagnant. It all boils down to a simple schematic of: If money get, then why do anything? And it's been like that for years, repeating ad nauseam. Gameplay - same exact thing since release; characters - flavor of the month; story - just watch on YouTube. It's not worth playing. The biggest crime a game can commit - be worthless, unless you are someone with sunk-cost fallacy",negative
It's not a bad game but the drop rates for materials and of summons are horrible. Then it's hard to even get to 30 crystals so when you get thos crystals that you worked so hard for them do a summon it's like all that hard work was for nothing. It feels pointless to even try.,negative

With the amount of money and fanaticism being poured into this game it's crazy how little the devs care about their players. Almost 10 years on and your account is still at risk due to no Google account sync. Pity is still disgustingly high and doesn't roll over. Servant coins only got increased when called on their bs. I'm in it till EoS since I've sunk thousands of dollars into this game but I don't recommend you do the same. Go play a game that respects your time. Story is excellent tho,positive

The apps instability is getting worse. I have tried to play on two separate devices this week. And the app keeps crashing. Especially when I enter or exit the saints quarts summon menu.

Games like HSR pushed gacha forward, we don't need to be able to get every limited servant as f2p but I've had years in between getting an SSR in this game. Events are same old, same old. Real story content is few and far between. It feels like they dropped an anime and stopped caring about the game. Please catch up.",positive
"""That's hell you're walking into."" This gacha game is notorious for its terrible pull rates and horrible gameplay. In fact, its so bad that a wiki is needed to even properly understand how this game works.

The game has great and engaging basis and very high-quality tie-in multimedia, all thanks to the overall setting. I prefer the tactical turn-based combat over any idle games, and the sheer amount of characters is pretty much unmatched. Story has some wonk, but is often very enjoyable and silly. The ingame currency is quite expensive, but the monetization scheme is not predatory and f2p is fully viable.",positive

The few chapters that are good, are great. The gacha is terrible: ‚Ç¨30 for a 0.7% chance at a jpeg, with no grace for terrible luck. The art is also an extremely mixed bag. And the grind...

"It's a fun game with a lot of stories and servants to collect. As a fan of the series, I am invested in the characters and story content. I love all the different art styles for the character cards. The only negative is that grinding can be a bit monotonous, and the gameplay gets somewhat repetative over time. The story does do well to balance that out. Overall, I would recommend it.",positive
Customer service is terrible. They'll palm you off and literally just tell you they don't care about your request and they'll get to it when they can be bothered. Don't even care if you've spent a lot of money on the game. They just don't value their customers at all. Absolutely disgusting practice and I would honestly look into other games.

"Decent story decent gameplay, but the biggest issue guaranteed now is servant coins. Which are an item needed to unlock passive skills and level them to 120. The amount you get is pathetically low and they force you to gacha more copies of units that provide no benefit after hitting NP 5. They have stated that they are aware and working on it.

"No gacha game is good. Everything is done to make you spend more money as you support a predatory system. No one should be recommending these games to new players. Predatory monetary systems aside, playing these games is simply an inefficient use of time; they are incomplete games and have incomplete stories. FGO is no different. Its story, touted as the best among gacha, is mediocre--subpar if we consider games with decent stories. And its story is its selling point, FGO's gameplay is atrociou",positive

Story is the good part. Gacha is worst. Barely a pity system requiring 330 summons aka over 900 quartz aka 480 US dollars. And when you hit the 5 star early ends the counter. Pity doesn't carry over at all. I'm still here due to sunk cost fallacy,negative
"I like almost everything about the game. The story, the characters, the animations, and the music. The reason why I gave a 4‚òÖ rating is because this game doesn't have a sweep function. I know this game is old, but I hope it'll get the sweep function someday because it's really time consuming if I do every event stage one by one. Especially myself, a newbie who played since July 1, 2024 is struggling on doing these event stages repeatedly without sweeping them.",positive

It would be great if they make 3 months per GSSR. Many players like me and my friends can afford that much GSSR but not 3600 SQ.",positive

"Truly the worst gacha on the market. It makes sense why they continue to lose business to competitors. Story is solid, fair amount of content to keep the game reasonably fresh after so many years.

"Eh, the sexualization of certain characters is a bit much at times, but the story is rock solid, if a little convoluted at times, as should be expected of anything carrying the Fate moniker. Gameplay is fairly intuitive, though it's worth noting that while the designers try to keep each Servant 'balanced,' their focus is always on narrative first. So some 5 star Servants are rather wimpy, while one of the game's best supports is a 2 star. Also, check your room for Servant dialogues. Worth it.",positive
I want to say this game is 5 star worthy but with the way the gacha is with no pity system and low odds it's really hard when you reach the late game and don't have stronger servents to help carry you along.,positive
"It's pretty good. Gacha still sucks, though",positive
"As much as I give all my love and 5 stars to this game, there is no options to buy Saint Quarts for us non US players. I am now put into a position where I am forced to be free to play even though I want to open my wallet. Come on guys don't region lock this game thats cruel.",positive

The dev is like hermit who never come out of their cave to see how much QOL the other games have improve so far. They just don't want to improve their player QOL at all.

"It's a great game to play. The story is excellent. Though there are some bothers. One is a better way to ascend our characters which goes into the next one. Add the skip feature/auto battle feature.

Lacks most common QoL features that others Gachas have. Dupe System is fundamentally flawed due to poor rates. (At least among Servants.) Lack of bundles.

It's even possible to plan for future unit releases.,positive
"A visual novel with terrible gameplay between and after every srory node. Pity that doesn't carry over and requires 300 pulls for a single unit, outdated animations, sprites and design philosophy in general, a waste of time in most cases, since you are required to repeat nodes time and time again, with no incentive to experiment or even use most of your characters. New enemies that make old units obsolete and reward you from having duplicate units, by saving you time on beating nodes faster.",negative

Also keep a record of Everytime you log in.

Some of the worst rates I've seen in gacha, slow qol updates, (It took almost 10 years just to get a bad pity system implemented) 2 year time gap between servers, outdated game engine, insanely boring core gameplay loop, ridiculously grind heavy.

Great game it's just that it crashes most of the time probably depending on phone model (in my case I use a samsung j4 plus) hoping that they'll resolve that kind of issue or otherwise the only probable way to smoothly play this game is to get a phone model that is a much more advanced,positive

"Still a great story, but the content has been going downhill for years. Less reruns, longer events, skipping seasonal events, etc. Also lacks qol things that every other gacha has, and the ""pity"" is abysmal and broke the banners which made 4* servants way harder to get. Also hostile to new players, as you miss out on lots of good free units and events that you have no way to access anymore. Great story and characters but it feels like a gacha from 2013",positive
"I've lost 2 accounts to the embarrassingly outdated account recovery system which requires you to keep track of a long list of niche and specific details which you wouldn't be prepared to answer unless you knew you were going to lose your account.

"What is it: The main story functions basically like a Visual Novel with turn-based Rock-Paper-Scissors combat as the actual gameplay. Otherwise, it's a Gatcha game. The story is pretty by-the-numbers early on, but the writing improves after the first few chapters. My only complaints are on how unforgiving the gatcha is with drop rates and how slow Lasangle is to update animations. The game is almost 7 years old (10 for JP) and it shows on a lot of older servants.",positive

"Compared to gacha games nowadays this game falls behind. Banners requiring 330 pity for featured 5* that does not carry on next banner is just as good as not having pity at all. No auto battle/sweep or any way to quicken the slow grinding. Worst of all, there's no account sync to Google, Twitter etc. The game's mechanics are too old for this era and they don't bother updating it. If it wasn't for the name Fate that's doing the carry, this game would have been shut down a long time ago.",negative

Worst game with outdated combat and quality of life changes that takes forever. Makes you grind with the worst combat system in the game. Play if you want to but understand that the only redeeming quality of this game is its story and thats it nothing else everything else is a waste of time. Still believe the above but the team helped me get my account back. Process was overall simple and the team helped me get it back within a few days.,negative
I've always lived the fate series and the take on historical characters. Especially now that so many of my ancestors have joined the ranks. I especially appreciate the adding of Charlemagne due to the fact that he is in fact one of my ancestors that I can draw a straight line to. Would be nice if I could summon him. However I understand it is a game of chance.,positive

"Rating has gone down to 2*s for gatcha rates. If I sped the equivalent of $200 in summoning materials, I expect at MINIMUM to receive at least one Sr, preferably one featured on the banner, not 30+ craft essences that I will never use because they aren't one of like 5 meta essences. It has by far the WORST rates of getting characters that I have ever seen in any gatcha game ever",negative
Fantastic story and very diverse roster... honestly though the one thing holding this game back is its absolutely horrible rates... for context. The pity in this game is 300 rolls. Ive played this game for 6 years. And even i cant think of a reasonable viewpoint for that. Especially since the game only gives about 420 to 450 rolls a year.

The saint quartz system is kinda harsh but once you really get into the game and you know what's up then it's not too bad.

Either way there's allot of options for entertainment with this game/franchise despise a few nitpicks with the handling of certain characters.",positive
"After playing the game for over 5 years I can tell you the game play has changed very minimally over that time frame. The only changes happened in the case of a new unit coming out that let's you farm better, these units are so good in fact it feels like a p2w when you have them and it's miserable not having them. Your game play only changes slightly based on class advantage and in the current set up you can ignore it completely. There's also a huge lack of end game content and goals worth grind",positive
"The lack of modern gatcha QOL features such as auto battles, but the game still requiring quite a large amount of grinding could be improved. Some of the older units are in need of buffs and animation updates to keep up with the newer ones however. The rates of the gatcha could be MUCH better. The meta of the game somewhat takes the fun out of it, with powecreep being in full swing, just so that the grind is as short as possible.

Also locking events behind progression is very unfair(i.e. having to complete Lostbelt.2 while im the way in Babylonia still, not fair). Please stop making events locked like that.",positive

There are so many servants to choose from so it has a great character selection. Things I wish it had was more character customization but you don't need to worry about seeing yourself allot I guess just would be cool. Some animations are great too but lags sometimes when wllot is going on. But still smooth of an app. Good mobile game to get your Fate fix.",positive

"It became one of my main games lately. I will be looking forward to the next journey, too. Although if only the GACHA rates system are good, this game has the most worst gacha system ever, and their shop to buy gems are just too pricey and expensive, ya know. Not for dolphins to take much. You really need to whale over if you really want to get those juicy SQs. HOWEVER, the game does not require you to buy SQs when clearing content or grinding, okay? Don't get misunderstood on it. It's F2P OK?",positive
The story in this game is extremely good and even though the character summoning rates are kinda garbage the game is still enjoyable and can be played with any character.,positive
straight up one of the worst gacha systems in any gacha game i've played. Expensive if you want to buy quartz and the rate ups are HORRID. Don't bother spending money. Maybe don't even touch this game all together. There are better gacha games out there if you must play one. RATE UPS IN THIS GAME ARE A LIE,positive

Because I needed to remember my servant and other thing I couldn't remember. I wish they could make Google game accounts connected to the game a like AFK arena. That was only a thing I wanted to happen. But nope I had to started over again, again, and again. For game that need password to order change the device is really ridiculous.

Edit: Okay the pity roll is nice but it's ""kinda not that F2P"" atleast make it like until 10 multi's then only one guaranteed rate-up 5-star would show up and the rest is RNG.

"Overall, a pretty good experience. The over-acrhing story is definitely worth the time if you pace yourself (cause there is a lot). The combat card system is actually quite fun and I can't really think of a game that does it like this currently. The Gacha is probably the biggest fault. Too many characters, most of which are never brought up again, and it all leads just murky rates and horrible power creep. It has a good foundation but still needs some patchwork.",positive

"It was good at first but playing with it for a while, it became stale and boring. The gameplay is simple and straightforward, story is okayish with the world building being 10/10, the gacha system is horrible, and overall really; the art of the servants and the animation trailers is what carries this game. The only thing I'd wish for it have, is a gameplay similar to what Punishing Gray Raven has; the fighting I mean. 1/5 stars because, as I'd mentioned, the art style is what carries this game.",negative

"Great gameplay, great story, great characters, the gacha is ehh but the welfares/low star servants are good (some being best in slots for certain uses) and jp being 2 years ahead makes it possible to save enough for np5 of a servant. One huge issue, there isnt an actual account system. Makes it really hard to manage 2 accounts on the same device, or getting back your old one (Ive lost 2 accounts, one actually had good progress)",positive

So I suggest you avoid this game and find something else to play.",positive

The writing is consistent, the mechanics are still evolving 5 years in, and the number of ways you can play the game and have fun continues to grow. Best for Fate fans and gacha hell survivors.",positive
"Update: the lag is fixed but I'll never get my hopes up, cuz everytime an update appears it goes bonkers so only 4 star for now since it's not consistent",negative
"Been playing for a while, but being incentive for the long term, just isn't worth it anymore. The gacha is pure RNG with no fall back of reliably getting the 5* except pure luck, I guess I only enjoyed the game since I was a Fate fan back then, but the story itself isn't quite the best either.",positive

Hell grind! Sure it's hell grind and if you want to get your fave/target servant you need to sell your soul to the devil to grind the amount you need for a guaranteed servant since the pity can't transfer to the upcoming banners. But nevertheless since it works that way and there's no auto so you need to farm manually I indeed made a contract with the devil and enjoyed myself playing this game AND YEAH YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT CONCERNING ABOUT META BUT INSTEAD WITH WAIFUS AND HUSBANDOS!,negative

I'm a former FGO player and I gotta say that the game disappointed me overtime. The story and characters are great as ever but the gameplay is incredibly dull. I'm a person who loves turn based games but the way they execute this concept is very boring. It just revolves around looping your noble phantasm for the billionth time. It's not fun. The only fun you get from this game is the CQ or the boss fights to some extent. I just wished the gameplay system was different.,positive

The devs pursued the whales for meta and the game has suffered as a result.",negative

Boss fights are often terrible, I highly doubt the developers even actually playtest them to see if they ARE playable, such as the Lostbelt 5.2 fight with that Alter Ego, you won't even have a class advantage against him unless you have a Pretender, which there's only ONE of.

Been playing this game on and off almost since release and the steady downgrade and power creep is gotten insane. The most recent update has really cemented how out of touch Lasagne has become. The first raid bugged and auto completed due to a bad interger settings. This means loss of resources for the current banner characters and bond levels due to doing the raids. And the apology we get is just sorry here's 10 sq. It takes 30 sq for one 10x summon. 1/3 a summon when the pity system is 330.,negative

Bit when you get to the Camelot singularity (which might take some time) the writing takes a full 180 and becomes godlike, and that good writing stays for the rest of the game.

But you got plenty of strong 3 stars and free 4 stars which can help you on your way. I'd say it's a good game!",positive

"Crashes: Sadly the crashing issues are back, never wants to run in the background half the time. It seems to be a gamble on if it remains stable. Gameplay: It is fun to make teams of different cultural and historical figures that have plot and personality twists. I wish the gacha pity system was not so bad-- 320+ summons is a lot to get your character and premium currency is expensive. Unpopular opinion, but if they did a battle pass for monthly SQ I'd get it. FGO is addictive and enjoyable.",positive

It's very cool game but unfortunately once you don't get a transfer code when you get a new phone you cam transfer your progress which sucks. I tried contacting support by email but I received no answer from them to solve the issue.,positive

"It's a real shame when you've played this game for years and because of the constant updates the game crashes more and more, and even if your a paying veteran player even with all the evidence you give on purchases who you are they will still not help you get even one of your servants back. I will always be a fan of the show but I am no longer a supporter or fan of FGO. Also to be safe I wouldn't fund this game anymore.",positive

I needed to transfer my account when i was doing it, though it said transfer failed and when I tried to use my other phone to go back to my account it logged out of that phone and I couldn't go back because I didn't have the transfer code, went through customer service for 3 DAYS and in the end they didn't give me my account I stopped playing because I don't want to go through the same thing.",negative

"I've been playing this game for around 4 years now, and I can safely say that it is a really good gatcha game. Its characters do a really good job of taking history and finding unique but historical ways of representing them. The gameplay is engaging for a turn-based RPG. The game does a good job of making the lower-rank characters still have legitimate usability, so the game isn't pay to win. The story is very engaging, albeit time-consuming. Good even for people who are new to the franchise.",positive
It is a good game with good mechanics and good plot but the draw gacha is unfair and ridiculous 50draw i got 5star servant but after banner i used 70draw not a single 5star servant show up thats also reason this game is bit dissapointing yea the free 14days to get quartz is useless to get 5star if the chnaces are low also no pity of stacks. The other reason this game is bit not playable because the account cant save to other savable site like others games.,negative

I have decided upon further consideration to give this game 5 stars but I will warn the Gatcha rates are horrible and stupid expensive but the story just keeps getting better,negative
"Enjoyable turn based game, nice character designs and story. Play responsibly.",positive
"Tbh the Gacha is pretty bad but there's a friend point Gacha system which is pretty good for F2P players. Story is very good. Gameplay is very solid. And Events are very well written and very memorable. Since I am playing for the story, I think 5 star rating is pretty much deserved. If you don't like grinding and not a reader, plz don't even think about playing this game.",positive
"It's okay, the story is the only reason most play it. Other than that rewards are horrible, rate-ups are laughable, and the daily mission rewards are hardly something to be even thought about. I mean who thought of this? A monkey with a type writer? You should take notes from a game called Destiny Child, very good rewards, gameplay, and rate-ups. Not to mention buyable items that help you summon more characters. I can see why Fate can't do this, you have a laughable amount of characters.",positive
Your average predatory Gacha with blatant p2w mechanics. Don't play unless you wanna waste months grinding for a character that's barely usable. Trash game.,negative

"Worst gacha I've played. Lowest rates I've ever seen. Way too many materials for very little stamina to even farm for them. Extremely unbalanced fighting system. Requires way too much farming for materials, exp, etc for very little returns. Almost forgot about the terrible optimization as well. With an S22+, the game on the lowest settings, and following multiple trouble shooting guides online, the game will constantly freeze up for 5-15 seconds.",negative

"I like the story. Not so much for all the gender bending of historical characters. The loading is slow and you can't skip animations for attacks or noble phantasms even if you have seen them 50 thousand times. A lot of these noble phantasm animations are very long and eat up time. It would be nice if this game had skip tickets to help with slow loading grinding nodes like Dragalia Lost has. The drop rates for upgrade nodes are terrible as well. Also, would it kill them localize the voices?",positive

"While the Gacha is not the most fair in terms of its rate up % for a certain servant, the story of part 2 aka the lost belts are a worth while experience for a Type Moon/Fate Fan. Part one and the singularitys before the lostbelts are a mixed bag but again, are worth while reading.",positive

"This game is the ultimate gimmicky scam. Every single aspect about this game is designed to milk as much time and money out of you for nothing in return. The drop rates are woeful and it's not like the cards have any tangible value anyways. So you are shelling out an arm and a leg for what is ultimately pixels on your screen. Everything else from the QP, AP, EXP, and everything in between is designed to be as time consuming and grind-y as possible. Cool artwork but this game is pure trash.",negative
"Have been playing the game for 5 yrs, and while it's a harder game for newer players ,based on the current story, it becomes more fun the longer you play. Challenge quest are down right impossible for newer players so if you are reading this and are new don't get frustrated if you can't tackle challenge quest. The story is fun, but the gotcha can make or break a team. Fortunately even lower servants are useful to playing the game. It's 4 stars because...Gatcha, but its not as bad as others",positive

"Been playing for 5 years already, and I still love it as much as the day I first played it in 2018. It's one of the oldest gachas that's still ongoing, so it really impresses me it still has so much content, and a story now that puts any of its competitors to shame. The gameplay is outdated for sure being as old as it is, but the characters, story, and charming events will always set FGO apart as a cream of the crop. Bruh, I read Lostbelt 6 for 8 hours at one point, and I didn't want to stop.",positive

Game is not without flaws, the grinding can get repetitive, the story is slow and boring in the beginning but it gets definitely better later on. If you like Fate media you gonna have a good time",positive

"I've been playing for nearly 3 years now and never regret spending time for it. Although sometimes gacha sucks and dead weeks pretty often, the main story is worth to read and very impressive, especially LB6 story. Character designs are good and unique. Many ways to earn sq.

I'm only playing because of the characters and the story and not so much for the gameplay. Many ppl will tell you that the pull rate for this game is the worst out of all the gacha games.

it's gacha is extremely bad and predatory as well it's pity system is garbage it's impossible for a f2p player...you need 900 saint quartz just to get 1 guaranteed SSR servant and that is one of the issues. the pity system is bad. If the pity system was change that you get the SSR servant in 15 pulls you will get more people into buying saints quartz. It's better than what is being offer right now. Until something is change for better you get 5 stars for the story but 1 star for bad gacha rates.,negative
I think I try fgo at least once every year and every time I remember why I never stick with it. the game itself is a very solid rpg and it can be rather fun. The lack of auto can be grating sometimes. It's just the gacha is terrible and 330 pity is equally bad. The fact it used to be worse doesn't help that I just feel repeated disappointment then leaving. If your a fate fan or don't mind just going with the flow it's a definite must try but if you are a impulse buyer it's best to stay away,positive

"Nice fgo , best turn base and Anime gacha game . Although sometimes I'm disappointed because 1000 SQ only gets NP 2 SSR rate on. Sometimes 1 - 10 summon tickets even get 3 SSR rate off. And since the pity system came into existence, it has become difficult to get a guarantee servant SR",positive
The best mobile game ever. Truly a masterpiece of it's genre. Everything from the game to the character designs is a 10/10. The game is perfect.,positive

I love everything about this game,positive
"After several years, still didn't resolve poorly executed game mechanics from startup like NP strength down and star generation up. Also, very unwelcoming to new players. Some events literally lock out new players. At least give some event benefits for moving through main quest when you can't do the event. Main quest is too long when literally starting from Singularity F. Every time I see an event that I can't participate in, I drop the game and spend my money elsewhere.",positive

This is the most addicting gotcha game I've ever played that doesn't take the gotcha part too seriously. I still have a lot of four star and five star servants in the game that are amazing.,positive
Good overall,positive
"I've played this game for now 4 months, and I love it! It's really fun. If you like action, offline games, and magic, then this game is for you! But I would love it if you developers could make a future update that you could have online battles and could battle real players. Also, I would like the percentage of getting a 5 star servant more likely. Maybe like 1.5%. But I did get some 5 star servants still. But it's a great game! I would rate 5+. But, I would recommend this for ages 7+.",positive
"No battlepass and has top-tier waifus. Some of the story chapters are absolutely bangers. The game's combat can be really rough at times, but once you build your momentum, you are set.",negative
This game is a wonderful experience. By far the best story of any mobile game I am aware of.,positive
"I have played this game for a couple of years and I love it a lot. There is a lot of content on here and it keeps giving more.

The game itself is quite nice. My main gripe is really just how long it takes for the game to load and do anything,positive
Good game. Current problem for me is in the thanksgiving limited quests it says to complete nodes in main quest part 1 or 2 but i have already cleared lostbelt 5.5 so i ahve no main quest nodes to do. Should i miss out on quartz for being too far ahead??,negative
It takes a lot of grinding to get enough currency to pull. And the pull rates aren't even good.,negative
Great game. Only issue is the gacha is unkind most of the time and saint quartz for the summons are not given enough for top grossing.,positive
"Outdated game, grinding is hell and it devalues the gameplay, game still has no auto / skip battle feature after 8 years of it's release, they stop releasing low rarity characters and updating their animation, UI is STILL trash, needs more QoL updates, THE GAME IS STILL 2 YEARS BEHIND FROM JP WHEN EVERY OTHER GACHA GAME IS 6 MONTHS. Only thing this game is good for is the story and characters, the release of which slows to a crawl every year. Latest anniversary made me is so disappointed I quit.",negative
It is more desirable if this has a Facebook or Google save function since the player mostly are playing this for a certain amount of time then delete then gonna download and play again but sometimes the save function for this game didn't really save the game or being misinterpreted as it can be used endlessly but in reality the save function can only be used once and you need to re issue a new save code to use.,positive

"F/GO is actually my first gacha game as a player in Gacha Verse, and I am quite glad that the game is doing great in terms of improving further, if there is something I would like to suggest, that would be implementation of some mechanics such as ""Skip Button"" for the nodes that you have already finished such as EXP nodes and so on, in that way, grinding would be more easy for those players who has almost no time to play the game itself.",positive

So i've had an account for about a year got so limited time servants and in general had a pretty big account. My data got corrupted when i was moving it over to my new phone.

"Pity system makes fun of your time making you do 330 attempts JUST to get 1 SSR thay you can't choose whatsoever Don't waste your time with this one, I'm playing since 2019 and the game sucks! worst % chance ever seen on a gacha",negative

"It may be known as the hellscape of gatcha for a reason but it's unbelievably addictive, especially if you love the Fate franchise. I've invested more (time and money) than I'd care to admit. The story is fantastic, animation is nice and the character designs are beautiful and well thought out. Gameplay is simply turn-based but is somehow still engaging. I've been playing for years and have yet to experience any technical issues. Like everyone else, I do wish there was an email bind though.",positive
I'm not downloading this game do not download SML play and now I can't download this this app is very horrible I'm going to like this game,negative
Best,positive
"Great game, gacha rates are as abysmal as it gets but sometimes it also gets a bit generous so I don't really have much of a complaint. If you're a fan of the fate franchise, there's a good chance you might also get into this game. The story, characters, art and music compositions are just one of the best that I've experienced from this media. Especially in the later contents, the quality of pretty much everything just gets greater and greater, overall its just good. Definitely worth a try.",positive
How do you guys going to do clickbait like that,positive

Lots of content for the fate franchise! Just wish there was an optional autobattle feature because farming can be a bit tedious after awhile.,positive
Very nice üëå,positive
I can't play the game anymore. After the update the game won't load for me. Every other game I have works but not this one. It says to have a better connection. I've deleted and re-installed but it won't let me play. I don't have a problem with other games,positive
Very fun but the gacha will kill you,negative
The order is definitely grand.,positive
Game always freezes randomly for about 3 - 5 minutes. It's really annoying.,negative
"Great story, but game UI seriously needs to be updated. It was bad when it was released, and it is even worse now that their are other more recent gachas that have better systems. No real account binding system either, I mean *come on*! Actual gameplay is boring and repetitive, most of it is farming. That isade even worse due to the constant crashing. Unless you really care about Type-Moon, I really don't recommend playing F/ GO. Arknights is pretty fun if you want gacha and strategy.",negative

Even though it's been what seems an eon, I sent out an email and despite my less than useful information, they actually got my account back. You have earned my eternal gratitude and respect FGOSupport. Also, this App is awesomesauce. Great story and even better characters. Waifus and husbandos galore.",positive
"The game itself is fun but... Gah damn the rate up is a lie, overall the game is good and the game is generous in the gacha currency, good events and good character designs. But be warned if you are planning to play this.. *that's hell you're walking into*.",positive
"Fantastic game imo. Great story with naturally some rotten parts, but overall still a quite good experience. No bs 30 different in-game currencies, and everything is incredibly streamlined. If you want something, you grind for it. It's as simple as that",positive
"The game over all isn't all to fun, and the way accounts work is that you need to have a transfer code in order to recover your account, which is BS. Since they don't even explain this which caused me to loose a lot of progress in game. And account recovery isnt reliable, due to the lack of response from support. A basic link to email would have made the game better for all players to avoid this issue",neutral
Expensive and bad gacha rates but at least the free servants are usable.,positive
"The game is simple to understand and play. The gacha system is less forgiving then other gacha games, but that what's makes this one unique. The story will rope you into the game and the animations of the game will leave you speech less that this is truly a mobile game.",positive
"This game I loved playing but it locks me out of my account claiming a connection issues with I play the game normally on my phone, despite Genshin and Star Rail working. The rolls are beyond bad that it js not even the average rate. Love the story but this game is just not good so far. Something is wrong and reps don't even try to help me at all.",positive
"Account Recovered Phone had a bad update and I had to factory reset. Lost access to my account. Emailed FGO support looking to recover my account. After a couple emails, they got me into my account in little over a day. Amazing support!",positive
Please give me 5 star servant,positive
"It has been about a year now since I have sent an email to support for account retrievel and haven't gotten a reply, even with attachments showing my purchase history. I don't even want my account back now. I would just like to point out how scummy and predatory it is to make account retrievel as painful as possible to make people not want to quit and just arbitrarily decide not to respond to retrievel requests that have all the information asked for.",positive
I loved the game and I played it on computer with bluestacks then my computer broke and I don't remember the transfer code so all my progress is gone. So overall great game but I wish I could get my progress back easier,positive
"My favorite game. The gatcha system is kinda scary, there was times that i couldn't pull a single SSR using 500+SQ and just a couple of days ago, I pulled two featured SSR with a single multi. Characters are awesome, story is great, voice acting is top notch, best I've seen in many games. Prices for the premium SQ are a bit high, I would like them to offer discounts on their SQ shops, still the game is so awesome I wouldn't give them any lower than 5 stars.",positive

"FGO is amazing, aside from having to grind and the gacha system with a barely functioning pity rate, this game beats any negatives over the head with all of its other positives in it's story, characters, gameplay and more. It doesn't matter if you're a diehard Fate fan or a run of the mill gacha game player, FGO won't disappoint and will keep you enthralled throughout the entire journey, every fight has meaning, every piece of scenery has meaning, everything matters, and its up to you to save it",positive
It's a love and hate relationship,positive
The gacha rates are HORRIBLE! I did 40 ten pulls and only got Nero caster( limited time banner unit) from the Pity summon. For context you need to get 5 copies to max out a servant. And more context if you were to buy that many saint quartz(in game currency) you're looking at $250-$300 dollars just to get only one copy. Great story but predatory gacha rates.,negative
Fun enough game but the grind gets a bit boring,negative
"I quit years ago due to constant crashing, lag and freezing on THREE different brands of phones AND connections. Came back because I missed the storyline to the same problems but tolerated them until recent Nerofest updates amplified my issues to critical mass. Support was of no help whatsoever just regurgitating the same steps I already took to fix it myself. Eventually discovered the game needs 10GB free space to function decently before the lag and crashing returned. Enjoy your one star!",positive
I love playing FGO but there's one problem it laagy and it will freeze on Android phone I'm using a 3 phones to play it for one account 2 Androids and one iphone 7 plus this game favor iphone than android I'm using a 2 new phone with 4gb ram and 8gb and new SOC but they're laggy on the 4gb ram will freeze the game on the 8gb it's so laggy but on iphone 7 plus I can play it smoothly please make it optimize same as iphone.,positive

"It's a good game and it's quite relaxing and enjoyable. It's somewhat f2p friendly and it's essy to understand as well. But the problem is that even though my wifi and data connections are strong, it still says 'Connection to server lost' or that the signal was too weak. Please fix this, it's hindering my in-game experience a lot especially since the loading takes so long as well.",positive
A great game when it comes to gameplay however the biggest FLAW is the fact that I can't just use my email address to save or transfer data I've lost count of the number of time I've had to restart because I couldn't transfer my save data thankfully I never spent my but there's nothing more I Hate then losing my progress in a game 0/10,positive
it is a wonderful game closely based on the Anime I love it,positive
"Game is great. Customer service sucks balls. I lost my account when my old phone died and they don't have any way to bind it to facebook or playstore accounts. They then want you to remember an exhaustively annoying list of things. Who remembers their servants, friends names or favourite servant? They ask if you can remember your friend code, if my phone hadn't died with it on it I would have given it to you. Three years of play and event exclusive servants down the tubes. Lazy CS and designers.",positive
Great game. Been playing for a year. Nothing bad to say about it,positive
"The first couple of singulars are a bit of a drag. I've heard good things about the lost belts from my friends who got me into this game, but the start is boring. You'll need to put many hours in to get there. I've played many gacha games, and this system has some of the worst rates I've seen. The UI is terrible to navigate through. On top of that, the transfer code system is very outdated. I wish there was an account system like every other game out there. All your progress can be lost easily.",positive

"This is game is a gacha, and one with horrible pity at that. But I still love the game I don't spend much on it, and a lot of the welfare servants are good enough to clear everything.",positive
The game is good I'll give them that. But it will lag at the smallest things. Open the menu to fast and suddenly you have to wait 15 minutes.,negative
The crashes on this game is becoming a problem if it's gonna keep doing this they might as well just refund people all their money and shut down the servers. While I patiently wait for a new update.,negative
I tried this due to the hype but damn is this good if not for the server kicking out out due to events otherwise it's still impressive,positive
I Like it,positive

The amount of f2p currency you get is very little. The guarentee 5 star is only provided with 1k premium currency. But I'm pretty sure you can beat the game f2p.,positive
I've been playing the game since it came out and have seen the game tremendously improve since its release back in 2017. I recommend the game to people unfamiliar with Type Moon's nasuverse to bring some new fans into the larger nasuverse and its many different stories. I've been a Type-moon fan since the 10th anniversary and it still remains my favorite fictional universe as a whole with its massive lore.,positive
5-star for this game it's fun and addicting at the same time,positive
"An interesting game and to think I started playing this because of the Saber Wars event. The story is amazing with the exception of Orleans to Okeanos. The Art is great, the ost is amazing, the gacha is a complete salt fest, the grinding is a real pain. And yet this game is extremely fun thanks to how usable the 1 to 3 stars are other than that the plethora of event is amazing even though again the grind is a pain. Really I recommend this game to people who wants to experience a great story.",positive
Great story and characters,positive
This is a really great game. Would definitely recommend it. Vast amount of combinations you can do in the game between servant and Craft Essences.,positive

So I really loved this game but lost my phone with over a year's worth of game time. There's a account recovery which I was greatful for.

Heart broken üíî,positive
"This game is great and I love it but since Lostbelt 6 addition it keeps crashing a lot. The most often moments of the crashes are: game start, after NP usage, new battle screen (i.e. Battle 2/3) and battle rewards loading screen. It also once crashed for me during 11x summon. I've tried clearing cache at game level, clearing cache at system level and reinstalling. Nothing helped so far.

Getting high rarity servants is quite hard for free to play players, but I got lucky and got 3 5-star servants, so can't complain that much. The only real problem I have with FGO is the waiting time before each missions or battles, I get that they still need to ready character sprites and all that, but it really is a very long wait. I'd rather download a lot of data for each servant. Update: Fast Loading!!",positive

"This game has the best story for mobile games. There's no contest. I've read genshin, and looked at arknights, haven't checked out star rail but it doesn't matter. This games story is so head and shoulders above everything else it's not even funny. The character designs are incredible, the battle system is tedious but does have depth to it. Ultimately, I would only recommend this game for the long grind, not for casual players.",negative

Everybody knows that this game is one of the hardest for get a SSR character and that would be a very bad thing but is so cool that I can't hate it. The Story, characters, music, art, voices... The whole game is so cool that I can't hate it. Yes, the rates are trash but with effort and don't spend in all banners is possible get the characters that you want.

Have to play same mission 3-6 times just to move on to another one for 3-6 times but the chapter has 15+ sections so you're on same chapter for a good 45+ minutes cuz you can't skip anything but cutscenes. And the free side quests after you beat that one section you gotta do those 3 time to get 1 crystal you can't use till you get 3 to summon something useless.",positive

Aside from the Gacha and the first four singularities being either awful to average. Quality of the game does greatly improve after these segments and the constant updates have given better quality of life changes. It's good. 3/5 Update: Game's current state and ownership changed to Lasengel and they've made a number of massive improvements across the board in qol. But most importantly lost belt 6 released and it gave us the best fate story if not one of the best rpg stories in long time! 4/5,positive

"While the game itself is worth playing for husbandos, it is not worth spending money. The amount you get per purchase is stupidly low if you spend 3.99 you will only receive like 5 saint quartz, it's not worth spending money if your a low spender like me, just grind stages and save up for your fav servant(s). I only wish if skip tickets can be handed out, even if they're just gained through events or missions (similar to how bungo stray dogs hands them out).",positive
"This game is not for you. If you are just getting into fgo, you will eventually hit an experience that makes you wonder if you're playing the game wrong, or multiple such experiences. This is because you havent either been playing for free from launch, or else arent whaling so hard that captain ahab returned from the dead as your exclusive servant. There are simply some encounters that will ruin this game for you, and the longer you waited to join, the more you'll get punished.",negative

"I love the game when it works, but I have to restart it 10 times to get it to work. It refuses to rotate to landscape properly",positive
6 years anniversary currently going on and the best they can do is give you a couple multis to toss at your 1% chance of obtaining a limited 5* servant. The story is mid with some high points but it doesn't matter when the way the game works makes it feel like an absolute slog to get through. For me this game has the least player friendly practices outside of adding qol once a year. The pity for one copy of a unit is about 400$ give or change and if they are dps units they need dupes.,positive
"The story is good, the gacha system is a real deal gamble. But yeah once you play the game there is no escape.

"Played for 5 years by now. Its quality has dropped since Act II. The translations have occasional spelling and grammar mistakes in them, which should not be the case since Aniplex and Type-Moon are involved. The game has developed a habit of crashing for no discernable reason over the last half year or so, which is odd since the game otherwise runs smoothly; I run it on a current-gen smartphone.

"Been fan of fate for quite sometime. Yes this is gatcha game however, this game has true story and characters you truly will fall in love with.

"In my opinion, this is the best gacha game. FGO's characters have more depth and lore to them than any other gacha who mostly focus on waifus. Most gacha's stories/ lore don't stay interesting but FGO's story consistantly keeps me on the edge of my seat. Gameplay is definitely unique to all others. Only bad things I have to say about FGO are its droprates. I would also like to be able to interact with our servants more.",positive

"Performance 2/10, gacha system 0/10, gameplay 7/10. Honestly just don't spend your money on this game, at the very least until they fix game performance. As it stands they don't deserve your dollar",positive
Fate of an Average Order | 6.0/10 | While there is a solid combat system; the narrative is far-fetched and uninteresting. Unlocking new characters is exciting as they are interesting but that is downplayed by the cumbersome menu and user interface design. I would only recommend this to hardcore gacha enthusiasts.,positive
Very very very long loading time. Very long. Just getting into a stage and organizing units before starting wastes a lot of time. Fix your loading time.,neutral
"Nice game, but recently it won't allow me to load into the game",neutral
"Just got the game 3 days ago and it wouldn't allow me to login after my 1st time playing, it would just be stuck on a white screen. Edit: the game stopped doing that after multiple tries, not changing my rating because as it turns out the game is just boring.",negative
Love the game. Even got one of my favorite servants. Though I am confused. I'm guessing the north American version of this game doesn't have any way to redeem codes?,positive
I dropped my life savings on this game...,neutral
"A really bland, personality void gacha games in an already crowded market. Animation is clunky and remniscent of early browser games. Lacks any sort of polish and comes off as very lazily made. Had high hopes for this game as i like the series but it met the minimum expectations which is a shame.",negative
Not player friendly. Forcing players to leave the game by puting ridiculously strong enemies or forcing you to only use a char that is weak against enemy. Take the fun out of enjoying the game.,negative
I love the game and the stories and I like the fact that when I deleted it saved all my progress I'm y grateful for that overall 10/10 but I wish u didn't need 30 saint quartz just for only 11 summons,positive
"would be nice if it wasn't for the too- much-loading issue. i had to wait for a few minutes, because it keeps on loading. a waste of time, and a waste of battery parcentage. for the summoning part, i am so disappointed. it just stucks there and there's no ""skip"" or ""next"" button to click which is very very confusing. now, i get why the review of this game is too low compare to other games I've played. i just hope that the issues I've mentioned would be resolve.",negative
Drop rates are ridiculously low. Gameplay is boring.,negative
The game didn't close properly and erased my game all my servant's I had acquired over the past year.,neutral

"I'll admit, I've wasted a ton of money on this game. But did I have fun, yes, I've played for years now and don't plan on stopping. These reviews on crashes and freezing I've never experienced, I still highly recommend this game to anyone out there who loves anime.

The game literally keeps crashing at the last node of Solomon like come on! If it gets fixed 5 star Update it fixed itself after updates.,positive
Definitely one of the Most Epic Games of All Time!!!,positive
"Updated review: Would have deleted this game long ago if it wasn't for the story, characters, and world building. Absolute worst gacha system in the genre (330 summons for a pity that doesn't carry over). Work on improving the game itself is extremely slow. Many servants need buffs and/or animation updates but are just neglected. This game has so much potential but it's squandered by the developers greed and complacency. Don't bother with this game unless you love Fate or are a whale.",negative
"Lasengle is bad, don't support them",negative
My life has been worse off because of this game. 10/10 would recommend.,negative
"It's really dumb that it makes you downland the update before the start screen, I'm trying to transfer my data to a new device, but I have to update the game in the old one to do that, which I obviously won't play in anymore. That's bad design",negative

Great fun.,positive
"The writing has been fun, seeing how many of these characters would basically act in a more modern world while falling with the main story threat. Of course, you have to deal with a GOOD NUMBER of heroes being gender swapped, but that's been par for the course. The biggest problem is how flashy it can be, and by that, I mean getting blinded by a bright flash of white screen and some having some intense flickering effects, with no way to tone down either, so you have to be careful with your eyes",positive

"The frustration that how many times you roll you cant get the servant that you want. You need ssr luck for this game or thats just how the game is. Anyway i can't stop myself to play this game, it's addictive(for diehard Fate fans). Most recommended game. Thank you developers.",positive

Highly recommend to not only try this game, but also get a transfer ID and save it when you get a good start.",positive
"The game offers way too little information on itself. Servant skills in the game dont give specific number values. An attack up skill would be looked at the same in every servant eventhough some have higher percentages. The rank of the skill (ex. A,B, or EX) dont always mean that the skill has high percentages. Weekly missions and event missions tell you to kill a specific enemy type but NEVER tell you the names that fit. It's a guessing game. I want to like the game but it's hard to.",positive

"Great game, excellent storyline. 1-3 star servants can even compete with 4-5 star ones so you don't really need top-tier servants to clear the game. However the material farming is abysmal, stressful, time-consuming and simply terrible, especially for gold material and secret gems. It would be a much better game if the drop rate for material increases!",positive
I've gone and come back to this game 3 times previously just about to start my fourth time and I am starting to think that's for a reason every time this game has been on my mind the playthroughs from multiple youtubers has given me a sign that I should come back to this game wondering bout my first account but I'll inquire about it later.,neutral

"As far as Gacha Games go, this one is one of the most fair ones I play. Any character can be used at any point in the game as long as you either put effort into building them or plan hard fights accordingly. While the odds for 5 stars are rough, the game gives a good number of strong event servants and materials to where they aren't required to play through the game. Good story and worth playing if you wanna burn time and enjoy historical fiction.",positive

"Visual novel with a mandatory card game in the middle, but you have to pay to actually have the characters. The story is really good, but I found the gameplay to be sooooo boring. Also, this is one of the worst gacha rate games I've played. People save for a character for over a year, and still dont get them. Also, they finally added pity, but its so high it's like $1200 or something to reach it. Scam gacha, gameplay is about as interesting as stale whole grain bread. Just watch the show.",positive
"The game is straight up a scam. This is worst then gambling, at least there you win every once in awhile.",negative
My favourite game,neutral
"Decent if you know the series, and if you're a history buff anime fan. Not that what they present is factual at all, but they do keep the interactions between historical figures accurate. Consistent events, but some gated behind story progression. Can do it all with provided free units if rng doesn't favor you, don't pour money in as that's a slippery slope with their prices. Data doesn't transfer very well so be careful.",positive
I really like the game but my problem is that every time I play it and get off of it go go to another app the game refuses to load and turns to a black screen so I have to re download it and start all the way back over,positive

Another thing, please improve the data backup system. Needing to re-issue a transfer code when switching devices is a hassle.

"I beat the first arc with a SSR who was one of the worst at the time and using only story support when possible. While being meta does help in some of the harder fights and with grinding, it is not necessary at all. Like all gatcha games, it's something of a ""lifestyle"" game and you'll often find yourself in a schedule to play it. The game notoriously lacks content however. Weeks can go by without any worthwhile events. I mention this because most of the stuff you want will come from events.",positive

Also there will be some times when a character's skill animation or Noble Phantasm lower frames or even freeze the game, however this was never frequent and only happened whenever I had bad Internet. Other than that the game's story has the same quality as any other from the Fate franchise even during events. The gameplay is unique for a turn based RPG and easy to understand.",positive

The worst free to play ever. The American server is 2years behind jap!! Has the lowest rates ever and when you pull for units you can get completely useless equipment instead of actual characters. Horrible translation and no auto play system. Super stingy game I don't know they are one of the top earners still with a horribly dated system. Do not support this go play something else.,negative
"The gacha rate is one the worst for gacha games. Even with the pity system, things can go really bad at times. Events also have RNG, leaving you out of getting the 5th copy of CE to MLB it. The game could be great but competition has greatly surpassed FGO in terms of gacha rates e.g. Genshin where players are more willing to open their wallets.",negative

"One of the worst in terms of rolling in gacha. Is the lowest ssr rates that I know of.

Pity is only once, if you pity or get the rate up once, it's gone for that banner forever. It doesn't carry over.

"You could beat the game perfectly without a single SSR, until the Lostbelts. The difficulty spike is pretty big and if you don't have a five star with the required skill set or someone who could tank hits, you're done for. Rates are bad, so you could already imagine how much of a pain it'll be. I was one of the lucky F2P to get quite the amount of SSRs, but no support servants. Yeah, if you missed out/don't have Castoria, Waver, Tamamo, Skadi, or Merlin, good luck on lostbelts. Le epic wack RNG",positive

"I love the characters in this game, their personality shines, the art is great, and the story has me invested. However the game is so boring and such a grind fest. Gameplay is basically a matching card game and you get basically nothing for completing quests.

If this didn't require so much bandwidth that it crashes when ever u try to do anything i wouldn't be giving it a -5star but u cant give that so have to give 1 star but please fix been trying the same level multiple times manage to do 1 attack out of 3 then it stops responding as it requires a 100% perfect imternet signal with absolutely no lag or drops whatsoever unless u have that this game just can't be played which makes this game suitable for a console but not a fone fullstop until u fix it,positive

Other than that controls are simple, game style and graphics are good and storytelling is interesting from time to time.",positive
Fun game but too pricey,positive
Really solid Gacha game that actually feels like it has okay rates. A lot of the lower star characters are actually useful and can be used in strategic ways. Only reason why I put 4 and not 5 stars is the pity is crazy high especially because pity doesn't carry over like most gacha games now.,negative
As a new player and long time time fan of the series I have to say I spent more time on this gotcha game then I would like to admit but there's good reason the story is amazing and they have done a great job at giving even lesser know heroic spirits some time in the sun and unlike other games of a similar nature you can beat the games story with low rarity units you don't have to priorities high rarity ones so if there is a low rarity character you love you can take them into the end,positive

"Recently stopped working at all on a Moto G6. Game itself is decent when it does work, but the old school JRPG feels quite dated.

"I would like to give it a more meaningful review, but it simply does not run in my Moto Z2. Instead of all these illustrations, I only saw a blank screen. I tried it in a Galaxy S20.

It defeats the whole purpose of playing a gacha if I am only going to use 2 hereos when the game allows me to use 3... Potential is there but execution is poor.",negative

Sadly none worked and I'm afraid of losing my 2 year progress. Damn sorry fgo, but without a patch 2 stars is all I can give right now.",neutral

"This is not a great gacha game. It is NOT beginner friendly. Rate up is actually a lie, rates are way lower. Save your money, there is no ""reasonable"" pity gacha. You effectively have to use $1k per banner for maybe ""pity"". There really is no reason to continue playing NA when the other regional servers are ahead by 1-2 years. Story is good, but if you're here to get the characters you want... good luck because you're never getting them. Also game crashes consistently for some odd reason.",positive
"The story is very good and the excellent characters bring everything together lovelily. That said, the game is a tad old in machanics althought the events do keep it very alive if you're OK with farming. Why is it a 3 stars then?! The gatcha. The business model alone is irksome (with the whole predatory angle) but FGO even to this day still manages to be worse than most. You can ""make do"" with free characters and the like but if you're one to not be able to let go if you fail at a roll go away!",positive

Story mode gets out of control without some good 4- 5 stars, cause some enemies can one shot. No free 5 stars unless you go back in time or wait for a free banner that comes once a year.

Despite being a gacha, is a masterpiece.",positive

Kiara swimsuit had her right breast nerfed, and now is smaller than her left. Anyone nearby can easily interfere during a summon and basically hijack the 5* data. Zoomed the camera out like 2 updates ago, now characters are hard to see. Support was phony and lost 15 encrypted skins. management is so stupid, killed the game.",negative
I swear it must be just me then but I still never get characters I literally only get essences in almost every 10x draw or 3 star characters it's getting bs why haven't the creators fix this already so everyone has equal opportunity especially if people can't spend hundreds of dollars on a game not everyone got money,positive

Nice when it's not crashing. Version 2.40.4 doesnt work. It says there is a new version. Clearly there is not... anywhere...,positive
OK so I've played fgo a longggggg time. Then took a two year break. This game is dated af and has an abysmal summon system. Saying that I don't think any of the summons are necessary and since the game is entirely single player it's not p2w. Although the top tier supports really help. What is good is that your old servants never become redundant. Edit:1 star I didn't get Murumasa,positive
"Pity is heavily needed otherwise it just pushes more players away, especially newer players. The game is honestly good but its gacha really needs some sort of pity system or at least a top off to at least give players who opt in to pay some sort of incentive.",positive

"I like the game because I love fate and for a gacha its age it'd be unfair for me to nitpick at its gameplay loop, the only reason this isn't a 4 or 5 is because these rates are abysmal I've been playing for a year and I've not received a 5 star servant since the anniversary and I'm lucky to pull 4 stars servants from time to time, Craft essence bloats the banners significantly because the rates are upto 3x the servants",positive
"This is a great game but i gave it 3 stars because of ""Failed to connect to the game server"" , i have to use a vpn to make it work which is annoying because i have to open it everytime i want to play.",negative
"Definitely a worthwhile game, but only if you have self-control. It goes without saying that it is a gacha game and one with a 1% chance to get a five star servant. Depending on the type of phone you have, you may experience crashes, but most issues are usually fixed before they become a problem.",positive

However, I have no choice but to stop playing because the issues render it nigh-unplayable due to the lag. Would I recommend? Yes. But I recommend caution until the issues are fixed and the screen freezing is addressed.",positive
"It would be so good that you can link your progression to a facebook or google account, so you don't need to transfer your account to any new device. The lack of this feature is what prevents me to rating five stars.",positive

I was way further in this game with lots of great summons but once I uninstalled it and reinstalled I couldn't get my account back and whatever I do it would only start from the beginning no welcome back player or anything just from the start so my honest suggestion is please connect your game with google or fb or anything so that player could return and get their data back and not start from scratch again.,positive

Lately, there have been a lot of moments where the game lags and hangs, but other than that, I still think it's a fun game after playing it for years already.",positive

"Guess I'll give an actual review. When it comes to the gameplay itself it's standard turn based with extra mechanics that are diffrent enough that it dosent feel stale. Even when not taking the new jp update we just got. If you don't like gacha then don't play the game man cause, even when pity gets added it's still a pretty high cap to get to. So how you feel about the gacha is probably gonna be a big make or brake for you. Besides all that though the story is amazing both main and events.",positive

Great game. Unfortunately even $500 can't buy you your desired servant. What's the point of even a supporting a game that barely has a pity when you can't get a single copy of your desired character. You're better off playing Genshin Impact because they too have a great story and at least they have a pity system. A shame because I loved this game.,positive

"I used to really enjoy playing this game, but I unfortunately have to give it a terrible rating due to recent problems. I haven't been able to play it for several months now due to constant crashes after and often before reaching the title screen.

I have missed out on numerous events and limited time summons because of this.",negative

There's also the issue of it randomly crashing out of nowhere and suddenly freezing during farming sessions that makes it nigh unplayable. For those planning to play this game, don't.

I mean, it's not the only game that has long story dialogue (that is kind irrelevant unless you actually care about the entire backstory of the universe) and character cliches. Some cliches are usable to get the audience interested, but when they get used constantly. It becomes repetitive and you'll hate them in general.

"Great story, appealing and well written characters, and meh gameplay loop. What is the problem? The gacha. This is closer to gambling than most other gacha in the point that's there is no reasonable gurantee for low-to-mid spenders or free to play. You need about $400-500 dollars to gurantee a single copy of a 5 star charscter. Pity doesn't tranfer either, so you're left saving for a long time if you wanna stay free to play or low spender.

"Was probably good back in the day, but for new F2P players, years of power creep and an absolutely PITILESS gacha make this just not worth it. You can still beat stages with temporary ""friend support"" characters that can be totally OP and carry your party, but at that rate, why not just watch it on Youtube or something. You're not really playing yourself, you just watch someone else's party fight. Old 5* characters are nearly useless for the current meta and you're not getting even those at 1%",positive
"I wasted my money o this goddamn game, I want a refund. I tried to go back in the game, but the entire gameplay is artificially extended so you have to pay to win, even if they give you the means to acquire servants, you depend on the banners to get characters that have multi hit properties to actually build a proper buffing NP or quick damage enough to pass, old characters still have single hit animations and sup bar skills. The old backup system is gone so you can't recover your old accounts",positive
"This is impressive. Never before have I experienced a game where the creators seem to care a not single bit about their players as this game tbe last few ""updates"" that were supposed to fix bugs have instead only caused it to crash sooner and sooner.

This Christmas event for karna Santa is the most unfair conditions ever.

"Great game, in fact, the best mobile game have played. It's a bit old on some aspects but the gameplay is good and the story is fantastic, although it does take a bit of time to really get going.

"The current bug of crashing is basically stopping me to play the game, as i dont have the patience to keep re-opening the game over and over again in the hope that it works. Other than the bug, i absolutely love this game. Note: its a phone problem of mine, as on my tablet it works completely fine",positive
Really good game. Just wish the game would sync with progress between devices.,positive
This is one of the worst mobile games put out to date. The servers are so unforgivably slow that it really takes away from the experience. The fact that the developers have the audacity to charge you for anything when they can't even put out a well functioning game just shows the state of the game industry. I've uninstalled this and won't ever be playing it again.,negative
It is a good when you are able to grasp the macanics. Highly recommend guides on YouTube to become more familiar with the game and it's different servants.,positive

crash..Crash..CRASH all this game ever does now is crash every chance it can get it's actually infuriating! This has been happening since the Las Vegas event ReRun and they STILL haven't fixed it! The crashing and black screens just keep getting WORSE! The update that was supposedly gonna fix all this was suppose to happen last month and where is it?? I genuinely love this game and it's story I've been playing since it dropped so I hate talking negatively but things need fixing NOW! FIX THIS!,negative

"Never dealt with a game so disrespectful of your time. They've removed easy access to LB Event CE's. No skip tickets or auto-rerun. Yet they release new units and stages that counteract each other (2 units 2nd wave) in regards to farming. Login rewards are mediocre, and the Login events are an insult. Seriously, you miss one day and you forfeit all rewards. What kind of event is that? Why log in after missing a day? Events being gated to Lostbelts is rough, especially for newer players.",positive
The game was great so please deloper can you create an account sign up that when you enter a game there's no other opposite that I can borrow some other characters I mean that my own character so it will be good if just like that ü§î but it's great so I give 4 star for now if you can do.

"Rates so terrible it'll give you a mild depression after not getting anything but trash after your well saved SQ. This game is CRUEL for no reason. DON'T PLAY if you're looking for a gacha to chill into because it requires ALOT of time and effort for you to get the materials for leveling up, and events are HELL to as it requires to play everyday. The story is awesome though (literally the only reason why im still playing this game), it makes up for it's very terrible dogsht gacha rates.",negative

I am a real sucker for this game. I play this game daily. Story: 5/5 and there's alot of it in this mobile app. You will be entertained for a great while. They're not short like other RPG games. They're v long. This game is mostly story telling! It's the strong point. The story will make you love the characters. / OST 5/5 never disappoints.

"I have no complaints aside from the brutal rates in the gacha. The unique thing about this game is that even the low rarity units are very viable even for veteran players.

FGO had set the precedence for every other gacha game that has since been released.

It's casual and non-competitive, SSRs aren't required. Lower rarities can do just as well.",positive

Second it doesn't have any sync account like Google play games or Gmail it's hard to recover your progress when your data is lost. Next is the summoning of servants, it's really hard to get 1 SSR class servant the game really gives you a low chance.",positive
I hate reset in this game on certain time it will kick you to the main menu.,negative
Unplayable. Game tells me to update to play but app store won't even install update,positive
"It's not p2w it is kinda f2p but you don't need SSR servants to clear challenges, some low rarity servants actually outshine SSR servants. Stories are decent, character development is good I love some of the characters. Game isn't too hard once you understand the mechanics and don't waste resources. Pull rates are bad and censorship is weird, for example Emiya had his skin color changed to a lighter tone for us while JP has him in his original skin tone.",positive
I tried to download the app again cuz I felt like playing again but it said i couldn't cuz i needed 1500 pb i don't know what that is but I don't think it should be saying that.,positive

Game is great. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and the story and events are interesting and fun.

Also, the game doesn't have pvp, so you don't need to get a lot of copies of a character if you want. The design of characters are awesome and the voice actors are top tier.

The gameplay is among the worst I have experienced in any gacha games. It is absurd that in a such a grind heavy game each time if you farm anything you have to do everything manually. The gacha rate is absolutely horrible and the later part of the game including the story chapters(the only saving grace of the game from my perspective)are unfriendly and unforgiving if you don't have good units leveled to a high level as it force supports on you. & they don't care about their player base at all.,negative

"Strategy RPG with gacha mechanics based around a series I enjoy a lot. The storylines have a steadily increase in quality the longer you play exceptions being the events and Part 1.5 and it's best to consider a visual novel with a game attached to it. If gacha doesn't interest you, the gameplay, story, & lore might hook you into it. The in-game currency is easy to get early on. You'll rely heavily on events if you don't plan to pay for it though with an occasional pay to roll event twice a year",positive
"Biggest issue? Drop rates. While a new spin on lower level units still having function in the game, and the idea of investing into them to be on par with some of the higher ends... the prospect of a 1% drop for a 5* and 3/4% for a 4*... is both disheartening and a huge potential cash sink for those needing a key unit for end game.

Servants are numerous, with something for almost everybody out there. They come in a white variety of visual designs, play styles, builds, and power levels--but investment can make anybody work using. It also has some of the best art and music on mobile. The game is in A, but once the story hits Camelot, that becomes an easy A+ and stays there.",positive
Crashes on my android just recently every time upon startup. I've tried clearing cache and data but it it still crashes upon startup even after restarting my phone.

Story is great but out of all the gacha games I played this one is by far the worst one. I used over 300 saint crystals to try and get 1 5 star servent and only got a lot of 5 star craft essence and only 3 star servants. It woldent be that bad if grinding for SQ wasn't so boring. And purchaseing SQ from the shop is way to expensive just to get 42SQ is $40. This game just feels like a cash grab. I'm done with it and I'm telling my friends to never play this game.,positive

The gacha aspect is pretty harsh, but friend supports and rewards make up for it. The entire game can be beat with only free units if you want to play that way. The waifu-to-husbando ratio is pretty balanced as well.",positive
I really enjoyed this game for 4 days. That's when a new update came out that made me unable to get through the title screen. All I get is a white screen.,positive

"It was really fun to play, but after a while it got laggy and the game said that reinstalling or clearing the cache would help remove the lag issue.

Still can't get back in, even after foolishly reinstalling the app, but I did have my Code saved, so as long as you guys don't delete my account, I'll be back eventually.",negative
Many bugs in the game please fix,positive
"The game itself is nice, but the localization team is awful (as in they rewrote certain sections 'because they know better' as they put it) and it feels like they aren't even trying to keep their player base, putting the bare minimum effort in everything they have to do. This also translates in updates breaking the game on many devices (who needs tests on a game that rakes in millions, right?), terrible communication and the likes. Great IP, great writer, great art, terrible everything else.",positive
Great game but after playing for 2 days the Game wont Load in to tge Start up it will only be stuck on a White Screen please Fix this...,positive

"26 ‚Ç¨ more for the Saint Quarts Pack (almost 40 %), for no real reason other than to keep up with apple store... not even increasing the Saint quarts amount for your packs. Thats just not ok to f** over your whole EU playerbase like this lasagna (even more so with everything escalating in EU atm). If you would have adjusted the prices like you did over in Japan it would be fine for most people, but this is just been greedy now.

"The story is great, especially if you're a fan of Fate series (or TYPE-MOON games). The gameplay is repetitive though (different gameplay only on events). Rarely crashed, but often lagged. The Gacha is harsher than other games but it doesn't mean this game is P2W. You can win using low rarity Servants (equivalent of character).",negative

"Game is fun enough, but the last few updates have consistently ratcheted up the crashes, with the latest being to the point where every attempt to get past the title screen is met with an immediate crash. Reinstall did not help at all, so now I'm stuck and can't even access the transfer code setup feature to try and move my account to a new device.",negative
"There are plenty of good low rarity servants which have fun playstyles, so even without a lot of 5 stars you will have a good time and be able to clear content. The story is pretty good too, and it's a very fun game overall. Part 2 is even better than most of part 1. Recomended to Fate fans, and for those new to the series it's a nice hook. Only complaint is occasional errors when certain updates occur and the game crashes, but it is currently working.",positive

"The experience is great, the mechanics is interesting. But the sync account is the problem, this game has no sync account like any other gacha games but they have game transfer. I have experience a bug that after entering the main menu of the game the screen turns to white screen, the solution is to reinstall or clear data. Wasted all my time grinding and playing, I even pulled Altoria and Mordred in my first 10. I hope they develop a sync account on social media like Pricone.",positive
"This game is good when you can actually play it. I was lucky of thinking ahead of time and transferred my account to my old iPad. That transfer was over a month ago. Before the transfer it crashed a few times but at least I was about to do something in the game, now it won't even get to the start screen and gives me the option to either restart, retry or clear cache.

Earlier today I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game to see if that would solve the problem (yes, I have plenty of phone storage and I made sure the game was updated) but it didn't solve the issues. Please avoid playing this mess until these issues are resolved or you'll just be wasting time.",negative
"The story telling in the lostbelts is amazing. I only wish that you didn't have to spend more than 100 quartz to get a 5 star, sometimes you don't even get a 4 star. Getting SQ for f2p is hard enough as it is, very time consuming to farm. Gameplay has gotten better, but it can still improve more.",positive

It's far from perfect, it's not the best gacha game out there (let's be real, it all depends on one's type), the gacha is truly hell, and I'd say I'm just a really lucky F2P player. Gameplay is not for everyone that's for sure. But the story really is what really pulled me in. While the early chapters were lackluster, the big picture is that I got to experience a grand adventure through an altered world history with the heroes I learned of as I grew up. Peak fiction.",positive

Fairly good in it's gameplay mechanics and story but even if it doesn't have good gacha rate... It should've atleast have a pity count of 200-300 or something...

Because I can't get my transfer code since it only displays a white screen. Please fix.",negative
"Would highly not recommend this game if you're not a fan or at least familiar with the Fate series, convoluted story, boring gameplay, and tedious grinding would turn the newcomer and casual players off this game. And even if you're a Fate fan who happens to have a particular favorite character in this game and you want it, get royally f**ked by the 0.3% gacha rate or grind and prepare 2 years worth of gacha pulls. There's a line between sanity and patience y'all, grind for 2 years is the former",positive

"As a massive FSN and FZ fan. I Love this game. Graphics, the fight system the lore and story. Nice all around. And the servants from the anime series is good to have. The Negative? RNG on gacha is as bad as the Korean base games. Forces you to spend money. And yes you can just farm Quartz for free. But farm 600 Quartz and still not get the servant you want. You even get non rate up servant spooks. It's Disheartening and makes you lose interest playing the game. Good game. Scummy devs.",positive

First problem with constant app closing during event periods was fixed but 2 months later it's happening again? For 5 minutes the app kept closing withing a minute of opening and getting through the main screen. Always seems to happened during the timed event. What's the point of having these events when you're going to have these bugs and people can't even enjoy the event? Update: new event started (not sure if it even did) and I can't even make it to the page to claim my daily rewards.,negative

I have 1000mbs fibre internet and a Samsung S22 Ultra in New Zealand and I have to wait quite literally 5-10 minutes per cutscene. Doing a 10 pull took nearly 30 minutes waiting for characters to introduce themself and my game just refuses to load between, before and after missions.",positive
It's all good but There's a bug that doesn't show my farmed materials,positive
"Game needs a rework. Why hasn't there been a feature added to have battles skipped, or auto play function? I do a lot of missions that are no brainer clicks, and couldn't be bothered to see the boring content to farm material ten times over.

Really, grinding is all you need to do if you're up to it. Takes A LOT of phone space so don't get it if you don't have enough gigs. GREAT GAME!",positive
Latest update made the game literally unplayable. It crashes after every battle sequence and then resets. Contacted developer and the reply basically stated that there was no fix coming until November at the earliest. Can't farm in a game that is built around farming for materials so it's basically an anime app. Been playing since launch and cannot express how unplayable the game is now.,negative

Now it's actually impossible to play the Christmas 2021 rerun since the app always crashes when I try to log in. If I'm lucky enough to select a quest, it either freezes in the loading menu or crashes as soon as the battle loads. I don't know what happened, but Lasengle needs to fix it ASAP.",negative

"I've been playing and paying in this game for quite a while, and the last update actually decided to make me write a review.

Not much else to add really.",neutral

New update seems to have made it worse. Tried refreshing game data 3 times. Even tried reinstalling which I found out means I have lost my account.",negative
"The new Saint Quartz update is a disgusting breach of trust. People in europe are being punished due to Apple increasing their monetization, even if you use Android. The least Lasengle could do is to match the increased price with increased amounts of SQ, but no they just want to be greedy little rats.",negative
This game is great (though extremely p2w). It is playable as a f2p which is slightly refreshing though there seems to be an issue when using noble phantasm or generally playing as it crashes or freezes.

"I started playing Grand Order in 2016 on the Japanese Server, this game is a lot of fun and helped me get into the series BUT the 5 star drop rate (1%) and damn near dependency on them in certain arcs and raid battles does make this game ultimately a money pit unless you grind till insanity to build up a unit of 1~4 star characters (5 stars are the best cards in the game but you can complete a majority of the game without them).

"This game is fun, but has a lag problem and is really grinding bent. The reason I gave it a 1, is because if you accidentally delete your game or delete it and want to re-download it, everything's gone, and there's nothing you can do. Unlike games such as clash Royale or clash of clans, which saves your data, this does not. Any limited time event servants? Gone.

The servants and story are well written though, especially if you're a follower of the series. Lastly the gacha isn't forgiving, so expect to not get a 5‚òÜ and it might spare you one day",negative

"I do really enjoy the characters and the gameplay quite a bit, there are definitely problems tho, like to the lack of animation updates for some older units, no Story replay or proper account system and a pretty outdated Ui. Also the current lack of a safety net kinda makes the Gacha part just into literal gambling. Not to mention that the current powercreep is getting more and more of a problem and the pace with that the story progresses is quite slow. Overall a like a 6/10, ok but not amazing",negative

"Introduce a pity system of some kind. The game introduced a lot of things to keep you productive and farming especially for new players getting a stable roster. Though it almost doesn't matter if I get hundreds of thousands of quartz annually when there is no pity to guarantee anything. People would be willing to dump money for an eventual pity pull even if it was a spook or dupe it would be something. Also banner rates are trash, at least do a pity for those so when we hold quartz it matters.",negative

"Single best narrative-focused game on Android. On the gameplay side, there are gacha mechanics for building your team, which you can power up through grinding. There are also a lot of limited-time events that give you tons of resources and free exclusive units, if you can put up with the grind. Outside of that it's just reading, but it's a damn good story. If you can take it easy on the grinding as to not burn yourself out and just enjoy the story, I recommend this game whole heartedly.",positive

All in all, as someone who played this game for 5 years, and who also played many other GACHA games, it's a 5/5 game.",positive

"Good story and character design. Severely lacking in a lot of aspects when compared with other gachas. No pity system (JP has one but you have to spend nearly $5k for it to kick in lmao), no auto farming, accounts are not linked to anything other than a transfer code and if you lose it you are SOL, and even though its an older game some animations still make my galaxy s10+ lag.

The Game is good. But the loading screen is terrible. you need to optimize your game. it always lagging,negative
"$800+ = ZERO 5* characters. Gacha system has no pity system either. Story and event progression is locked behind having specific units for certain encounters. Possibly the most unfriendly game for new players. Don't buy into the hype, the story isnt that great. Game mechanics are still archaic too. Have fun baby sitting your device while farming mats with no auto or multi-run options. There are too many better gacha games to waste your time on this one.",negative

"The game has an absolutely phenomenal story that I enjoy greatly. Unfortunately, for the past several months the stability of the game has become almost nonexistant. Trying to do missions makes the game crash, and sometimes it takes a half dozen or more log-ins to clear one mission if it let's me play it at all. Reinstalling fixed it briefly, but doesn't work anymore. If they can fix this, I will move this to a 5 star review.",positive

"The farming is nightmare-level with an awful summon system. That favorite waifu you have? Yeah, good luck getting her. 0.04% chance and that's just level 1.

The story is okay at first, then becomes truly something special later on as it discovers it's own identity, the gameplay is good and is an interesting spin on turn-based RPGs, and the character designs are generally more appealing and unique over other gacha games. However, material grind is awful, and the pity system - INCLUDING the JP-only system at the time of the review - is absolutely a joke.

"Gacha rolls are suffering, everyone should know this. If you don't think you can cope well with that, best to avoid this game, as it will toss you 3 star after 3 star whenever you can save some summon currency.

"This game has an amazing story. Each characters has their own thing that makes them special. Events are fun and sometimes silly or sad.

I emailed support and in 2 days I got my account back. I recommend downloading this game.",positive

After playing much more of this game and actually thinking about the game play I've come to live the fact that all the Characters from 1 to 5 star can all be used in almost every piece of content.

Four out of five only because I did not know much about the Fate universe.",positive

The game has a unique and fun story, surprisingly fun combat, funny community and most importantly of all the marvellous characters to get. The only downside to the game is device you use as it may not be able to run the game. You need at the very least 1.5 gb or preferably 2 gb to run the game, you could also use an emulator to play on pc.",positive

"Finally available in NZ, best news ever",positive
"Overall, The story and character cast in this game is impressive for a gacha. It starts off slow but the later chapters and characters really draw you in. It's got comedy, action etc and It's pretty much a massive visual novel but it's for free. Gameplay starts off simplistic but the content does get harder so beware. The music for this is also excellent and diverse. It also uses soundtracks from other Type-Moon properties like F/SN and KNK. I give this game a 5/5. A good game to play on the go.",positive

"FGO has a great storyline, cool characters and a nice soundtrack. Playing it is like being the main character in a visual novel with battle segments when you get your summoned servants to do the dirty work in battle. It can be a very personalised game depending on how you raise your summoned servants, but for me personallly all of the good stuff ends right there. The grinding in this game is tiring, events are super long winded and require lots of time/ dedication. Gacha rates are a sinkhole.",positive
"Mechanics are easy enough to understand with more depth than you might expect. Nobody beats fate in terms of waifus, but make sure you can keep a lid on your spending or the gacha WILL ruin you.",negative

Would give 4.5/5 if possible. Massive amount of content now for new players ( some meh, lots good).",positive

"This game is made for those who enjoy a good story. For those who DO NOT read the story while playing, they wouldn't enjoy the game. The game also has a dated combat system that needs improving. The account binding is perhaps the most glaring issue because you can only have one active account per device and to transfer account data, you need to get a code in-game and then use it on your new device, which most gachas moved away from. Lastly, game crashes periodically after recent updates. Fix it",positive

"Excellent gameplay and character depth, story telling is one of the bests right now",positive
While I do think this game's story is probably one of (if not) the best stories available to play on a mobile phone there are still flaws in the game the main 3 that I can see is 1. Low chances for a 5* and there's no pity system currently but even in the future that pity system is still very much lacking 2. There's not much variety in gameplay it's just 1 gamemode and nothing else. 3. There's not much in quality of life features. While there are probably more these are the most apparent for me.,negative
Rates are terrible. Have lost my sanity already playing this game. 10/10 would spend 1500sq again.,negative
"Great story, Great characters, Great art and visuals I do not reccomend playing this game. Possibly the worst gacha system compared to most gachas(fgo since 1st month and a near decade playing gachas worth of experience) to the point where you could spend over ¬£1000 and still not get the unit you want; crushing your desire to play the game.One of the best stories in any medium and some of the most loveable characters in fiction only for you to sink ¬£400 and recieving salmonman.

I disappointed of myself how I drop playing this game when it first came to US. I only come back continue where I left off after seeing the anime. And once again how I am disappointed how the anime didn't follow the game storyline. Soo the Visual Novel game of Fate grand ordee storyline is way better than the anime storyline",positive

My experience so for has been amazing. I know some won't have the awesome time I have so far but what I will say is that you do need to spend money if you want to have a great time playing this game and don't be too reckless with your money and be bothered not having the gold servants as begin to play the game. Just enjoy your time and if you feel like donating the gatcha banners aren't that bad either.,positive
My favorite franchise. The story is really well written after the first 3 singularities. A lot of events with good comic relief to take away the pain from the main story even if just a little. Graphic wise is amazing and each character is unique. Very hard grind but worth it at the end. Like all gacha is a hell of his own but I like this hell a lot. Highly recommend.,positive
"First off I love this game and anyone looking for a fate/anime game go for it. But that dose not mean it doesn't have its problems. First is a gacha game and you need to know that. While is gives you plenty of fee curancy from completing the story and free quest as well as weekly challenges, it often takes a stupid amount of saint quartz (the main currency) to roll for the heros you want and that is my only real gripe about the game other than the grind or materials and the here and there bugs",positive

"FGO, is a super fun and interesting game for anime fans and history buffs alike. Like, even if you are not fond of anime, the historical figures they play around with is so cool.

"The stories and plot lines of FGO are incredibly compelling. The game play is pretty straight forward, utilizing a turn-based battle system. You collect heroes from history and folklore via a gacha and strengthen them via farming materials. The gacha rate is poor, with only a 1% chance to draw the most rate heroes; this is low compared to other games like granblue fantasy, and there is no mechanic to ensure you receive at least 1 rare hero in every 100 draws.

"Pros: Great story Nice characters and character arts Excellent voice for characters Cons: Too Grindy Less rewarding Takes a fair amount of time if you read the story and clear the stages Getting high rarity characters is rare even if you are a paid player , so F2P would have problems in the beginning.

Updated as of 12th July 2022. My advise is to please find another game rather than wasting time playing this scam game with scam rates. 360 quartz and 36 summon tickets later and only 2 Summer Brunhilde but no Moon Cancer Sessyoin Kiara. I get more craft essences than units which are mediocre and useless. The only good thing saving this game is the storyline/plot and the servant art. Can't wait for the pity counter to happen where I have to use estimated 900 quartz to get the 1 character I want!,negative
"STORY Just what you would expect from the Fate Franchise, that is, awesome MECHANICS nothing special, gets boring, desperately needs qol, manual grinding in 2022 is stupid GACHA probably the worst gacha experience, VERDICT as a long time fan of Fate, I was overjoyed with the release of FGO in English If you're here just for the gacha, there are better games out there",positive

Funny thing is, I'm actually trying to get a specific 4* star and i pull 60 times only to be rewarded two 4* stars that: 1. Don't have their rate up. 2. Already have and have never used. I'm not asking for much, just half what's being promoted. I'm honestly so glad i stopped spending money on this avaricious gambling mess of a game.",positive
"Integrated 'luck', probably the only thing random is when assigning this 'luck' when first creating an account, the gacha seems like 0.2% but internally has a multiplier which uses the account defined 'luck', don't know how that works exactly (prob. 0.2 * n), you can test it and see it after some time, lucky accounts always will be lucky, unlucky ones will always be unlucky, nice game but still, don't spend money if you think your 'luck' parameter is low, it doesn't affect your luck variable so",positive

The games layout is confusing. Everyone keeps trying to reinvent the wheel because they think it will make them famous. It just shows how little they understand about making a truly good game. The characters look nice better then most games. And the battle system is neat but without reading through every skill year swinging wildly. The original rpg format for turn based games is still the best.,positive

"Gameplay as it is looks very basic and simple.The characterization, voices and variety of characters are impressive for the most part. Unit balance is done such that all unit rarities are usable. Events offer a ton of variety in gameplay and content. Draw rates are average and saving is very important for desired units. On the other hand, major problems are the lack of a pity system and the extremely long AP/energy/stamina recharge which can take as much as half a day. Story is also done by varying writers which can affect the quality, with some being great (for a mobile game) or somewhat terrible and shallow. Nonetheless, it's a great game for everyone especially for those interested in historical and mythological figures/events.",positive
"I think this company should change game's age restriction to 18+, I have found this game quite inappropriate (especially the attack animations).

"Fgo might be older in terms of other gacha games, but the lore and love put into the game through it's story and characters is breathtaking. All the characters stand out one way or another, even mash a servant that you get free has a ton of love put into her.

"Don't get the game unless you're a big fan of fate. Reasons being is the grind is real and repetitive, the events try to diverse themselves and are honestly pretty fun but it waters down to farming. Not to mention the horrible pull rates, if you want a specific character, you better pray to some godly force you get them, not even 1000sq can guarantee you'll get them. It doesn't help that the summoning pool Is filled with trash craft essences that make it harder to pull anything good. üëé",positive

"I kept hearing that it's pay to win. It's not, characters/servants basing on what stars is bad. Because it sets the mindset of new players to get a 5‚òÜ and soon curses the game since they didn't get their waifus or husbando. Always remember that farming materials and EXP cards can make a 1‚òÜ-3‚òÜ as OP as 5‚òÜs out there. Never go with the flow, create your own team out of the norms. That's what makes this game fun.

It's always preformed really well and I've had very little issue with it, only crashing a handful of times over several years. An issue I do have it that the game freezes and stutters after playing for a few hours or when my phone auto suspends. Sometimes for a rather lengthy time. Closing and reopening usually fixes it though.",positive

Love this game huge fan of the series,positive
"Been playing since release, and while many complain about the gacha rates, they're really not bad considering 5 stars aren't necessary to beat any content. Skills and NP effects are more important. Sure, some 5 stars are game breaking, but only if you have the right roster to make the setup. The only thing I had to complain about was fixed with the 5th anniversary. The game is still a bit grindy, but unless you spend huge to get all the SSR's it shouldn't be too hard to grind what you need.",positive
One thing i hate about this game is how on release they region locked it.,negative
"So umm. The game is great and all because of the ""old"" yet nostalgic type of interface. The gameplay is simple, and the story is fantastic. All you just need in this game is patience and time grinding for saint quartz. (Also, the droprates are hella low). But anyways, i love this game.",positive

Pros: Servants' splash arts are very well detailed most characters get a different portrait after ascension. Story is alright. Events are long. Cons: Expensive 79.99 for only 50 spins at the slot machine. Certain servants only available at certain times of the year. No auto battle after completing previous stages. Drop rate for 4* & 5* servants are very low (used around 200+ premium currency around 65 spins only recieved 3 4* servants 6 4* equips 3 5* equips). No pity system. Battle system slow.,positive

A very imperfect game but still truly enjoyable. Gacha rates are low but everything can be beaten by low rarity servants. The story is really amazing and it's what kept me playing for years.

Fun story but there is hardly any effort into making the gameplay more exciting. No pity after so long. QoL changes take forever. For a game so well known and how much money people put in you would think there would be more effort into these things. Game is way past it's prime as even 1.98$ mobile indie game has more exciting gameplay than this. The only saving grace nowadays is the art and story. But who plays games only for graphics right?

I can't even summon without the game crashing. Everything I start a mission it crashes. If I finish it then it crashes. I can't even play for more than 5 minutes. Using a Samsung s10+ that I can play anything else on. Very sad. (Edit New update and tweaking with settings has allowed me to play the game properly. Has been very enjoyable the story and content have been pleasing and I look forward to finishing story.),positive
No tutorial for connecting it on media platform it's great tho can someone help me?,positive
"Loved it so much, Mechanism of this stragegy game",positive
"I was really close to pay for quartz today and I dont wanna go to that path, My one problem of this game is that theres way too many gameplay and fights with it that I cant progress fast enough to catch up to the story, my decision to play this in the first place was because of the amazing story and characters but I just dont have enough time to progress cuz of thr long gameplays but overall I still give this a 5 star and I will miss this game so much and its already giving me nostalgia",positive
"It's like Dark Souls, but with more waifus.",positive
"I love it, the best game ever!!!",positive
I went to update the game and was surprised to see a number of negative reviews. I've never had an issue with crashing and such. I also tend to play on phones that aren't older than five years so that might be why. At one point I put this game down and lost my account and the support team was able to recover it very quickly. This game highly encourages in game purchases but there is a huge community of f2p players that love it all the same. There isn't a mobile game I love more than this.,positive

"The epitome of a gacha game. You'll most likely play this game not for the gameplay itself, but for the characters and the amassing of resources. It feels good to get rare servants and build them up, and the actual rpg combat is simplistic yet still enjoyable. If you play these types of games, give this one a try, but if you don't know what gacha games are, or even anime for that matter, then I don't think you'll find much to enjoy.",positive

Best Gacha game ever!!!!,positive

The game has some of the best story telling I have seen! The gameplay is simple yet can become complex as one progresses through it and the characters are each well written! Recently the game has become really laggy and would stop for minutes at the time. It does take the fun of the game,positive
Not half bad,positive

"Phenomenal story, relatively fun gameplay, great collection sim and super convenient in terms of time sink. The only downside if any is honestly those rate up drop rates but even then it's not as bad as most other gachas where your character will become useless later on.",positive
Not bad but there are better fairer games also slow update and translation times with poor rewards and communications from the developers. Play for the story and the events are pretty fun but the game can be a total grind and tedious to play at times really outdated game system as well (edit) they added a back button a small step in the right direction still a 3 star game tho. Major issues with account transfers as well cant transfer back to old devices.,positive

"This is as good as gacha games get - that's the justification for my rating. Sure, there are no auto functions as in other games, but that means you will learn how to actually play. Additionally, I have learned that auto functions always mean that there is more grinding to do than is physically possible. The time taken grinding in this game is actually slightly less. The story is alright, definitely could use some better writers (as could this review). It drags.",positive

"Great mechanics, strategy and amazing story, but is overshadowed by how anti-'Free-to-play' it is. Most of the great story is locked behind an RNG resource grind and a combination of high prices for heroic spirits and a slow earn rate. I've played multiple mobile games like AFK Arena and Azur Lane and this one is by far the worst for F2P players. TL;DR, Good game ruined by greed.",positive

However lately the updates the game has made are on and off with crashes and sustainability.

"I have been playing for a while and other than a hiccup where I lost my account a few years back, the game has been reliably entertaining. The characters are fun, the main story is suitably dramatic and the event stories are suitably comedic. The only thing stopping me from marking this game higher is a lack of an auto battle system for farming quests. Grinding through those quests is a grind, and a auto quest system would be benificial.",positive

It has the best story, the best agonizing gacha gambling experience, the best characters, the best boss fights, the best character leveling, and ok combat.

Game shuts down in middle of missions. Cleared cache and re-download several times.,positive
Some fun to be had. Especially if you equate spending money to having fun. The gatcha system is deplorable whereas compared to other games you need 10 of the specialized items you need 30 in this one. Each character has about a 100 items to upgrade in different systems it's just ridiculous. There is just really a little too much to upgrade to really have any fun in this. Seriously streamline the system for upgrading characters in their items. It wouldn't take away from the game.,positive

They are deleting negative reviews so I am reposting this. The app is buggy and unoptimized. Events are poorly explained and convoluted.

"This game however is focused more on servants & gameplay than the story. The main story was too long to follow, but however the character designs are from alright to pretty good. The downside to whoever plays this and Type-Moon fans is that THE GACHA RATES SUCK, INCLUDING THE LTD BANNERS. This game is like somebody's ex-girlfriend, but bit worse! Play the game and see what I mean. 1 year later update: it lags like heck some often, so please fix this.",positive
So the game itself can be fun amthr story is amazing. The biggest problem I have is the support and the mans system. Having a support as your mandatory 3rd servant gets rid of the fun and strategy of the turn making game for beginners. People who don't want to have another's servant can use their own servant they have that actually fits the team. Basically don't make support mandatory make it a reinforcement unit to come out when a servant passes away.,positive

Very good game if Merlin comes home ffs,negative
Fate Grand Order is always high on the top grossing games list and its clear why. This game has the most captivating and immersive story I've ever found in a mobile game. Regular events that reward the player with an incredible amount of upgrade materials for your units. Great gameplay involving tons of strategy and team planning.

Was really fun to start with. It's possible to get through the game as a f2p but a f2p player will have a worse experience if the gacha is not kind. Buying rolls are too expensive for the returns. Further down the line bosses start having gimmicks that rely on certain compositions. I play as a casual so these are not fun.,negative
"really good game. Love the servants, the graphics and much more about this game",positive
gud game,neutral
"Well, I'm a Fate Series fan so, this game would be a satisfaction to myself especially to further know the existence of Fate. First, well the gacha is like a hell and Quartz are limited only so you need to treasure your Sq. Even though I'm a f2p player, I'm enjoying it, even if its grinding. I hope you release more events, for specifically servants for free but needs hardwork to achieve. I'm Waiting for the free ticket for Allstar servants especially Castoria banner. I need Artoria in my life.",positive
"There's a good reason this gacha is so old by this point. It's got a deep gameplay, and the Gacha rolls may kill you but usually it works well enough. You also get a lot of free gems just by playing. But Arcade has Tiamat, so 2/10 mobile",positive
"Great game, I've played it since it's NA launch. The story is incomparable whether you're a Fate series fan or not and the community has unparalleled passion for each new development that absolutely is lived up to by the writing. Cons would be the exceptionally outdated grind and terrible rates/practices gacha-side, both aspects seeing slow, minimal improvement over the years. Nonetheless, I'd highly recommend this game to those seeking a truly grand narrative experience.",positive
The Curse Of The Cheating Curators Please Don't Not Download This Curse It Will Hunt You For Life,negative
main reason its four and not five stars is that increasing the bond level of the servants takes to long to make it useful i have jack the ripper from the reasent event and i have done about fifty missions with her in the party and only just today did i get to the second bond level so highly doubt i could get it to five before the event is done so yeah thats my main complaint other then that i love your game,positive

"Been playing this game for a long time. Game has an amazing story, especially in later parts. Gameplay is good, but if you keep using the same servants you will get bored. Most importantly, you will get disappointed. Rates is one thing, and there's no pity. Just spent about 500 Saint Quartz to not get even a single 5 star servant. If you are playing just for the story then you should definitely play this game. If you are aiming to get specific characters you better be ready to get disappointed.",positive

Let's be honest here. One of the main reasons why over a million people downloaded this app is because of Astolfo. If you remove Astolfo from this game I would not be surprised in the slightest if all of a sudden the player base is cut in half. He is after all the unofficial bi icon for a reason. The official reddit and discord for Astolfo most of the members who are bisexual is because of Astolfo.He's only sadly available via events but the ad was smart enough to use him.,positive
I have played this game since released and while it's a great game I'm rating this game 1 star because I am disappointed in the support service. After days emailing them and giving them proof they still would not give my account back. I dont know what happened with my email being changed and attached to my account I lost everything that I pulled. I am still upset after 3 to 4 years since I lost my phone. I'm still not happy. Because I did spend money amd show them proof and it's still not enough,negative
Love this game and love the anime series itself. After a couple years I came back to it and eventually obtained Altria Pendragon like I always wanted and fully ascended her. This game is fun and I enjoy the events that still come around. Hopefully hero summon events are more consistent in the future or just more averagely dropped. But definitely one of my favorite games of all time! üòÅ,positive

"I like the game and I think it's good,You may have to grind a little but it's okay nice graphics and it runs well on my phone even though it's low end,Pools for the gacha is bad I agree but it gives you the heroes you need for free which is nice since SSR is mostly for luxury you can breeze the game using what you have and not pay for stuff but it's your call",positive
"Love the game, fun to play, got me a nice servant rooster so far. Got erice and Voyager and a few other 4 stats and mordred as well. The only thing I dislike is the amount of storage it takes up compared to other mobile games, each scene taking up more and more data. Hopefully next game if they ever decide on it works around this problem. I understand why it happens, but it just painful for the phone when issues start to happen. Other then that its manageable.",positive
"I would rate this 3.5 it is good like in arts,design battle mechanics and the story and the sounds too but the biggest downpart is the no auto battle system like ive been playing for a while and still no update about implementing this like it would help me a lot since im busy at certain times so it would really help me manage my time but not its getting tiring like you need to be constantly playing so i hope someday it would get implemented i hope.

"Fgo before you download. Good story, good gameplay, learning curve around Camelot, rates are pretty bad but that makes you more excited when you finally pull a 5*, don't waste your money; welfare isn't abundant but you shouldn't spend money unless run out of free sq with story and side quests. You can reroll at the start for a free 4* maybe 5* if you're lucky. I suggest doing so. That's basically it, just remember it sometimes takes best boy to be best girl.",positive

"I've enjoyed the game quite a bit in my time playing it. In-game purchases are a bit expensive, but the resources that are purchaseable can be obtained through in-game means simply by playing.

Cons: very low drop rates on heroes, overpriced in game currency with no special offers or deals and my poor experience with customer service almost lost me my account. Overall: Great game! Especially for fans of the Fate series. 2022: Still going strong! Game is still great! Sadly, the cons haven't changed though.",positive

You're making a game that is hard to clear. Imagine the enemy's hp is 200k and after every turn it heals 2 million hp and my damage is only 150k for 3 max level heroes and I use their NP with full attack up buff. Now tell how can you clear that game? Maybe you should check it. It is so unfair. It is impossible to beat.,neutral
Rates are garbage compared to the majority of other gatcha games. Just used up all the SQ I have saved up over the past 2 years just to get absolutely nothing. Already was thinking of quitting the game before but this is the final nail in the coffin. Just save yourself some time and play anything else other than this outdated pile of trash.,positive

"The developers keeps deleting my review because of seeing a 1 star. What the heck guys? - False advertisement and event rewards for cash grab and bait. - Very, very low characters to get and what you get are terrible ones. - progress doesnt feel too accomplishing. - You need money to even get decent characters. - Game keeps lgging when entering or even confirming literally anything you do in the game.",neutral
"It's alright, truthfully. That said, as someone that mainly plays another game of a similar type known as Epic Seven, it feels like a step down to play Fate/GO. In comparison to Epic Seven, it dips in quality in most areas and is far more egregious with its greediness to the point where it feels a little oppressive to be honest. Its most redeeming qualities seem to be its story(for the most part) and the novelty of playing with your favorite characters from the series and from history.",positive

"The game has a good story and events. The content is generally good but it has the worst gacha system there is. The 5 star and 4 star rates on rate up are obviously inaccurate(much lower than what they show) there is no pity system, you can spend 1000+ quartz($500) on a banner and still not get the character you want. It's that bad. But if you just want to enjoy the story go ahead but just don't spend money on it. Trust me it's a waste, if you buy quartz use them as golden apples, it's better.",positive
"The game doesn't age well over years. Even the main story kinda fell off after season 1. Then the outdated gotcha system just stinks harder with years. Especially during pandemic, it's so depressing just to get craps from pulls as well as one can only exchange these craps to other craps. This game doesn't even have mercy to offer some decent exchangeable items. After all , when will we have a major system update?",negative

I came back into game. All of the memories are coming back to me of how hairyankingly annoying rerolling is.

Also, it can appeal to more than just fantasy RPG and anime fans as many of the characters have a basis in our world's history (albeit a fictionalized one), as well as providing potential waifus.",positive

It's a great game but you do eventually get burned hard. Happens to the best of us. Still it's a good game. Salty or not. The beginning translation needs work. The animations got updated but there's a few typos in Orleans still. Honestly it still holds interest many years later and continues to focus on story content. Minus one star for losing 1200 Saint quartz and 130 tickets to not get summer archer.,positive

"While it's a good game it's REALLY starting to show its age. With all the QoL and gameplay improvements over the years in the gacha game market FGO really needs to catch up. It's banner system, event style, rewards system, and grinding are all outdated. But despite all that it's an enjoyable experience even if you aren't a type moon fan. The characters are nice, the story is good, and it's updated frequently which is rare nowadays for old gacha games. Just hope the give us the pity system early.",positive
"This isn't a terrible game however the story is so incredibly and needlessly slow. Missions are extremely repetitive. Among the games out there that have a gacha system, I've never experienced one as sketchy as this one. Furthermore, similar to how other gacha games work, in order to be ""good"" you must get good servants. I've played on and off for about 5 years. I haven't paid a dime to the game and that's very apparent in my lack of good servants and rng. Wish drop rates were better.",positive

I had to edit my original review of 3/5 a couple of years ago.

Every New Year's they have a one-time promotion where for 15 paid saint quartz you're guaranteed a 5 star servant. I buy that every year, but it isn't expensive and it's a choice, you don't have to do it. I really recommend it",positive
"Whelp, just when i'm about to hit 300 log in days in a row, these new devs release an update that breaks the game. I'm on an emulator and when I open the game I can't load past the first screen. You know this really sucks, I only came back to this game after I stoped playing after my previous 200 day in a row log in only because DW were amazing devs that never gave a broken patch or had me worry about trash like this happning. New devs definitely aren't DW. F. Guess I'll wait 4 sf6 shoutout2ONO.",positive
A very fun game,positive
Came for the Waifu. Stayed for the story and characters. Overall a good experience.,positive
"Great game and its story, starting slow to interesting. And i do get what i wanted just by playing for free",positive
"Amazing game, storyline is topnotch AND NOT ur 'chosen hero' kinda stuff. Drop rates are terrible(sw lvl terrible) but at least they tell u it. Understand that rate up DOES NOT MEAN higher 5* rates; it only means that WHEN you get a 5*, that 5* has a higher chance of being the rate up one. This game has very good balance. A quick yt search would reveal ytubers like Green and Plushie who showcase lineups that can clear the hardest content in the game using lower rarities. High Investment Game!",positive
"As a fate fan, this game does it justice",positive
"The story and side missions/events are great! Made me really get into the fate series! I love the graphics too! Only annoying thing is summoning, but I've gotten enough servants through their events that it's fine.",positive
"Hey Devs, I been playing this game for some time now and I love it and respect you guys. So please help me because your app keep crushing when I open it. Please",positive
"The game overall is pretty good. The game itself is enjoyable. The servers are 2 years behind Japan's, but that's only because the game was originally intended for only being released there. The game is stable and it has a good plot to it. It can be pretty funny at times, overall really enjoyable. Some characters are completely obsolete, though. Rates are awful but you can still beat the game with only 1*-3s* and welfares.",positive

"It makes my phone heat up to an alarming temperature. Playing for 15 minutes, my phone gets hot enough to cause first degree burns.",positive
Forced tutorials and horrible draw rates as well as restrictions on the player on who you can and can't use because of a point system. Not worth the time to play.,negative
"Good for time-killing, if I can make a request, please create kotomine kirei that is playable",positive
"If you love waifus and a boring grind then this game is for you. I wish I could take back the money spent on this game, dropped about $200 total on this game trying to roll for my favorite character throughout my 3 years playing this game. The gacha is the worst than any gacha game ever, the grind is very long while the gameplay is mid which makes the grind a bit boring. I love the fate universe and all it's characters but just go watch the anime or play the extella games or even the VN.",positive
RRROOOOMMMMAAAA!!,neutral
"I had a good 3 year run with this game. Finally stopped playing because the farming got too repetitive for me but I did have a good time. The worst thing about this game is just like any other gacha, the rates for summons. I did get a majority of the servants I wanted. Had fun using all the characters but I felt it was my time to quit. Also there's a story, but I skipped that, wasn't invested in it Edit: I'm back, I can't help it",positive
"Great gameplay, great characters, and overall a great experience with the story and events. 5/5 would recommend to anyone.",positive
good gacha game,positive
Rarely experience crashes. The game works as expected. Gacha rates are kinda bad but maybe I'm just unlucky. I still got some 5 stars and some during rate ups so it's not all bad.,positive
Good game but the rate for some characters is way to low like a 5* rate for a 4*,positive
I love the game its really good high quality VA's story is nice I would recommend the game to update the ui its kind of outdated and pls add a download button or option on CE and servants grafitti,positive
Excellent game!,positive
"10/10 would not recommend. The gacha is fine(at least for me, i got several ssr with just tickets and im f2p), the game requires a lot of grinding, the story is great and some quests have intresting mechanics but after completing the story and events, the game gets boring(although the story is very long and events happen every month so you wont get bored easily).",positive
Fgo I've played for a while gacha can be fair if you have patience saving your saint Quartz for one you don't need every servant that has great assets or look cool just enjoy the story and play the game,positive
"A fantastic story with great characters. Some designs are way too fanservice-y for my taste, but nothing much I can do since it's a game made for horny bros. Has very simple gameplay and is a breath of fresh air among complicated new gachas nowadays.",positive
Not very f2p friendly,negative
"Been playing since the beginning. Nexon/Blue Archive could learn a lot from Aniplex about how to handle a gacha game, because this is perfection.",positive
"Very Good, Simpably characters *nose bleeds*",positive
This game is obsessed with forcing you to watch unskippable slow cutscenes and making you move super slow. The cards you get in this game are a joke. All 4 star and 3 star cards that do nothing and this game is a rip off of tales of link. Plus the special moves in this game are way too hard to get and the animation takes too long. Just a bad game in my eyes.,positive
Tried it spent over 1 hour and still had the tutorial going .....sad so sad,negative
U guys should add a auto feature other than that it's a good game ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,positive
"I have had this game for years and the disappointing thing is you can only access your data transfer from your previous phone. There should be more ways to access previous game play because phones die, etc. Why isn't information connected to my Google play account or via my email so a pin or password can be used to transfer the data? I don't even know if anything for the game is saved if I back up my phone on a hard drive. Plus, you can only use the transfer once from your previous device.",negative
Needs all that updates please update it really good and make it really cool make character looking into the dark fire Ninja and fire and water and ice and earth makeup fire nice and water and everything job and a night time and more update tonight with it If you send more free stuff to me thinking send me more diamonds and rings and money and it all hurting me,positive

Its beautiful. PS: Lasengle, please improve the pity system on this game or increase the rate on 5* instead of a .8% on their banner.",positive
sexy anime women,positive
"I have no idea how people like this game. The Fate franchise is the only thing carrying it. Not going to mention how bad the rates are. The gameplay is utter trash, its not an rpg. You attack with whatever servant that it tells you are allowed to. Every skill is on a super long cooldown. Enemies do not follow the rules, the MC is boring weakling who cant do anything. Mash is boring and one dimensional, no one had any personal motivations or goals. Story is regressive, you lose over and over.",negative
I loved the game ...before i had to change phones and lost all my progress and 5 star heroes.,positive
Okay but got a new phone and lost everything much rather they update it so you can login with play store or smth,positive

Impossible to reclaim my past master account. Do your fans a favor and allow them to link their accounts to their master profile so they don't lose all their data in case their phone messes up.,positive
Low pity rate,negative
Best turn based game in the world hands down!,positive
I honestly have a love/hate relationship with this game,positive
I like the game and story,positive
Too hard to play,positive
"Overall everything is great; the story, designs tho some can be too erotic but no problem, the servant lore, and the gacha if you want suffering towards gacha. The only problem are sprites and animation update since some servants kept their animations since the beginning of the game. Give them a makeover and more costumes. The content may be repititive to strengthen your servants but great.",positive
"The gameplay and story is ok(until you reach the lostbelts), but when it comes to summoning it's a bunch of bull.You get more craft essences than you get characters and it only gets you real angry when you do a multi-summon and get only 4 star craft essences and not a single 4 or 5 star charecter.",negative
"Amazing game, have put it down and come back a few times but this time around with the new 10+1 summon I've stayed quite longer. Although, since the latest update I've done 11 summons and I still have not received my 4 star card. Either I'm blind or something is wrong with the system",negative
"Could be a great game but you have to spend money if you want to enjoy the game or get even a close chance to maybe get the character you want, drop rates are almost impossible.",positive
"My rating comes by way of the game pretty much not having a way to save my progress after it tells me that uninstalling and redownloading won't delete my progress, but 2 times now that's been the case. It's frustrating to have to keep going through the learning process over again because the devs decide to do updates and the downloaded data that is put in to the game via patch update screws up my progress after clearing cache",positive

"Hello I'm new to this game. there's a problem when logging in, it keeps connecting even tho my net is strong",positive
"The combat is pretty straight forward and the art and graphics has only improved since i first downloaded this app. But there are severe downsides, for example, no autoplay you can't farm in game currency from doing the story, drop rates are abysmal even with supposed 4 star ssr drop rate ups for banners etc. Prices for the diamonds or w.e the currency is are so high too plus i don't understand how ive gotten more 4 star characters from summon tickets than multis. This game needs some real work.",negative

"What a ride of a game. Been playing since near the beginning of N/A's release. It's perfectly playable as a free to play game and most story arcs are worth reading. Newer players might become frustrated by the grind heavy nature of this game as they struggle to catch up to the current story, also rolling for new servants will also be an annoyance as the newer servants require materials not farmable until later in the story.",positive

Still needs a pity system and more opportunities for saint quartz,positive

"Love the game, no pvp BS is the way to go.",positive
Love the game played for 2 years now and love all the characters and event the game has the only thing that bothers me is that its a bit harder to get saint quartz,positive
My only main issue with the game is that grinding for upgrade materials is annoying. They don't drop as often as you would like. This makes leveling your servants skills and ranks a bit of a chore. Especially if you choose to be a free to play person like me (nor spend real money for ingame materials) The game is a bit more generous when it comes to quart crystals needed to summon 5 star servant than other gacha games. For new players do some quick research on which servant you want to roll for,positive
THANK YOU SO MUCH! üôè THIS GAME IS AMAZING!,positive

Pretty standard gacha game. Only good way to get high amounts of crystals quickly is through event login bonuses and that's not really good.,positive
After you updated again? I cannot open the game..even thru play store.,positive
"The main pull of the game is its story. It's brilliant! Great characters and world building with some excellent music to go along with it. However it's gacha rates are horrible so good luck trying to get the servant you want. Also the game play is a lot to be desired. It's not bad per se, but it's very lacking. I'm not good at describing the gameplay but if you look at some YouTube videos that will give a great idea on how the system works. So play for the story.",positive

For me it's chapter 4 when it gets interesting. Game play wise its not anything special but its the simple game play that makes it easy for me to do something else while playing.

The way entire events become unfinishable with one missed day is ridiculous.,negative
Great game I love everything about it but we need an event archive so that we can get older f2p servants instead of possibly never getting them. Also we need a speed up in content so we can not be so far behind jp. Because being two years behind is ridiculous. Even dokkan battle is only 6 months behind jp. But if you fix those issues this would be probably the greatest game on Google playstore,positive
It's so sad that this game is not available in my country but somehow I managed to download this game. The gameplay is pretty fun although is quite repetitive and bland and the gacha rate is a little bit annoying. As a f2p player It's unfortunate that I didn't get np5 for the certain characters I wanted even though I've saved my sq for them. Well looking at brighter side this game is still enjoyable even without spending money on it though you need to be patient.,positive

Love the game only thing that I wish that could change is that after completing a quest you get 2sq instead of 1 and reduce how much ce you get when you summon I sometimes get 3 units and the rest are old ce love to see that update then I'll go back to 5 stars,positive
"This game is merciless in the gacha. It is Free to Play friendly to a point (protip: do NOT hinge your enjoyment on obtaining a specific character because the odds are overwhelmingly against you), the gameplay is interesting and fun but quite grindy like most mobile RPGs.

"Imo it is one of the most expensive gacha games out on the market. In order to get the one unit you want, youll need to farm for at least half a year to get a decent chance at rolling. That isnt too bad, if you dont have many favorite units, but there are many good meta units that it would be a waste of time to pass up on in the long run. The gameplay isnt that great or fun but it can be challanging. The lore and the story is carried by its franchise which is its only saving grace.",positive

This game is such a cash grab. You need to spend at least 200 dollars to get the new unit. The events are pretty lackluster and it is just not worth spending money anymore.,positive
"Fan of the series but the gacha element is horrible. Did 4 ten pulls but not even 1 4 star or above servant just craft essence.Do note can the game can be cleared with the free servants but let us be honest, we want certain servants.",positive

love this game,positive
"Gacha rate is abyssal, gameplay is nothing special, music is not bad, but why do I rate this as 5* ? If anything this game is carried heavily by its storyline, characters are very interesting and their dynamic are well written.

Love everything in it except the gacha. Gacha sucks.,positive
Great game it has a good story and good combat mechanics although I feel it would be a bit better if it was a little more merciful to the player base in terms of summoning. Also most of the bosses have some gimmick where they have damage resistance that feels forced like they ran out of ideas it was fun when it first started but now it has lost its charm and just gets repetitive.,positive

"FGO is, despite its age, still a very good gacha game. It's story is easily one of its most engaging aspects along with the very enjoyable and diverse cast of characters based on historical myths and legends. However, it really does show its age as one of the earliest gacha games. No auto-farming, punishing players who don't log in by resetting the bonuses and an atrocious pity system leaves much to improve upon.",positive
Updated the game and lost all of my progress.,positive
It's still is my favorite game,positive
"Despite the difficulty in getting high rarity units, I was pleasantly surprised to know you can get through the game without needing them Getting a 5* mf is still very helpful and more likely than I imagined",positive
"The game is great. The art direction, plot, and ability to complete content with free characters or how while some characters are better, it's not impossible to use who you want. The only gripes I have are rates. It is rare to get a 5 star character. If you truly want one. It is wise to save and use the information we have from the Japanese version(further ahead by two years) to prepare.",positive
Just give me Ereshkigal and ill rate it 5 stars,negative
"This game in my opinion is probably the best gacha game on the market to me, and I feel what allows this game to do that is through its characters. In this game you can clear through almost all of the content without spending a single unit of the in game currency(more difficult but can be done) which makes it feel more like a choice to summon a character versus actually being forced to summon Characters to beat the game. This game also has some of the best storyline and art I have seen.",positive

"One of the best gacha games out right now. The gacha sucks, but there's no other gacha that has a more fleshed out universe and characters. (Don't bother reading the story pre-Camelot though) I've been playing for 5 years and I can say with confidence that there's almost 0 power creep. Every unit is relevant. This game focuses more on skills than stats so you better grind those lottos or you won't have the 151 mil you need to lvl up your 5* waifu.",positive

Game is eh Played this since 2017 nothing good changed in terms of gameplay except the breakbars concept. Community is filled with people that think they look cool because of their constant ssrs but they are just really inconsiderate of players who haven't been lucky since the game has no supporting system that eases the lives of F2Ps. Tfw the developers prioritized the delete account option rather updating the account bind system showing that a lot of players are quitting LMFAO,neutral
"It's Gacha nonsense so unless you love the series and are willing to spend money for A CHANCE to get good characters (seriously BS) don't bother. If you enjoy the series, like collecting characters, or have no end of money to waste by all means play it's a great game, outside of the gacha (which the devs joke about like it's okay SERIOUSLY BS FEATURE), I enjoy it.",positive

Well, I did quit last year Summer event but it was because it couldn't run on my phone and I didn't have time to use my pc often. The story is very engaging. Even though the gacha rates are low for SSRs, the game gives you good 1-3 star servants and the welfare 4* servants are some of the best in what they do, even compared to 5* ones. It has a lot of depth to the strategy and it's fun trying to come up with one.",positive

"Great game, story is beyond awesome! The drop rates seem a bit predatory I've hear it's like 1% to get a five star servant, good luck ever pulling and event servant. Good thing is you can get well into late game if not complete the story if you just beef up your 4 star and 3 star characters which they are vary generous with and. You get some pretty strong 3 stars by just playing the story. Game play can be a bit repetitive, but the story is so worth it.",positive

Worst Draw rate of any game. There are over 200+ characters and over 200+ CE cards. There should be no reason to draw the same card back to back then another type back to back in one 10 summon. So if you want a game your planning on getting slapped during summons then this game is for you. Just watch youtubers spending hundreds of dollars and getting ripped of on there summons should be enough to turn most off.,negative

"The story is 8/10 since it is hard to understand if you haven't watched fate anime. The animation is 10/10 since the animation is cool and it doesn't crash even when the internet is slow. The gameplay is 10/10 since you won't get stuck at certain levels since it is actually beatable, you just need to borrow other player's servant and of course you also need strategies. The summon system is 10/10 for me since I managed to get my first 5 star servant with summon tickets and the second with 90 SQ.",positive
"I've played this game since NA release. As a fan of the Fate series I love this game also it's my main game. Waifus game, grinding, turns system, NO auto farming, nice story, gacha hell (as every gacha game) but very enjoyable. The only thing I want the devs to improve in the game is the translation, like, seriously... it needs more love at least with the unit names.

"Great story and characters. The start is slow, and only starts to get good at ""Chapter 6"", but it's worth it. Must play if you're into the fate franchise. Game is very generous with the premium currency (SQ), but the downside is there is no pity system (there technically is but you'd have to be a whale to make us of it). Gameplay is fairly outdated. The game lacks support for more ""modern"" features such as wide aspect ratios and higher frame rates (locked at 30fps).",positive

"The game itself is pretty fun, though not fun enough for the gameplay to carry it alone. If you're not invested in the story to a relatively large degree at the 2nd singularity, you should probly drop it now instead of later. The reason I give it a 3 instead of something higher is because of how utterly hostile the gacha system is. The rate at which the gacha token item is acquired combined with the incredibly low rates for higher class servants means you shouldn't come for the gacha.",negative

Lots of grinding to max out servants but the game is humourous and quirky in a good way. I've always liked turn based games so I may be a bit biased but the balancing is good for the common characters and the 4/5 star characters feel powerful enough that you jump for joy when you get a new one. The game throws enough premium currency at you so long as you log in every day so the better characters are relatively easy to get. So long as your rng is good. 9/10 not bad.,positive
Awful gacha. Any game where having a whatever star character matters so much more than the gear and doesn't separate those items in draws is garbage. I've done 3 10 draws now and have not gotten a single character how can I progress without anyone of significant strength. Whatever idiot said these draws are fair should go sit outside and think about it real hard.,neutral

I played this several years ago but lost my account due to the single save code being a thing along with a patch that prevented me from opening the app on my laptop (where my save was).

Edit:I have see reviews and you don't respond to any of them it would be nice if an arena was added and if the gacha was balanced the best I got from 20 draws was three 3star servents fix this and learn to respond back and I will give you a 4 star at best,positive

Suffice to say I was a good whale for my time spent. Story and events are great, plenty of content spent there for many content updates. Spent being the keyword here. After forgetting to make a transfer number after I reinstall I now have no way back to my account. Spent all my time and effort and it's gone.",positive

"I've been playing since launch. Game is immensely fun and has plenty of hours of replayability to get all the materials you need. Can't really rate higher than 4 because it is a gacha game. Rates are obscenely low for 5* units and are too high for Craft Essences. Leveling some things is also completely absurd and takes way too long.

"It's a good game. Extremely dated. Quality of life stuff comes at a snails pace. Only recently got full screen. The grind is a nightmare unless you have reliable wave clears during lotto events which are kinda rare. The gacha is rancid too. Easily top 3. Which is coming from someone who luck sacked 6 kscopes in less than 2 months. This year. Avoid gacha. It's a death trap. The story is ultra compelling tho. You can tell their entire budget went into story, art and VA and nothing else.",negative

"This is a gacha game, so be careful about going into it. Anyway the main story is just fixing abnormalities in the timeline. There are tons of servants (characters) that you get to play as such as, Jack the Ripper, Leonardo Da Vinci, Astolfo, Achilles, and Jean D'Arc. It will probably be very confusing at first, but just bear with it as it does get a lot better. The game is still being supported with new events.",positive

Only modern gacha game without a safety net. Fight gimmicks get dumb in the later modern parts of the game that require specific setups that go into rocket science level study to pull off and the gacha pool gets more and more polluted with every update.

"The story telling is incredible, it has serious moments and silly moments. As for the game play, it's about strategy. You don't need 4 and 5 star's to move forward, planning is the key to moving forward during late game. 1,2, and 3 stars can still do wonders. As for the Gacha part, it's all about luck. It took me 2 years to get one Quetzalcoatl yet took me only a few days to get two Kingprotea. People who claim rate up is a lie are just bitter because they didn't get what they wanted.",positive
"The best gacha game ever, ever. Top tier writing and character design. Worthy of the illustrious anime to which it is related. Great rewards and gifts. Awesome, frequent, and satisfying events. Keeps improving steadily. Staff listens to fans input. Prestigious and original - many other games just try to be FGO. Genshin is garbage compared to this; it's from China, and based on exactly nothing so the characters and writing aren't even compelling. If you play Genshin stop and play this instead.",positive

Good game honestly. Been playing for about 2-3 years now but this past couple updates have been messing up my game. When on launch game runs fine for a while then all of a sudden it starts studdering and freezing in mid mission. I restarted my devices and issue still persists. Now im experiencing the game crashing along with the other issues. Never once experienced this before. Hopefully issue gets patched because it is irritating constantly having to close the game and restart.,positive
Honestly would enjoy it more if there wasn't a battle in every single story node with mobs stacked to the brim with hp. Also gacha rates are garbage for those who somehow never heard FGO's infamy. On the bright side they make good use of all the whale money with animes and stuff.,positive

"The main story picks up during Camelot/Babylonia, and the game does offer several events through out the year. Most of the art is good, some of the in game models are dated. Gameplay is decent, and can have depth. The gacha rolls are terrible and can feel worst if you are a f2p player. But most of the f2p 1* - 3* characters are useful throughout the whole game. Plus you can get fully upgraded welfare 4* characters during events. Because of this I think FGO can be more fair over other gachas.",positive

This is a very fun game if your into the fate series and is worth looking into for the story. But the gacha system is horrible with near zero percent chance to get something good and getting resources is EXTREMELY limited and time consuming. I would give this game a 5 star but resources and the percentage system is audacious. To the point where you have to buy saint quartz or spend everyday logging in and spend hours finishing extra quests to only collect 10-20 saint quartz.,positive

"Gacha is definitely on the low side; but the thing is you can clear all the content of the game with just the F2P servants; granted it will be very difficult especially if you dont olan and strategize ahead, but definitely possible.

So, I wouldn't recommend any new player to play. And if you really want to read the fantastic stories of FGO, go on youtube and read it there.",negative
"Well it's very addictive and the storyline is noicee. Be warned cuz it has really bad summoning rates but the lower rarity charas actually help when starting out (just a tip). Well hey, when u have E luck, u'll get used to it. I for one don't feel so salty anymore hehe :)) Edit: Heyy I finally got some 5*s after a long while yayyy",positive
Tons of content is freely available but the best experiences require supreme luck or money during summon pulls. The optimal strategies you can implement in the game will require certain characters that you'll most likely not have. Events happen every few weeks which keeps things fresh. The game's base plot can be boring but there's certain campaigns (singularities) which are a lot more compelling than the initial stages. Overall great game for long term investment. Expensive if not f2p,positive
"Very well-written story and interesting characters well worth the price of GACHA. Do not forget to regularly use the ""Clear Cache"" button on the title screen, or the game's data will swell to overtake your phone's entire storage from unused update files as Events are released and locked away.",positive

I love this game I've only been playing for abt 2 weeks and i already have most of my favourite characters. And I also got a SSR/5 star servant. With only 2 weeks I already got a SSR/5 star servant which is Hijikata toshizo the vice chief of shinsengumi (weird seeing him like this since ik his character from gintama) this is overall an amazing game and highly recommend it.,positive
It's Good,positive
A game aimed for fans of the Fate series. I like the art in this game it's not always consistent but all the characters are unique in thier own way. The story starts slow at first but ramps up til the end with an epic climax in the Final Singularity and gets better in the 2nd Lost Belt Arc. All characters except welfares have 4 portrait arts and 3 battle sprites which is also a nice touch. A must play for players who enjoy story and lore in RPGs.,positive

Okay ill have to change my review. After restarting after some time playing for idk how long now. I realized that through how long term this game has been. It hasn't been updating itself to be more player friendly. Gacha rates are sort of worse. Similar to other games where there is more other stuff than units...where the rates to get the units is worse. If you are f2p...ignore this game. Don't try it. And avoid it. Ill save you the trouble and ask that u play other games.,negative

"The story and gameplay is entertaining and enjoyable. The characters are well written. As a fan of the Fate series I recommend this game. But the gacha rates are abysmal there are so many craft essences and characters in the pool that your chances of pulling a high level character is near nonexistent and also the rate up is a lie, so if you plan on starting a collection of fate characters turn around and run because you're more likely to get the same 15 characters over and over again.",positive

Character designs are great as expected, voices for characters are phenomenal, and the number of things one could do besides battling are okay. The gacha system does make it difficult to obtain good characters but in the end it's a gacha. In all, a well made game, and enticing for those familiar to fate series. 4/5.",positive

"This is one of my favorite games. The gacha rates aren't as bad as people make it seem, and the developers are very generous with free in game currency/characters. The story is frankly amazing. And while the gameplay isn't the peak of mechanical experience, it is a fun and entertaining game. The devs give a damn, a novelty among gacha games these days. Plus all content is doable F2P. I'd recommend it to people honestly.",positive
"Much more grindy than i believed, log in bonuses dwindle to basically nothing after 4 weeks. Alot of the events are inaccesable to new or newer players which is mildly infuriating. It just feel like a cash grab game based of a really good show and theyre taking full advantage. Very grindy, more some than other games like this. In game purchases are also very expensive, don't get me wrong it a good game but you're going nowhere fast.",positive

This is a gacha game with abysmal (Even for gacha games) low rates... And absolutely NO PITY SYSTEM. Yeap. No Pity System at all. You're never guaranteed anything. Also eventually all servants skills and abilities become very repetitive...",negative
Its nice,positive
"The game is good, has good story, fun characters, 5* worthy... but too many faults. Lack of more than 1 rerun for events so new fans miss out, hard pulls and low percent with no pity summon, feels like some battles are forced just to add filler. Maybe save up 600+ gems for 1 or 2 waifus or husbandos, because even for one 4 star 300 might not even be enough. It's not new player friendly, many faults, but I still would recommend giving it a try if you plan on being in it for the story only.",negative

Gameplay is kinda boring tbh and this game is seriously not forgiving about summons. It takes forever just to save up enough gems for a multi summon. Character designs and story are good but just doesn't make up for boring gameplay and awful summoning rates. If you want to get anywhere far in this game you either have to fork over your paychecks or waste hundreds of hours grinding. It's the definition of gacha hell. Not worth it,negative
Pretty fun but i have 2 major updates.The gacha rates are terrible. And the ui looks outdated,negative
"Progression-wise it does take a while to actually get anywhere but take it little by little and you get where you want to be eventually. My only real wish is for the Player to be customizable (SKIN TONES, hairstyle, etc.) Mystic Codes do not count). I feel like it's only fair since the Servants originate from various cultures and also have different forms. Many other mobile games have striven to be inclusive w/ their player characters and FGO has no reason not to follow suit.",positive
"Bit dated, too many fodder characters and Essences. Lost an account with semi-decent rolls, Support NP system was not explained correctly. Enjoyable story and character designs, horrible rates...

"Beta phase bugs and freezing, decent gatcha rates, story feels like 'Bill and Ted's excellent RPG"".. which isn't really good or bad lol....the only reason it gets 3 stars is because of the battle system.

"Great game, love the Fate franchise, and a ton of characters who are likeable. It's a bit of a play 2 win model in which I spent thousands of dollars since it first released.

I'll continue playing till this game dies, but I probably won't throw money at it like I use to.",positive

Best game ever ! Great story and I really love the soundtracks as well. However the gacha kinda sucks. Spent 300 quartz and didnt get a 5 star :(,positive
this is one of the best gachas ive everd played. But the fact that you can spend like 200$ and not get the unit you want hurts. You save for month's just to get one or two units you want and not get them is bad. This game badly needs a good pity system and not what it has now.,negative

I mean, I spent around 30 dollars hoping to get a good servant and I didn't, But then a few weeks later I've got 3, 5 star servants, 2 of which were from summon tickets. So, it's not PTW. Just don't expect to get any specific servants.",positive

Gacha: mostly 3‚≠ê, some times 4‚≠ê and if will extremely lucky (less 0,01% and 0,1% on events) 5‚≠ê characters. by this cause F2P not friendly: later game bosses has alot hp and dmg amount, so even with p2w players support characters, stage often failed.",positive

Fate is always hit or miss. Sometimes you get a new character in one roll. Other times it takes well over 200. It's so random that it's honestly maddening. The story is good and the characters are nice. Wouldn't reccomend though. 10/10,positive

I'm going to be honest the main thing holding this back is grinding and I can't lie about that it's always awful grinding in this game you have to spend multiple days grinding yet in order to get materials to get ready for the next thing and then you have to get thing and but that doesn't matter it's a good game it's really really good game if you care about the story and the characters of which case this would be leagues higher any another mobile game comes to story but still doesn't mean that,positive

Low rates arent favorable, but thats how the game rolls. Its a grind, new players be ready.

"The best gacha for me despite its abysmal gacha rates. The reason for it is not only because of how well the stories and characters are written to the point you'll feel attached but also because FGO is actually ""f2p-friendly"". You don't need SSR characters to complete the contents (no pvp and you can also borrow other players' servants). All characters, even the two to four stars ones, have useful kits. Grinding is hell coz no auto but worth it because of generous rewards (e.g. lottery event).",positive

Hmm.... It is an OK game.Combat is Kinda outdated at this point tbh. Also the Gotcha rate can drive you nutso.,positive
"Been playing this game almost 3 years on the NA server and its been a amazing experience, the story is very good and the gameplay is good. The gacha is easily one of the games problems, rates for 5 stars are pretty bad and the pitty system is pretty much nonexistent even for whales but they have buffed the rates over time. There's also tones of great waifu's/husbando's with really good voice acting, even with my fair share of bad luck in the gacha I still highly recommend anyone to play this.",positive

So yeah, I'll give this a 4 star because my gacha rolls were good. I would've given a 5 but I blew 150 SQ for Jeane alter and got Tristan instead. No tsundere for me. But the story is something I greatly enjoyed. Even when I started with no amazing sr and ssr servant, I still enjoyed the story of saving human history.

"As a visual novel, FGO is fantastic, with a story that starts off decent and has only grown in quality over the years. As a game, a lot of its mechanics are really starting to show their age. As a gacha... there's no safety net, and you have about .5% chance of getting an SSR servant, so keep that in mind before you roll or spend in general. I still play, mostly because I've been here since EN launch and am super invested, but I really would advise any new players to moderate their expectations",positive

"Honest review from some who has been playing for 4yrs, f2p and a fate franchise fan. It removes normal fate anime mentality of kill or be killed and brings out the wholesome and the true personality behind the characters. I must say the prices for sq are a bit pricey but given players many chances to gain sq therefore I can remain f2p. I have grown a little attached to the characters through the fantastic plot and with the updated np animation, I stop complaining about where the skip button is.",positive
"I love this game. It hurts me on an emotional level. The story is amazing, and the events are even better. It's just the same thing... over and over. The characters are likable. Why?

Phenomenal story but starts out slow. Gacha is debatable since NA can see future banners and lucky bags are a thing. Friend support system is great. Only downside is farming since it's the majority of the game. Give this game a try if you like fate or want to walk yourself into hell.,positive
I have nothing to say but I'm giving it a 5 star rate,positive
Both the stories and characters are amazing! This is my favorite game so far.,positive
"This game has the most detailed story and extended story I've ever played. Fate has a special place in my heart after the visual novels, however the only issue with the game is the rates for servants. One day you could spend everything and get nothing or you could just use 5 tickets and get a good SSR. Other then that and the small amount of stamina, the game is great.",positive
5* aren't guaranteed but the story is really great and there are other units you can use.,positive
I love the doujin's made by different mangaka of fgo,positive
Well the reputation for low SSR rate is expected as I heard from my peers but those event exclusive characters and the events are reasonable (example last summer event gave tremendous XP that I levelled up thrice than normal even with only One SSR out of three at full level). The reason I'm giving this high rate is their assistance when I almost lost my account. I managed to recover it within a week and gave advice too (and I finally got my waifu in an unexpected day).,positive
One of the best game of the gacha The story is such Masterpiece of Masterpiece But the gameplay will not please to someone because some of these fools think 3d >> 2D Anyway The character design are soo beautiful The fandoms are nice or wholesome than genshit impact 10/10 stars or 5/5 stars Would not reccomend to anyone if you have gambling addict and terrible mental illness,positive

Good story, enjoyable events, gacha rate is good despite still getting CEs most of the time but getting surprise pulls and almost getting 5 stars for each class. Farming part might be tedious and the NP skip and no auto farm but at least the rewards are worth it. Game wise. I will keep on playing.",positive
"This is the first I liked and loved a gacha game. I always ignored gacha games before because of various reasons (boring plot, too many buttons, auto farms, pay to win, etc.). I loved this game it is balanced and easy to understand mechanics. It also has unique story unlike other games.",positive

I also find it very f2p friendly (my personal experience). Generous with currency (saint quartz) if you put in the time. New content is frequent but not overwhelming.

Since starting, I have never missed a single event, let alone a single login on both accounts. I'm in love with the story, gameplay, and characters. Coming from a person who has been playing Azur Lane since launch, a mostly auto farming game, I really enjoy the active gameplay needed to play this game.",positive
Great game love the story,positive
"The game has terrible rates and it can be difficult, but many boss fights can be exploited and supports let free to play players try strategies that would never work otherwise. Many low rarity units are solid and can beat most content and when you do eventually get high rarity units, many are perfectly serviceable at one copy, along with free units that come with most events. All in all, this game has a great story and it's perfectly possible to only want units you love.",positive
"I think its very fun. You are never truly out of options as the welfares are generally at least good if not outright amazing. While the low rates can put a hamper on the experience, I feel like anyone who is a Type Moon fan[not only Fate] can enjoy FGO's story, as its story is easily the most amazing part of the game. While they are getting more generous as the month go by and we catch up to JP, I do hope they eventually see the value a spark system adds to whales and F2Ps.",positive
"I played this game since 2015, both EN and JP versions and it has gotten very stale for me. No spark/pity system in 2021 is very disheartening. Not to mention the lack of regard for long-time players and additions to their older servants. I loved the time I had with it, but I feel that it's at the end of its lifespan... Only spend that $15-20 on the yearly guaranteed *5 banners and your pain will be severely mitigated when servers tank one day. Also, NO AUTO PLAY???? ü§Æü§è",negative

The gameplay also turns into a cycle of unrelenting tedium, where you use the same skills and NPs almost hundreds of times to finish the events.

Simple turn base gameplay and very nice character design. There after some character that are a bit too revealing but overall, I love the game and story...",positive
"One of the longest running Gacha RPGs, this F2P has an amazing story, events every month, free rewards, and Servants and more. It is recommended that you have a good amount of free time, and are willing to grind for resources. Online guides will be a great help, because there are many menus and activities that aren't fully explained. Beware this game for its Brutal chance systems, for both low item drops and extremely rare 5* Servants. Don't spend too much money, you might not get anything.",positive
"I've been playing this game for about 3 and 1/2 years now, and I have no real complaints. As a fan of the Fate series this obviously gives me my fix, the system itself is very easy to learn, somewhat difficult to master. Depending on a gacha system can be frustrating, especially whenever you can't ever seem to get the servants you want. But you can always use your friend supports and still experience that service until you can get them for yourself.",positive

"Gameplay is fine and the gacha rates are depressing, no pity and abysmal chances. But the free to play characters you can get are good enough to the point that getting 5 stars are more of a luxury rather than a necessity, still they of course make getting through the game much easier and friends are easy to get. The playerbase is pretty nice so you can friend people with many good and built 5 stars are easy. If you blow money and still don't get the character you want, you shouldn't be surprised. The story and lore is what is the main highlight of the game. To play this game is to sell your soul.",positive

Just be sure to experience every other Fate entry before starting this.",positive

"This game is fun overall. But I only have a few complaints. 1. The gacha is absolute trash. A .8% drop rate for 5star servants with no pity system apart from USO (Unregistered saint Origins.) Which only rewards the whales, is kinda ridiculous. 2. Ever since the more recent updates which increased the game speed, I had to deal with more screen freezes than I can count. 3. Ever since Gilgamesh got his animation update. The game runs at a snails pace every time I attack with him. Except for his NP.",negative

Boring game play sucks your soul out by having to grind nonstop events with no speed up or auto battle for missions already completed 50 times. If they didn't make you spam the same mission 100+ times to get imaginary points that do nothing I would give 3 stars. But I shall forever bench my 3000 dollars spent characters on the game becuz the publisher doesn't care about it's player base.,negative

The gameplay is outdated and boring. There is a lot of grind and it's tedious with no skip/auto play. The gacha is absolutely atrocious with no pity and chance to not even get the unit you want. The saving grace of this game is it's amazing story and how f2p friendly it is. If you only care about story and the fate franchise it's pretty good. Otherwise I can't recommend the game.,positive
"The game is good and all but could we perhaps get a pity summon? I've been summoning like atleast 20 times and still haven't gotten a five star, other than that the game is good in my opinion",positive

"Stellar story and characters. If you're a Fate fan, I highly recommend you to try this game. While its gacha rate is abyssmal, its collections of waifus more than makes up for it. I like how low-maintenance this game is as in you can log in once for the daily reward and call it a day! It lacks competitive gameplay, allowing me to enjoy the game without that pressure. The only downside of this game is that its graphics and gameplay are outdated by today's standards.",positive

Also, pls at least make a more safe account bind, I have a friend who got 18 SSRs for an F2P player and the devs can't do anything for him because of being F2P.

Honestly the gameplay is outdated I only play because my friends play it. If you dont hate yourself avoid this game at all cost. The gacha is really predatory and punishing.,positive
"The gameplay is entertaining though the farming is excessive, but as a waifu and husbando collector all else pale. I've never seen another Gacha put this much story and personality in their characters. Of course that is because this is from the Fate series and has extensive mangas and animes to draw from, but you don't have to have seen anything from the Fate series before to enjoy it. If anything, maybe playing FGO will make you want to watch the series later.",positive
"The fate series.. the most complicated series ever! Game is great for fans but not so great for the wallet. The chances of getting 5 star units is slim to no chance. The game wants you to spend thousands just for a chance at something good. The worst part is that all your progress isnt saved into an account or anything so if your device breaks, say goodbye to the progress youve made and units you've collected. Plz for the love of god add a feature to save our progress in case our device breaks!!",positive

Yeah, I have a lot of 5* servants, but I can still complain about the static 1% chance of getting a 5* servant. If the game had a pity system, this would have been a 5/5.",negative
"The game is a ton of fun, but it is not without it's problems. Major Pros: -All the characters to choose from and a easy to learn leveling system makes it fun to get new characters and level them up. -The combat is very fun and simple.

Most cutscenes run at least a few minutes, if not up to 10 minutes. -The long grind to get characters to their max.",positive

"This is a very great game. I was very happy about this app because I loved fate zero. However, this game is not without its flaws and shows its old age like an IPhone, the gameplay depth is lacking comparing to other competitors, the content outside of main story and events are non-existent (for me, in between events would be a period of hiatus because there is nothing for me to do), and the HUD bring me back a lot of memories because it reminds me of the windows XP days.",positive

FGO has a classic kind of RPG battle system, which I love. The game is easy to understand as well as the UI layout. The story is also engaging. The characters are all unique in their own ways. I love the artwork, the seiyuus, the songs, everything. But I will admit FGO is Gacha Hell. Edit: Still, I will never abandon FGO for as long as I live.",positive
Game is great if you are a fan of the franchise The rates are abysmal and there is no pity pull... Play at your own risk. The gacha system needs a revamp. Pity system should be added.

Suuuuuch a grindy game. If you dont have time to grind dont download. Its alot of fun and there are alot of cool elements but the only thing i really despise is the in game purchases.

PLEASE MAKE THE RATES HIGHER!!! Besides that the game is very enjoyable",positive

I do recommend people with obsessive collecting tendencies or spending/gambling issues dont play, cause the gache system will get to you.

I know a lot of people are complaining about the gacha rates but ive found that you can get better gachas by lvling I gacha 1 time out of every gacha event and ive gotten 3 5* in 1 gacha this was after i had almost maxed out everyone else The trick is to make sure each character you have is at least at stage 3 ascension and yes i also mean the 2*and 3* Absolutely all of them; the more ascensions you have the higher gacha rate you get; ive gotten almost every single 5* this way.,positive

I have played Fate going on 3 years now and have poured more money into this game than I'd like to admit but with the release of so many new gacha games it's hard to recommend this. The gacha system can be brutal compared to the likes of other gacha games that are arguably more fun and more free to play friendly. The gameplay system is fun at times in the more challenging content but ultimately it gets super repetitive when grinding out events or doing dailys i.e. no autoplay options........,positive

What's more is that older players can only get 6SQ per week without events. UI isnt optimized for newer devices, farming is laborious and still no NP skip. But Waifus are top tier, writing is great and if you have loads of time then this game is quite the time killer.",positive

Best story out of a mobile game I've ever played,positive
"I absolutely love this IP but this gacha is outdated. Card arts are beautiful and the story is great, but you can admire that on Google/YouTube. I actually don't mind the gameplay but the gacha is brutal. No gacha game should make you have to not pull for a year to get a unit you want in the future ,and there isn't even a pity. Point of a gacha game is to rng pull, instead you build anxiety over months hoping you get x unit",positive
crippling gacha addiction,neutral
"Bad gacha rates, that all I wanted to say. I rather invest more on other game like hi3 or genshin compared to this, at least they provided soft pity gacha system to player and also better gameplay. Although the gameplay and storyline are nice but still I will not recommend this game to other player since this game is kinda waste of money and time.",negative
"Overall the game is fine. I really only play to interact with my favorite characters. None of which I have. My biggest gripe is the gache system. Most gache games have one of three styles. 1. Low summoning materials, but high summon rates. 2. Lots of summoning material, but low summon rates. 3. Somewhere in between. However, this game incorporates the worst parts. Hard to get summon currency and terribly low rates. It also has a horrible paid part. The quartz or whatever are way overpriced.",negative

"If you have watched and liked any Fate series, you will love this game. The game allows you to summon some of the cool characters/servants you see on the TV, and each of them has different skills and capabilities. However this is a gotcha game and the number of good powerful servants you can get is reliance to your luck and your wealth. Recently, this game gives me an connection issue and I could not connect to the game unless I switched to mobile data",positive
"I've been playing this game for 3 years, and I love it. The story is mind-blowingly good (as expected of Type-Moon!), the characters are all unique and interesting, and the gameplay is fun. The gacha is pretty brutal (no pity) but you don't even need a single 5* in order to clear the hardest content ingame, because the free/low-rarity units are absolutely amazing. It can get pretty grindy (ESPECIALLY if you have a lot of SSRs!), but I'd take that over the game being p2w . 100/10",positive
Still no account system!?,negative
How dose this game do so well the drop rates are utter trash it takes forever to grind up star quartz I love fate but this is monatizing at its best you have to be a whale to enjoy this game cause theres no pity system at all in this its sad to see one of my favorite anime series drop this low beginers beware its a trap,positive

The game is great. Although theres a chance that it loses your account when you havent making an account. Then uninstall it. I know im an idiot but is there you can do about it?,positive
"The Quintessential Gacha(tm) experience. A (sometimes) good story that will force you through: grinding hell from which their is no escape, an upgrade system that gets more complicated each passing year, and abysmal summoning rates that makes throwing your money into a pit of fire look like a better financial decision in comparison. However, the girls are cute. Overall 10/10 I will be be liquidating my assets for Ishtars next summon banner wish me luck mates I dont even like Fate all that much",positive
Game used to be fun. Now it's not.,positive
"Amazing story, VA, and animations. More Rank ups and side story stuff like the interludes would be nice. would be amazing if re:lights and older events, Along with event banners made come backs between waiting period months for veteran players. New players would probably buy more for SQ if taxes didn't jump up. But bringing back older events and their banners might help. For replaying events instead of SQ and Lore it could be Mana prisms/Origin. Or respectively MP/rare Prism.",positive
"Overall, the game has great graphics and the events keep you very entertained. The only issue that i have with this game that it doesnt have a link to save your progress like a google linking system or icloud system.",positive

Fun and enjoyable,positive
"It's a great game, the gacha is a nightmare cause there is no guarantee but the game is fun nonetheless and you can progress with just 1-3* servant. It's just really unfortunate that a lot of materials for servants are dropped from story locked higher levels, moreover a lot of free materials that'd greatly help with ascending your servants, are on events that are locked for players who hasn't finished the main story arc, and believe me ‚Äî it's hard, especially if your servants are underleveled.",positive

My latest account I had spent at least 300$ on, and because my phone died, I lost all of it, and they won't reply to my emails trying to recover it. Why the hell anyone would spend money on a game with such poor backup mechanics and lousy customer service is beyond me. I would not reccomend this game to anyone.",negative

"If you don't want to pay money and you don't care about the story I suggest a different gacha game. The rates are absolutely abysmal there are many people that have spent thousands of dollars on this game just to get characters they want. It took me about 3-4 hours just to pass the first singularity, to unlock all the basic menu stuff that most games will give you in like 3 levels.",positive
great game and i glad you guys brang this to chromebook too,positive
Great game totally ruined my life,positive
"Normally I don't rate games as if I'm happy or not really interested, I'll just continue to play or remove the game. I really do like FGO, it's story, the characters, especially the events in the time I've played since November 2018, but customer support has been less than ideal as I provided the needed info and also showed pics of receipts from quartz I've bought in trying to get my account back, but nothing worked. I'd say it's a 5 but CS is just not that helpful.",positive

"Aside from the gacha this game is so fun The events are rewarding,the story is pristine,the characters and just everything is just beautiful,it feels so nostalgic like from a time that is so familiar yet you can't remember. Now to the gacha it's not that bad. In gacha games the real enemy is not the gacha but your mind itself. You will constantly feel that you need this CE or servant to do this quest or just in general like the servant but because of gacha you can't get it.",positive

I been playing this for 2 month now and I love it but pls gave me a artoria Pendragon lancer I'm crying but. must play this game take out your stress or to pass the time just relax and play it,positive
Good game BUT IMPLEMENT AN ACCOUNT SAVER LIKE GOOGLE PLAY OT SOMETHING Its stupid to have to save this code onto your phone for it to be transfered ONCE so now thanks to that I just lost my entire account which to get the 5 star event characters wasnt so easy,positive
I hope u guys fix it. Cause I love the anime.,positive
"Awesome, i would honestly love it if you guys developed a MOBA style game with the servants. I feel like it would play off very well. Idk though.",positive
"It has a great story absolutely, and while the gameplay itself is basic, it still fun because the animations are generally very satisfying. My greatest problem however, are the low rates for rare servants coupled with no pity system, you can really be left hopeless, so be VERY careful how you spend your money. I really wish i could give this a 5 star, but that gatcha really is hell sometimes.",negative

The game is great but it has one major flaw and that is the summoning/gacha system fgo has some of the lowest drop rates in any gacha game I've ever played fgo is one of the most predatory gacha games do to its really horrible summoning drop rates and some of the events are terrible the event I really hate is the servant fest event that event is one of my least favorite events in the game.,negative

Amazing game for those who love nasuverse or typemoon stuff. Amazing story. Hope it continues for years.,positive
Love the game but that's from a fan of the fate series bias. Gameplay is a bit dated doesn't mean it's not fun for those into that. Story picks up after chapter 4 and for the most part gets better and better with each new chapter. If the game had better pity system and improved rates I would give it a higher score. FGO is more for the fans in my opinion so harder to recommend.,positive
Not what I was looking for,neutral
This is trash Jk I just told my self that I'll rate this one star if I didnt get a 5 star servant but I like this game dont get me wrong,positive
"One of the video games with the best story that I have played, the details and character development can also be seen. The gameplay is also great, all of the characters has their own uses; despite the servant's rarity, all of them can be used even in a late game progress. The Noble Phantasm animation are good. The game requires time and dedication in order for you to reach and play most of the content. Extremely F2P. The only cons I know is the rate of the gacha, the rate up is a lie. Sometimes.",positive

"Some events are unaccessible unless you complete/reach certain chapters making it likely to permanetly miss contents. The drop rate are ridiculously and suspiciously low, even on rate up banners. Time consuming farming due to Lack of auto battle for completed missions. Lack of a real Pity system that's not exclusive to mega whales. Still i Love the story, soundtrack looks and characters. Though there's many problems that are quite anti-consumers, so far, i can't really let go despite that.",negative
"After playing plenty of gacha games this is still the one that I find has the some of the best gameplay, which is both simple and immersive. However, the Emiya Alter censorship still rubs me the wrong way and I really can't recommend FGO to anyone unless you have enough self control to F2P, or you can suffer through the gacha without breaking the bank. If you're a Fate simp, this is definitely a game for you.",negative

"This game is actually very awesome if you watch the anime it's kinda rushing it but I like it,it goes through every detail on the anime and it's pretty good but I have a complain cuz as you can see it's online but on merely the hole game is offline except on the support character choice thingy and the summon cuz we gamers can handle it we just play online when our gems (I forgot what was it called while writing this) that can use for summon is up so thats just it hope this review doesn't ignored",positive

"this game is good, tho this is a gacha they still give awesome rewards and some summoning accessible to casual players. but still can't complete some events cuz it's hard to grind and lvl up without using money.",positive
If your lucky than its fine but if not don't even bother you can spend 500+ and get nothing.,neutral
"I cant open all the versions, I mean all of it. My wifi is good it's not slow, I even do speed test couple of times, play a game, download a game to check the signal itself yet why I can't play this?

"Been playing for almost 2 years, everything is top notch from the characters, story and events, literally everything you'd want in a gacha game is in here, except the rates... I'm mostly fp2, I only spend money gssrs (basically a guaranteed ssr banner and is only summonable with paid currency) and I'm doing really good and having fun. TLDR: it's a really good game but don't expect to a lot of good units from the start, just try to save your quartz for the units you REALLY want and have fun!",positive
Horrible rates and the game is really slow,negative

"I Love the game, I just wish rates were better on it. I did a saint draw ten times and only managed to get one 4 star hero. You should seperate the cards from the heroic spirits.",positive
"Good at the start but i losed all my motivation playing the game after spending 300dia at the gacha. Please raise a bit the drop rate % i keep getting 3‚òÜ and it's make me want to break some tables ""I really like the game just do something about the % and i will shut up nyahah""",positive

Just the fairy knight gawain that is all.,neutral
"The game itself is fun, the graphics are great and the story line is quite a challenge. I personally think the hardest thing about this game is the character drop rate, it's so low you could be waiting several months just to get a 5 star charcter.",positive
Hi yes been playing this game for a while it's great got the characters I wanted but I ran into a issue on opening the app all I'm getting is a black screen just that I tried all of the methods to fix and they haven't work,positive

Decent time if your fate fan little bit grindy but you'll get what you need to out of it over time,positive
"Fun game, decent amount of strategy involved. Lots of character variety, great art style and animation. Prices are a little steep on the currency though, so buy responsibly.",positive
Accidentally deleted the game and lost my account FOREVER. The game is still played by many players today but backing up information by binding the game account to an email is still not implemented. You try contacting the support to ask for other ways to help in retrieving the account but the support just sends templated replies and doesn't even show an ounce of sympathy with the player.,positive
App goes down all the time and constantly says wrong version but there's no update available.,negative
The game is good it's just that the glitches and slowness is annoying.,positive
I love it especially 1rst hassan and altria alter (saber),positive
Good story and gameplay but man the grinding is too much please add some way to make grinding easy with some form of skip ticket take princess connect and their skip ticket system,positive

I love going through the storyline and seeing seeing all the different battles and cuts scenes but I'm it is but I'm more like summoning the character being the character that I can battle with and forming a bond with and forming a bond with them because some of them are really cute,positive
"I find the gameplay, story, and character interactions enjoyable; my only gripe with the game would be how insanely difficult it it is to pull some of the higher rarity characters, but this is a gacha game so I guess that's to be expected",positive
Fate / Grand Order is a game based on the anime series that pits an organization called chaldea against alternate realities that they must alter in order to save the world. The game has a remarkable story and a well presented art. But what is a game without its amazing characters and history. In FATE / GRAND ORDER the characters follow real and mythical heroes from our reality with a twist for charismatic and a bit of spice. The game is very well made and is addictive. It also features GATCHA.,positive
Really fun and love the characters,positive

"It is a fun game. Though sometimes the screen ""sticks* sometimes even the internet is working fine here.",positive
"Pretty great game, story, characters, and gameplay. The only drawback is how rare 5 stars are. 0.12% in many cases, kinda absurd in my opinion.",positive
Can u kindly increase servant rates? :(,positive
As a Avid FAN of the Fate Series! This is a must game to have!,positive
"This is a great game to all Gacha players out there, but always remember. Once you are in, you are in.",positive
Thank you so much my concern regarding account transfer has been resolved quickly! I get to play again and picked up where I left off.,positive

Gameplay is simple but that's fine since the story is on a whole different level. Playing this feels like I'm watching an Anime. Been enjoying it so far despite being a Free 2 Play player,positive
Somehow still playing it,positive
"This game lies about event timing, wastes your time and steals your money. Could be a lot better for how popular it is. They really need to borrow some ideas from Epic Seven. Particularly the animated character art and Lobby/menu screen, guaranteed summon, etc. Also, Drop Rate Up is a lie.",negative
Would be nice if i can use my Google or fb as a log in method cause i lost my acc couldn't get back,positive
Such amazing game you deserved my 5 stars,positive
This is rather expensive game for the 2021 If you want to be collector prepare to pay at least 300+ USD every event. 2 event a month to grt SSR. I only play because i love the fate universe,positive
I've played this far longer than I should have I think,positive
"All in all this is a very good game, excellent in fact. There's lots of combination to use, rosters to form and so far, the events are godly (free stuffs everywhere) so yeah I'll keep playing the game, thank you.",positive
I've never given the fate series much thought before I played this game. I'm such a huge fan of the series now. I've been playing this game since a few months after it was released. I fell in love with the story and the characters. I can't wait for what the future holds for this game!!,positive
Lot of fun on playing the game,positive

this game is literal hell,negative
"Overall it's good for what it is, but I can't help but feel that there should be more lower tier sabers so that the class is actually available to all players regardless of how much or little money they can put into the game. If this can be addressed then I see no reason to not give this game a full five stars. edit: drop rates have seemingly improved so here's an extra star.",negative
Best Game Ever üíØ,positive

If you want another low quality game to throw money at this is perfect. The drop rates on even a regular character are so abysmally low i only have about 6 and thats after months of playing for free,positive
"This was my first ever Gacha game I played. I've started to play a lot of other gacha games after this and it made me realize how disheartening this games gacha pulls can be in comparison.

Just putting this out there that there's no pity system the fact the game will let you spend hundreds of dollars without garunteeing even a non limited ssr is scummy. Wouldn't recommend picking this one up,negative
"F/GO is a pretty decent game. The story is amazing, especially if you know the historical characters and understand their interactions, being a fate fan before playing this game also made it more enjoyable. HOWEVER, the pulling rates for Five Star Servants are god awful, no pity system either. If they spinning rates were improved in some way the game would be so much better...",positive
Schedule maintenance right before an event ends. They then correct the time to end the event before maintenance but didn't advertise maintenance or extend event after maintenance cutting over 8hours from people. Poor management on North America. 20k down the drain,negative
Lost my account because the developers weren't smart enough to have accounts linked to Google play but the phone being used instead. If I could give negative stars I would.,negative

good civilization,positive
This game is so BORING!!!!! Close to impossible to get SSR servants unless you top up at least a million dollars. No pity summon system. 1 quartz equals to a dollars so you need to have 30 dollars for a 10 summon. Too greedy for a game. Until now still no pity summon system.,negative
Anime waifus. Solid story. Play it.,positive
"It was a great game with a actual sense of humor, unlike a lot of games now. The only real problem are the rates, you could have tens or maybe even hundreds of rolls and not get the character you desire.",positive
Trash and you fight chairs,negative
"Putting aside the horrible rates of the gacha, the game is just horribly boring now. It's always the same kind of battles over and over, the way most events work are pretty much the same with the only new things being the story. I really wish that there can be a wider variety of battle modes rather than just tap and attack all the time. But then again, the EN version follows the JP version so why am I even feedbacking here. Not that the multimillionaire company will listen.",negative
"I've played this game since the it's launch in the USA and followed it for a while before hand. I can safely say that this is my favorite RPG on mobile. I LOVE the character designs and Noble Phantasm animations. EDIT: Seeing as we now have the QOL updates the JP has access to now, I have changed my review score. 5/5 Stars",positive

From 2 star to one star. The game is boring the gacha is too unfair. You needed points to summon servants you cant even summon two 4star servants. The cards ruin the game,negative
"Been playing since 2018, it has been a long run. I enjoyed it. But I think 2021 is not my year, it's mid year now and still no new SSR for me. I never ever ever got to celebrate this game's anniversary, I saved up too many quartz and it ends up all the same, nothing but CEs. I saved up mats, QPs, Lores and quartz for possible new SSRs but still nothing...so I ended up feeding all of these mats, lores and QPs to my lower rarity servants. This is really hell. To anyone, download at your own risk..",neutral
bruh just fix this time's bug dude. always connection lost is just annoying. nice game anyway just need fix this bug after update and all is perfect again,positive
Hmmmm Nice game but My other account can't log in again using the code transfer,positive
A single missed login and you lose ALL access to the anniversary rewards. Guess you're not allowed to play this game if you have a life. I regret giving them any money and never will again.,negative
One of the worst Rates to pull for Gacha. No pity and very outdated game. I did have fun but mostly thanks to community. Easy to lose your account. One time password system. The character design are great but it very grindy.,positive
Perfecto,positive

I cannot use saint quartz because they're free and I can only use the paid ones? This is predatory and a scam.,negative
"until account recovery/transfer is better than a password system reminiscent of the godamn NES era, i will not touch this game again.

Fun game but i having a bad luck here,positive
"Story is really good but the gameplay is boring after a while. Rate up for servants is kinda whatever since they run events where you can get decent 4star servants for free, but I dislike how long it takes to get basic materials and how much you have to run the same basic quests they've had for years now just for regular upgrades. The event rewards are worth it tho and kinda offsets this problem.",positive
"It's a pretty fun game with some great story and fun characters, but definitely needs a lot of time and dedication to progress. If you don't mind item farming and grinding, definitely worth looking into. They've got great support and help desks, just make sure to write down your game information just in case. I just wish the friends list wasn't limited to whichever language you play in.",positive
"Fantastic game with lots of content and new events quite often. Lots of grinding however so if your time constraint like me good luck. The 5* servant rates are tuff but with proper planning you'll be just fine, and keep in mind that even lower star servants can be great. Im mostly f2p but I have a lot of time played almost 1000 login days so I can honestly say this is a fantastic game, especially if you love the anime.",positive
The game is very fun and the graphics are very godtier,positive
"This game is very fun, story wise is kinda interesting, but problems such as ""I cant defeat this boss cuz im f2p"" is a big problem, and in the start, the story is kinda boring, so most of the new players ain't gonna get hooked by it, so they just play a little and leave or delete the game",positive

No replayable story quest, boss fight,.. etc. Events are less and less interesting, not newbie friendly anymore (which require Solomon arc to play). Servants are just copy and paste skills then adjust it. IAP is boring as hell. Good story, music can't save this game. At least for me.",negative

I love playing the game since it's basically a waifu/husbando simulator but I have one problem or a technical something happened to me. I bought the 18 pack saint quartz for the new GSSR banner and I only received 12 quartz and not the extra 6 quartz. Is it wrong? Or something? Can you contact me or let me know of it's a technical error on your end or something I don't know?,negative
"I have to say this game is good, but not great. The story is on point, I love the art and NP animations, but there are a couple issues. The cutscenes are aggressively long at times and the different chapters start to drag. The work to try and level up characters takes a long time too, it started to feel like the materials barely did anything. Summon rates are abysmal as well, low drop rates on Servants, even lower on 5* with no pity system and no effective way to get the currency except paying.",neutral
Summon rate kinda sucks + no pity,negative

"EDIT: -1 Star for sudden maintenance DURING time-limited event costing me servant copies/mats. Comedy, tragedy, mystery, the writing and characters are superb. Interesting without being overcomplicated.

"Being a fan of TypeMoon definetly helps with adoring this game. Its incredible! It tells full Manga Arc style storlines that are referenced in nearly every progressive story.

This is the best anime game i have played with story plot. I want to play more RPG games like this. I will be much appreciated if i get to play more fate games just like this one with new story plot and new servents too.... I am currently at Psuedo singularity 1st and i am excited to play more,positive
"Like every other review says. If you want to have fun, dont play this. There technically is no gameplay The story is an absolute drag that you would skip 92% of each singularity. The only way you can find fun in this game is if you're interested in Fate as a whole. If you're a Fate fan, then you should at least consider playing it. The servants makes it interesting. MOSTLY THEIR LORE AND DIALOGUES! YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND A WAIFU YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY IN YOUR BANK AC",positive
Dont listen to the ppl complaining about the rates like 90% of units are usable even the freind point servants are mostly good and the story is worth taking the time to play through DONT SKIP IT!!!!! Also ssr rate is 1% 0.7 for the featured ssr so ifya dont get a banner units when pulling a 5* servant thats yer bad luck also good luck in ur gacha hell,positive
"I love fate series and this game but my storage is small, im gonna buy a phone that can store Atleast 6.5gb for Fate/GO, the game is based on Historical , Myths, Legends but remember its only a fiction, it has nothing to do with real life, it is also a Gacha game but the fair part is, that u can use any characters even if its not 5 star, it can par it with 5 star characters, like Ushiwakamaru, her Noble Phantasm is strong even if shes only a 3 star Rider. Try this game if u saw my message.",positive

"Unfair, some events has very difficult quest that are impossible to beat especially if you're a new player and of course you don't have good servants to use. They are doing this to force new players to purchase in-app items to upgrade your servants and CE. How about F2P players? This game is not for everyone.",negative
Would be better if the gacha system was more forgiving. Less than 1% chance for a 5 star servant. You are more likely to get a 4 or 5 star crafting essence than you are to get a 4 star servant. Would be better if the crafting essences and the servants were in different draw pools.,positive
Love anime and game is same!,positive
It was Fun,positive
I need help my game keeps telling me I have no internet connection and to retry the connection or restart the application and I have done both still didn't work I also tried to uninstall and reinstall and it still didn't work I need help here please,positive
"Really is a great game and i don't mind the rates cuz i think its fair enough since most units are op and even with low chances I got something useful even though its a spook. Seriously this is not a waifu or husbando sim ,its main attraction is the Great story and historical figures that was combined to make it epic. Amd btw I'm a F2P player who never spend but already passed all singularity and current lostbelts cuz its not really hard to play it due to op servants even a 1 star to 3 stars.",positive

"This is one of the best games I've ever played. It is simple to get into, but there's so much depth when you start to look into things more. The story is fantastic! It's long, well thought out, with returning and new characters. The team building is a big aspect of this game if you aren't a fan of that, or turn-based RPGs, this may not be for you. But if you like them, and the fate series, there's no better game for a fan imo! Summoning rates are rather low though it is f2p friendly, be wary.",positive
Terrible gacha system and the gameplay is boring.,negative
"A nice turn-based game to kill some time with, even if you're F2P. The later part of the game does have quite a difficulty spike though, so be prepared for that. My main complaint is how it lacks a proper ""pity"" system, which apparently most gacha games have (like Genshin Impact). Once you clear most of the available battles though, the amount of summons you'll be able to do is laughable if you're F2P. The game is far too stingy with its SQ, & why I quit playing.",negative

"On one hand fgo has great animations and story, keeps you engaged and its overall a good game. On the other hand, the rates are pretty punishing and the game is a little newbie unfriendly in the sense that old event ces and servants dont come back so new players that missed them will never get them. I wish for the game to rerun the very old events or at least add new event ces with the same effects as those old ones.",positive

Would love to keep playing but uninstaled then reinstaled without knowing you cant get your account back and dont wanna start from square one again,positive
The game it self is okay medicore at best...but those damn summonings are horrible I know it's a gacha game and all but it's more like a gambling simulator..saved up 100 saint quartz( no actual money spent thank God) and tried the group summoning for the demon king....all I got was four star essences and some three star servant's then noticed that the demon king has a less than 1% chance of getting summoned...yeah I'm done with this game and I wouldn't recommend to anyone.,positive

I hate how I'm addicted to this game,negative
Events only being timed limited and have no way to play when you want and be timed gated then have to wait years for some events to return is madness and there's no mercy system in place to try and help you get the charcters you want from summons the rates are insane *low but it has strong plot points and is fun in burst of play and can itch the craving for fate content as the anime has been lacking and has very funny moments and references if you keep an eye out,positive
"great game, facinating story, fun interactions between servants but if i were to have one complain is that this game NEEDS an auto button or at the very least a resource you can use to complete a quest you've already cleared once. the ammount of time you waste farming eclipses everything else, while yes you can make ideal farm set ups youl still speed a good 15 -30 mins farming for stuff like embers or QP. becomes very tedious at times after repeating the same things 12 times in a row",positive

Its amazing you can summon servants and unlock forms and noble fantasams sad part is it requires 30 saints quartz to summon ten things and it's not guaranteed to get the servant you want so think before you install but otherwise to me it's great over all to play also it can be hard to grind 30 saints quarts and the story is really good,positive

It's a very cool and interesting game,positive
"Update: Sadly have to downgrade my review. The game simply isn't fun to play anymore and the devs do everything possible to make it a chore to play. Story is great, but 80% of the game is farming and that part sucks. Love the characters and spending time to make them stronger. Great to play before bed, and the events and story are awesome.",positive

"Game itself is good, story starts off slow but gets great, maybe one of the best available in mobile. The gacha aspect is horrible tho and why it's 4 instead of 5 stars. Very low rates, no pity system. That said the game can be completed free to play and spending isn't necessary but you will probably want to eventually and getting a rare limited servant most likely will not come cheap unless you are supremely lucky.",positive
I hate it. It is the manifestation of evil itself 5/5 stars,negative
One of the best free games you don't have to pay a dime it will be harder but you can clear everything using the free characters. The gacha might have no pity rolls and bad percenta but the free characters can carry you so it doesn't matter.,positive

"Great game. Would be great if story segments could reach the end, allow me to read the text log AND THEN move on to the battle. Give a clear gambling warning before allowing 1 tap buying, and a small but easily seen warning about gambling in the quartz buying page. It doesn't seem like a big thing, but taking gambling into account is important. Especially since many people don't think there's a gambling risk with gacha games.",neutral
"This might be a bit extra, but remember guys, each transfer code can only be used ONCE. So unless you want to go through the hassle of losing your account because you forgot to create a new code and have to send emails to recover it, like my idiotic self did, you should remember to create one after every transfer. Also great game. 8/10 (Deducted 2 for the inconvenient backup method)",positive
Gameplay is subpar but it has one of the most engaging and definitive story that you can have and it is a F2P game to boot. You can finish the quest with just 1 star units. Online interaction is just supp system with no high reward for whalers overall a loved franchise for me. Been playing it for 3 years now and it never stops to entertain me.,positive

Even though ssr are hard to get you gotta give love to some 1-3 star servant the stories are great,positive
"addictive, unique and fun. the biggest reason why it's so enjoyable to me is probably because i've had quite good luck in terms of the gacha + not had high expectations to get rare units. honestly, every unit is playable and winnable; there's a lot of diversity to appeal to everyone's tastes.",positive
The only complaint that i have is that the summoning should have a pity system so most players can get a good character after spending lots of quartz,negative
Why?? It's fate. What could've possibly go wrong with that,negative
Definitely predatory.,positive

I'm hooked becuz of the characters, the gacha is trash, story is great.

"This game has one of the BEST stories ever and I have played and watched over 3000 things. It also has a myriad of events that come periodically and each with a unique quests, storylines and rewards. The thing that makes it so amazing is the writing.

The fate/ franchise was found years ago and now I believe it is spread worldwide. What I'm asking is that you should bring not only the English voice actors but other country language voice actors as well for diversity. Also try a way to allow players to get free quartz faster. And make a way to allow us to save game progress through face or Twitter. These are the reasons why this game currently deserves 4 star rating. Thank you for reading.,positive
"They did a very creative job at modernizing the historical, mythological and other fictional characters. It's fun to hear them interact with each other. Though the events may be quite active the stories won't disappoint. The games style is fun and challenging, however, it could be dragging as you have to focus on every battles if you're not strong enough during event farming.",positive
So fun i realy recomend to play it,positive
I love the story and as a single player game its not as pay to when ad other phone games but it is obvious that buying the in game currency gives you a better chance of getting a 5 star servent still they are not required to when I put around 50 dollars in this game by buying packs when they came with deals and I fill like I got my moneys worth out of the game.,positive
it is the fearst game that i got intrested in the story,neutral

An advice to people downloading this, don't sleep on your low star servants. Most of them are great. Also, I feel the need to address this after seeing some of the reviews. SSRs aren't everything. You can literally clear 90% of the game with just 1~3 star servants. Honako Green on YT has proven that.",positive
"Story is OK, and characters are unique. Only bad thing is the summon rates are abysmal. I've spent about $20k on this game, and the rates are horrendous.

"Fate/GO is a PVE game focused on it's story and characters. The story writing becomes better overtime, while characters are varied, their gameplay mechanics is what you may be after for rolling for them. Each one of the Servants are unique and best used if the Master knows what they're doing. The difficulty curve can become overwhelming by the time you reach the new chapters.

Game doesn't have NP skip. No pity in gacha. The banners are filled with trash essence and have very low rates. At least try to seperate the CEs from units.

I've been playing the game since the the second year it came out and I've really enjoyed the anime this story of a game is why I gave it a 5 star and the gameplay mechanics would get another 5. This game makes you think before making decisions,positive
"An excellent experience. The gameplay when you look at the details actually has a lot of depth, warts and all. It's a slow burn but the story from chapter 6 starts to really engage and continues to build upon itself. I'm not going to lower my rating but the gacha (RNG character collection) is extremely unforgiving. The extremely low chance to get the 5 stars characters with a practically nonexistent guarantee is very anticlimactic. The community is fantastic.",positive

This game is really good in a lot of areas. I think the story and gameplay is really great and the events are nice too. I even think that the pulls from the quartz system are fair. My only gripe with this game is a big one. Theres not an easy way to recover data. I got a new phone and my old one got wiped which saddens me because i had a lot of event servants and was pretty far in the story and now its hard to get back into the game starting over from the begining,positive
"It has fun mechanics and gameplay and you can progress through the game using 1-3 stars. I also like that they added a support unit to make the game easier for new players. The only main problem with this game is the gacha and events. the gacha rates are terrible: 1% for a five star. I would recommend raising it to 2% and adding a pity system. Also, I feel like craft ecensses shouldn't have higher chance than actual character. Events are locked until you are deep in the game, I cant play them",positive

"Excellent storytelling (especially after 5th Singularity), lots of interesting character designs, freedom to change character's ascension look, and story and character dialogues that can be revisited at anytime.

"The writing is fantastic, don't get me wrong on that. But to get to said writing, you need to go through several singularities of more... Questionable writing. Your Gacha system has no safety net unlike virtually all of the competitors, and that just frankly doesn't cut it in 2021 especially with Cygames.

It's not perfect, the visuals are dated, the gameplay can be tedious, especially with modern event requirements, and how much grinding they force on you to finish them in a time crunch.

The gacha system is among the most brutal, and could be improved. Despite this 5/5.",positive
"Pros -Very good story, sub-stories and aftermath -Many good events with its own story plot -It uses historical figures as characters so there is something you can learn -Strategic somehow -There are also budget OP servants that can help you progress a lot in case you can't get any SR's and SSR's Cons -Some animations, cards and sprites are quite old -It's very hard to get SSR's in the game and one 10x roll cost $15 so it's expensive -No cinematics exept for the intro/lostbelt Game is great to me",positive

I have sunk a lot of time and money and haven't really regret most of it. The game is satisfying and honestly f2p friendly. It doesn't spam you with ads to spend more money, nothing is pay walled, and the game gives you viable f2p servants to use, some of them being better than their ssr counter parts. Just try this game out.",positive

"A good enough substitute for Magia Record. It is rather cool that many of the heroes are famous historical or literary characters, but I still think Magia Record was better. I miss magireco.

Just my experience, take it or leave it.",positive

It's just that when the game was accidentally erased from the phone & wasn't able to get your transfer code, it's hard to retrieve your account because the support team won't even respond to you when you message them for you to retrieve your account.

There's no auto-repeat function for battles, which makes farming ridiculously tedious. The game also lacks the ability to skip NPs which are a waste of time to watch after the 100th time.

"The summoning for heroic spirits needs to be separated from the craft eccence and 4 and 5 star card drops need to be buffed or at least cut the cost of saint quartz in half, honestly ive dumped upwards of 300 dollars on this and im not getting a tenth of the enjoyment out of it that I'd get from a console game at half that price.",positive
"This is a good game, it's just that I find it too much like pay to win. All the good characters that you want that can actually complete the higher level quests are like 0.13 or 0.43% and the crystals are not all that easy to get considering when you attack an enemy they do something called an ""overkill.""

The fact that I'm only likely to get 1 or none of the servents with that amount of quarts you can save in between plus purchased is crazy.

"I tend to delete this app for space but i always get sucked back in thanks to google targeting ads at me whenever there's a new event. Grindy, of course but still fun. Taught me how people can get addicted to these types of games. I've tried others of the same type but this is the only one that i keep coming back to.",positive
"Good gameplay, great story, albeit you need to have an general understanding of the Nasuverse to fully enjoy this game. My only gripe, as with many other players, is the gacha system that makes it nearly impossible to get the character you want. Otherwise, a great game for the fans and can potentially draw in newbies to the series. Just beware spoilers to the main series, as this doesn't bother with warnings towards some of the characters.",positive

I'm addicted to this game.,neutral
Bruh the game is legit awesome. The hate are just about them not getting their waifus or husbandos . If you like lazy gaming maybe this isn't for you cause the game forces you to play and pay attention. Which is nice since this is a strategy turn base gacha game right?,positive
"By now, we all know that gacha rate ups are a lie. Yet despite that, I absolutely fell in love with the visual novel aspect of it, the stories, the events, even the character dialogues you have in the My Room. I came here because it's Fate, but I stayed for the storylines (& gacha).",positive

The game is awesome and the customer service also. If you want to experience a game with a good story I highly recommend this game.,positive
This is a game for collectors who appreciate ALL characters and spending money is no guarentee. Also seems lik if u have technical issues give these guys a week to clear it up. Money fixed ASAP but technical issues can take a lil bit. Be more patient then I wasüòÖüòÖ,positive

"Old and dated. The Global Server of this game is just a shadow of its Japanese server. The story is great, but the UI is quite lacking, the graphics in a battle is actually amazing, but the big downfall is the gameplay. If you have around 5 hours everyday to test your will and patience into mindlessly grinding characters or spend a few hundred bucks to gamble in the game, be my guest. Don't bother asking for improvements as the game strictly follows its original JP server(which is 2 years ahead)",positive

I just learned that the developers have no intention of ever adding any quality of life features which is frankly BS.

only spent 3 years and couple hundred $ on this game would gladly do it again for okita story's good too if you're into it,positive

No pity system and too grindy.,positive
"Straight to the point. The story is the best thing about the game. There is a ton of gender swaping in the game. The rates suck, it is 1% chance for a five star. About 120 limited servants and about 20 permanent ones. It's Stamina heavy game, takes months to max out one character or years. The music is good, the combat is slow pace with no skip/auto feature. Never a discount on saint quartzs ever. Events only happen twice and no more so if you missed the first and second that's too bad.",negative

Not recommended for people who still value their sanity,positive
Awesome game. Wish they would make Saint Quartz farming quests though.,positive

Honestly really enjoy the game and for the most part i really dont have any complaints but the lack of a pity system really hurts. The last time I pulled a five star that wasnt from a guaranteed banner was around march 2020 and I usually summon on most banners that come out.,negative
"Good game with great story, fantastic voice acting and servant interaction rate up is a lie of course so if you want to get your favorite servant pray to RNGesus but still its a great rpg",positive
"Would reccomend to a TYPE MOON fan with no time for visual novels but just enough time for casual play, wants to see and use various characters. Gameplay is repetitive with grinding if, but becomes a tad bit easier when you have raised you servants to higher levels, what would you expect it is a gacha game. Overall, the story is littered with generic, weird, wacky and charming character interactions.",positive
"Game is Great overall. You don't need to spend money (Unless you really want some particular sr or ssr waifu or husbando, then get your wallets ready or just pray to RNGesus or do both.) to clear it's content and etc. Everything can be basically solved by weeks or months of grinding (which is a huge part of the game if you ask me). Anyways Imma head off with my f2p np3 summer jeanne. 3 turn farm go brrrrrr",positive
"This game is definitely not geared towards Free To Play. Even after two years and literally hundreds of hours playing, I still have issues with passing some basic content. I love the Fate franchise, but I'm done with this iteration of it, I'll just watch the numerous anime if I want my fix. If you are a whale, and have hundreds of dollars to spend... Maybe this is for you, but it's far too frustrating for ftp",positive
Very good app,positive
so far its fun,positive
"play it for the story, nothing else is of value",positive
Meh game,negative
best gacha game edit: it got boring when genshin arrived,positive
What the hell is a gacha?,negative
"Gameplay loop is unique to other gachas and quite addicting. Every servant is viable as this is strictly PVE, thus there is no emphasis on stupid luck or stupid spending. The game is quite generous free rewards and frequent events. Not only that, but the story is also quite good. This game is the whole package and easily the best Gacha I have played.",positive

It's an awesome game and I enjoy playing it üòÄ. But I'm really starting to hate gachaüò°. Other than that awesome gameüòé.,positive
Best game all time that i played,positive
"Like all gacha games, beware of GAMBLING ADDICTION--it could seriously hurt you irl! CRUEL premium gacha rates. Super attack (Noble Phantasm) animations are LONG and UNSKIPPABLE. Ultimately pretty free-to-play friendly--I've collected very good units without spending a cent. Story quality is hit or miss in the beginning, but starts getting good at the end of the 1st arc. I'm told that the few yearly Guaranteed paid gachas are the best use of real-life cash. I'm F2P btw.",positive
The game was quite fun since i always love the fate series that only thing that makes this game a little bit awful is the gatcha system like lol even if you play this game for years you won't have any single ssr servant and also i take took much time to play a single quest like 1-3 minutes or more to load the game it would been even better is the loading screen is fast.,positive
"Don't get me wrong, I love both Type-Moon as a franchise and this game, but there's a lot of flaws that make it difficult to recommend. For instance, there's nothing to do outside of the turn-based combat, no base building like in other gacha games, and the gacha system itself has drop rates so low it's borderline predatory. Plus, starting the game later puts you at a disadvantage because so much content is time-gated and temporary.",negative
Give me good luck.,positive

"Its a great game in which it gives me a review about historical figures & stuff with a different twist. Though as a person who play this game for nearly 2yrs, I'd like to have the developers take note about having SSRs a lil bit forgiving at some point aside from spending too much money for a low gacha rate. Like somewhat make it forgiving on Free to Play people out there who just wants to enjoy the game and collect their favorite servants as their achievement & trophy...",positive
It's really good game. Even low stars servants are useful if you are skilled enough.,positive
I love the game but can't help feeling ripped off due to you giving new players 28 quartz stars when I started I only got 10 so I think you guys should make it to where the people who have had it get something as well. NVM I got a five star and chloe in the magical girl event,positive
I've been playing for a few years. I have a few 5 star characters but the drop system can be a bit of a pain. Love the story and the characters.,neutral

Amazing. Just amazing,positive
The game is awesome but the space needs to be toned down like fate JP. JP takes like 1.50gb and this is taking 4.56gb,positive
I recommend Genshin impact over this games Idea of a summon system,positive
I didn't initially like FGO. I thought the card combat was dated even when it first released. I just find all of the characters compelling. There's a certain charm that's developed when I've been with these characters in an unravelling story for a few years as everyone plays a role in the story. I have issues with the friend support system as it gives me anxiety. I don't have the meta caster supports due to the gacha not having a pity system and no one uses my roster as a result. Kinda sucks.,positive
The gameplays fun. The gacha is hell. The lancer is dead. 4 stars.,negative
"Doesn't work. I get a screen telling me it's a work of fiction, and that's all. It just stays at that screen. To the person complaining that the rates are inaccurate, a 1/100 chance is not a guarantee that you will get that thing 1 time if you try 100. Each attempt has a 1/100 chance. So that 100th try is still just a 1/10p chance. Only going up to 200 tries is not enough to test it. Take it up to 1000 and see what results you get.",positive

One of the best games I ever had in my opinion.,positive
"The Game is Very Fun and Enjoying for myself and the Developer actually interact to the Player like me, Who Experience some Account Problem i just Contact them by Email and they Respond not like to other game developer who just ignore it.

"Amazing Game, and it actually fun to grind in the Game",positive
amazing.,positive
"3.5/5. The story is excellent, same with the voice acting and visuals, but the gacha is the worst experience I've ever had. Flat 1% default SSR rate, without any real pity system, and even that is split between units (which you want five copies of) and equipment (also want five copies). While low-rank cards can be leveled and carried forward, there's an obvious power difference vs. new gacha rolls. Very fun if you don't mind that, but infuriating if you enjoy rolling and getting new units.",positive
I enjoy the game cause of many waifus and exciting story lines,positive
"A gacha down to its core but full to the brim with enough waifus and husbandos that you can forget your problems. Just please, for the love of God don't spend money on saint quartz.",positive
"To be honestly, FGO has the best storyline of all gacha game I have ever played. I guess they have a lot of experience in writting story since fate stay night in 2004. The characters are really charming. I gotta say this game is the best. If you think this game is p2w, then it is not. You can beat the entire game without the need of 5 star servants. So you can completely play the games for free. The only downside is the gacha rate is really low. But that is how every gacha game go so yea.",positive

Fun game with a good story.,positive
Good game sometimes it's a lil slow but I love this game it could throw a lil high grade servants though,positive
Good gameplay and visuals but to big update sizes,positive
"The only slightly positive aspect of this game is the story. Otherwise, everything is garbage and outdated compared to modern gachas. The gacha is also one of the worst on the market. It is not okay to save for months in anticipation of your favorite character and spend the equivalent of hundreds of dollars in summoning currency only to leave empty handed. I will never support this game again and I highly advise you to stay away from the app or do not spend a penny.",negative
You can find better gatcha games.,positive

"Very expensive pay to play model, very stingly with currency and no summon pitty system. Pay hundreds/thousands for a single character or don't bother. Graphicly it isnt very good compared to other gacha games like Genshin or epic7.

There is a constant stream of new events, as well as a revival of older events.

Loved the story and started playing because I'm a big fan of the franchise. However the summon system sucks. The drop rates are not accurate and the temporary drop rate ups don't work. I performed 200 paid summons and did not get a single 5 star servant at a rate of 1% which should theoretically guarantee 1 5 star drop every 100 summons. The story was fun but not enough. I wanted to play with the characters that i got to see in the anime but not with these fake drop rates.,positive

The living embodiment of 'digital Stolkholm syndrome.' It's a meme that this game has the worst summon rates out of any gacha .The developers are extremely stingy with the premium currency. I understand that people absolutely adore this game for the story but the convolutedness and length of each story section is tedious. The game is on a one way track to being overshadowed by newer gachas that can offer what people want. For me game play is king instead of the mundane loop of each similar fight,negative
hate gacha games but im a sucker for good character designs so here we are LOL,positive
"C'mon devs, its already almost four year already. PLEASE INCREASE SERVANTS SUMMONING RATE UP AND PLEASE DO ADD PITY OR GUARANTEES SYSTEM TO THIS GAME. Everyday while play this game.

I'm free to play and have trouble getting the 5 star characters, but it's still enjoyable. wish they could use the English voice cast in the game, but I'm starting to get used to it.

"As a Fate fan, this game has been very enjoyable so far. Storyline is good, expected more from Fate but it isn't so bad. Everything else is great, music, gameplay, events, servants...etc. Only downside really is the horrible gacha rate, but this would only effect you if you want a specific servant. The game is very f2p friendly, you get plenty of 5* and 4* servants for free, and most 3* characters are not so bad. It's totally playable even without spending money.",positive

"I think that the game quality has gone up significantly since launch. A lot of frame rate stutter has been eliminated, app size reduced, and the user interface has been made more convenient, also the meta has been improved, no more berserker supremacy oh god. The story up to Solomon has reduced AP and getting up to level 100 is easy, so it won't take forever just to get to the newest events. The only thing that is missing is fully voiced story, hopefully they implement this in the future.",positive

"Been playing for 7 months now, enjoying the game due to its well written stories, awesome character design and easy to learn gameplay mechanics. You don't have to really spend a cent in-game but supporting the developers by spending is great as well. Low rarity units are useful for game contents which is great compared to other games were the low tier characters becomes unusable. Can be played casually.",positive
"Summon rates are garbage, it doesn't deliver on it's promise for 4-star summons on the 10x summon. ""Drop rates up"" on event specific summons is a total lie like all games with this mechanic. I wouldn't waste any money on this game. Thank goodness I didn't.",positive

Been years honestly playin this hame on and off the rates for units is so bad lol you can barely even get a 4 star let alone a 5 star like in general the game yes is good but the rates are horrid kinda hurts you abit if you've saved to summon and get no units at all even. Maybe have seperate banners for Units and such. I just feel like this game has potential but is so stuck in its old ways its gonna be absolutely be left in the dust when compared to new fun gachas that are making things better,positive
Watch out for this dishonest game they deliberately switched out the 7th and 14th New Year craft essences and blame it on the players even when it isn't necessary to read the patch notes. TL;DR scammer game really dishonest can't trust them even if your life depends on it.,negative
Beautiful game. Everything about it is perfect with the exception of the horrible character drop rate AND the lack of pity.,negative
The game is generous like seriously every time there's an event too much SQ the rates are kinda bad but it's a fun game the only pain is the grinding.,positive
Love the Fate sires and love the game I can't wait to start lostbelt soon I've been playing for 2 years now and I can't get enough.,positive
The game is fun but it tends to be a bit of a hastle when farming for resources so i would like to recomend an auto battle after you get a saint quartz from the encounter in the singularaties but thats just my opinion all in all it's a fun game to play,positive

If you love Fate and just wanna read the story until you're not strong enough (due to an awful gacha system) then play this. But don't put money into it. A total waste of your money, leaving you with useless characters nobody cares about. Gives you 20 summoning tickets and a bunch of gems, and when used, gives you nothing but a bunch of useless characters. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! 1* until proven otherwise...",negative

"Boring RPG mechanics to play if you're not a fan of the franchise. The battle system is slow because you have to watch every animation after activating skills as well as NPs. NPs can be shortened but can still take up to 8 secs just to pass. The effort to strengthen your characters can take weeks because of how limited exp fodder is. Events are a grind if you dont summon event CEs. So you're encouraged to summon every event, but the drop rates for characters are low so you either save or grind",positive

"Speaking as a 3 year veteran of this hell I signed up for, I do not regret it one bit. The story is engaging, gameplay is decent and team building w/o the big supports can be complex but fun to tackle. Entirely possible to play through as an F2P with only silvers, bronze and welfares alone. Only major issues are the timesink needed for events and daily farming, plus the item rates being gross at times. I would complain about the gacha rates, but a lot of others have beaten the dead horse.",negative

Is this a fantastic game and I still will support it but I gave a 4 just because when you have three stones it's annoying that you get craft essence and if the doves are looking at these reviews and they look at my reviews of this game I hope in the future they basically separate the servants and craft essence because I really want a banner that's have just servants and not craft essence I mean we can have them it's just that can they make a separate out of them,positive

The best waifu game.. All story (main or event) are always fun although the game is really grindy but you can still choose not to and just focus on other materials you need.. Game is kind enough too to give ample summoning materials.,positive
"Great characters and the gameplay is good (I guess); absolutely terrible gacha system. Whose the genius that decided you needed 30 saint quartz (which are materials that are quite a pain to collect since you only get ONE after each quest) just to summon 10 servants/craft essences that, most likely won't even be that good. And WHY is there a guaranteed summoning system that requires PAID saint quartz to use? There are SO MANY inconsistencies with the story too. This game is ultimate-level cheap.",positive

After playing and experiencing how garbage Dissidia Opera Omnia is (or has become) FGO is leagues better than it. Draw rates still kinda suck but at least its honest.

I did over √ó50 summons on rate up to get nothing but 3 stars that aren't even the correct attribute I need. Item drop ratings are also terrible and I can't ascend my Servants. Really bad drop ratings... Rate up is a big lie... never got banned character, EVER.",negative

"Fate/Grand Order is the only gacha game I can't bring myself to quit. Even after weeks or months away, I find myself crawling back. The gameplay has solid strategy/nuance with a lot to grind, and the story (despite its lackluster start) manages to keep me captivated over the years. The true appeal of this game is the servants you roll for. With so many personalities there's bound to be one to your liking. Also the doujinshi and fan art gets so much better with context",positive
I love playing this game since I'm a fan for this series. However the gacha were too cruel for me cause I used a lot of saint quatz but still can't get them. Eventually makes me fall to despair and wanna quit.,negative

"This game has a great story with well written events that offer premium items for those willing to put in the effort. Definitely not a pay to win system where even 'common' heroes can compete.

"All though simple the mechanics in this Game are quite fun to play with, but the main selling point of this game is being able to play with your favorite servants which is locked behind the Gacha system. There are a lot of useful F2P servants however,but that's not why I play these Games. I understand the abysmal rates but at least throw in a pity counter. This is the first one I have played that doesn't introduce one. Overall, pretty fun and Lax but no pity counters is a no-no for me.",positive

Love the story. Agartha and Shimousa were torture but seeing as how they're entirely optional and they had to contest with Shinjuku which gave us the beautiful duo of Jalter and Salter.

"If you like the Fate series, you will probably like this game. The combat can often feel very unfair with bosses and harder enemies, feeling like you werent meant to have a chance. The story is fine, nothing incredible but enough to give the game some depth. The gacha system is kind of frustrating, the game is really tough if you dont have a team of 4 stars or some HEAVILY leveled 3 star servants.

Quality control is needed there c'mon it's been yrs now.",negative
Only problem so far is the drop rates.,negative
The game has a lot of content and a rich story. There is a very big list of memorable characters. There are challenging fights that are fun to tackle. Although money is not needed to play the game (and clear high level content); the rate for SR and SSR characters is very rough (although its kinda easy to get used to it... and it can be argued that the drop rate makes getting that one SR or SSR character even more exciting). Also its kinda fun if you want to get exposed to historical figures.,positive
"A pretty unique experience, worth every hour I've played it",positive
"Pros: 1) Free or easy (1-3 stars) to obtain units are sufficient to get you through everything if you have a good, working team. 2) If you like Fate series, this would give you more in depth story to the Fate universe (not to mention you can control your favorite servants!). 3) There are events with certain storylines, which you could use to easily farm certain materials that you need for leveling your servants. Not to mention these events usually gives away a good 4 stars servants that you can't get anywhere/time else. 4) The English version FGO is slower than the JP FGO by 2 years. Even though we don't get the latest content, this is actually a good way for you to look at the JP events/banners and plan up ahead on which servants you want to save up for, and what events you would want to participate in. We are literally following the same (there are some tiny exceptions to this) timeline as the JP server. 5) Have a sense of what rare or super rare is. Probably not a big problem for many gamers, but I do know some other gacha games would make their rare units doesn't seem/feel rare (or rather common) at all. Here, rare is just rare, and super rare really live up to its name. Cons: 1) The game is really oriented on the story mode and events. Other than those, you are virtually left with nothing to do other than grinding some materials from places you have cleared (even so the item drop rates can be low. advised to use vents to actually get these materials). No PVP/Guild/Achievement system like other RPGs. 2) Essentially a visual novel with fighting parts being the only thing you can mostly control. At most, the choices you made during stories would only determine if you would fight certain mounters/difficulty, even so is not a common thing, and what you choose in dialogue doesn't affect your story line. Also most dialogues are not voiced in the story. 3) The rarity is real, which means you can't get your favorite servant right of the bat even if you want to pay $10000 (5 stars hero drop rate are super low and some are time limited). The best way to get your favorite hero without wasting too much money (or if you are FTP person) is to look for the future banners, plan up and save summoning crystals for that banner. Note that your favorite hero's rate up event may not appear up to a year or even more. 4) Certain events require you to finish a high level story chapter. So if you want to participate with low level servants, you got to pass through the chapters with the use of some quartz and/or command spells. 5) One sad fact is you can't go back to certain story modes and re experience the boss fight that you completed. Especially if you are rushing through stories to participate in events. Overall it is a good game, not where you must spend your money to play. But certainly if you want to collect your favorite servant, it probably won't happen very soon. The one worry I have is how this game can survive for the next upcoming years with other gacha games becoming more fun & unique (more stuffs to do) than FGO.",positive
Very free to play friendly. Planning to buy saint quartz for the new year gssr banner ;>,positive
It was fun at first but what really wasn't fun after trying to summon a hero 40 times and only getting one 5 star hero and nothing else other then 3 star heroes and it's fine until you get later into the story where your heroes have a level cap and you have to gather materials but they make that difficult and it takes too much grinding to do it and if you dont you will get stuck I barely got past the third singularity so all in all they just make it too difficult and it forces you to spend money,positive

"Trying to get my account back, emailed support MONTHS ago and they never replied.

I like the game just a bit disapointed that i forgot to get a new tranfer number before getting a new phone,positive

"Rates are horrible. You're going to get stuck with the worst units. There's no pity system and it takes a while to get a single multipull. When you do get a multipull its not even guaranteed you'll get a unit. You can get craft essences from pulls which don't really do much for you as a beginner. Too many hard earned pulls where all i get are craft essences. Fate is known for its heroes/servants but all you'll get are craft essences from pulls. Disappointing. No auto, outdated gameplay & graphic",negative
"One of the most famous and infamous gacha. The fact that you can't pity anything is a big downside, but everything else is very nice",positive
"Horrid gacha, cute girls.",negative
"Longtime player (2 years +) and fan of the series. I love the game - the story, art, and characters are all top notch - but the gacha is terrible. Having paid plenty into the game, BEWARE - have spent 500sq before with no SR or SSR. With a system that allows multiple copies of a servant to be fused to power them up, there is no excuse to not have a pity rate, other than outdated thinking. Whales would still whale for np5 SSRs, while lower tier collectors and f2p would be more inclined to buy in.",negative
This game looks amazing but due to the fact I'm unable to play it I give it 1 star. Everytime I open the app the screen goes black but the music continues to play. I've uninstalled the app and currently attempting to reinstall and try again if it works I'll gladly change my rating. I'm back 3 years later and I will say the game has changed and upgraded alot the game doesn't crash on me anymore. The gameplay is smooth the many stories are very entertaining AND it's not pay to win.,positive

"Okay so I've been playing for around 3 yrs. Gacha can be pretty damn bad, the first 5 story singularitys are kinda bad however it picks up on the 6th and onwards. F2P is good somewhat cause you can always make them stronger for harder challenges. My main issues are that you have to make sure you make a transfer code cause if you don't and let's say you wanna pick it up later well whatever you had is now gone since you didn't make a transfer code. I hope they will make it a bind system soon.",positive

Best gacha and the most F2P friendly by far,positive
I've been playing since the beginning. And it has had a few rough times but I must give props to the people who work on this game it's amazing now. And I love how they keep it fresh instead of just letting it become stagnant like many games based off of anime do. I'm pretty sure this is the first 5* rating I've ever given.,positive

"Despite a phenomenal story, FGO is one of the least fun gacha games out there. The event structure is awful, with many limited time events so that players fear missing out will play more. The story content is awfully paced, filling it with more battles than necessary so you play more. Story content is extremely hard so that players will grind more, and there is no autoplay so you have to sit through boring repetitive grind. All so you are more likely to spend money. Just watch the story.",negative

Also, some of them can even become iconic gaming icons. Gameplay is very addicting when you get into it, making you not wanting to stop playing. Story is very compelling which keeps a hold on you. Making you want to play to the bitter end. Even has some great music to listen to.",positive
Nice and cool,positive
"Overall FGO is a good game with a very acquired taste. Its gacha to the core, pull rates are extremely low with a stingy currency, saving for certains banners is your only hope. Gameplay is fun but outside of story and event its very grinding and can be very boring. Too off set the grind the game gives daily material login to help slightly. The story of the game is absolutley amazing in the lost belt chapters. The story is where its really at. I wouldnt recommend for inexpeirienced gacha players",positive
"No auto battle, no summon pity, terrible UI, outdated engine, zero quality of life for players. Great story, great characters, terrible chance of getting them. Could be a good game, hopefully they completely overhaul the train wreck, then it may be considered a good game if this were still 2015.",positive

"This game has an excellent story, with diverse characters and satisfying combat that is rewarded by diligence and planning. That said, it suffers from a few problems-- it's an exhausting grindfest for materials to level your servents, rolling the gacha has terrible odds for a 5 star, and free currency to do so is very scarce. Google gacha games before you spend money to know what you are getting into. That all said- this is my favorite game and I find it highly satisfying. Good luck!",positive

"Awesome game and f2p friendly, but there are still some stuff that needs tweaking, namely: 1) Friend support selection is weird, let us filter the friend supports through what CEs they have and remove the randomization of friend supports, it's annoying when I have to manually update my support up to 7 times just to pick the one I used last time. 2)Focus the updates on the much needed servs, such as the ones in the low-rarity.",positive

"The game itself is slightly above average, but the VN aspect & attachment to Fate grant more uniqueness. However, what stops me from giving this game a high rating is that it relies on RNG to get characters. If I want a character in realistic timespan, I must get unreasonably lucky or spend money. That's bad. I'd rather unlock characters purely by playing the game, & any character in the gacha, I'd like to purchase separately to add to the cards I can draw by playing levels. Story's GOOD though",positive

"Not for ftp. You roll units with materials so chances of you even getting event units are really really low. Art is very iffy at times and gameplay consumes too much time I'd rather use elsewhere. Don't give much as prizes or for free in events or whatnot. Again you have to play for it most of the time, which is time consuming and very very repetitive. Would only recommend to a diehard fgo fan or if you're the type to like what I saw as a negative",positive

There are a lot of reasons why I should uninstall this game or say that this game sucks but.. HELL NAH.

Great game have been enjoying it for years now,positive
This is a great game when things go well for you. Gacha rates drain you and grinding can only get so many saint quartz. Ultimately this is a game that is unfriendly to poor individuals since you almost certainly won't get many good pulls even spending money. One big problem is the coding. Something about the coding in the servers cause all kinds of errors and it isn't hard to lose accounts due to lack of email binding. This is fun when it works. Too bad it has so much going against it.,negative

"The game is fun. But over relies on gacha (loot box) at times, over valued microtrandations, $1.50 au for 1 sq (premium currency). Can't say this game is not going to be a target for regulation around the world after EA is done in court for the same practices. The game really needs a revamp on rates and prices as well as alternative means to obtain rare characters, which are not gacha centralised. Its fun but the business practices are greedy like EA who are currently in court around the world",positive

"1.unf2p friendly. 2. Still a gacha thats very old school, pray on players with unforgivable drop rates.3. Same game since release.4. Lack of content. All you really just do is grind materials for servants with very little outside of story and event stories with some being story lock. In this day and age where many gacha games provide pity system to compensate for poor summon rates and provide more content.

Here's my warning, don't get too hung up on the summoning rates. Yes, the system has a low summon percentage but there are times when you'll get lucky. There are also a number of events that are starting to populate that will get you some pretty awesome servants. So don't worry if you couldn't pull who you wanted the first time.",positive
"Drop rate increase is a f'ing lie. Don't pay anything into this game, spent 160 st quarts I save and didn't get the servant with the suposid drop rate increase. One of the rolls I got all 3 star so much for 1- 4 star guaranteed. Wish you can rate no stars cuz that's what it deserves.",positive
"Terrible, 6 multi summons, 5 single summons, and 15 tickets used, and i couldn't even get Shiki, i will change this review when I get either the event Shiki or the banner shiki",negative

"I love Fate. Especially the characters. Favorite being Cu Chulainn. Emiya is cool too. Wish saint quartz was easier to save though. Other than that I unexpectedly found myself addicted. Usually not my type of game Great game, but the file just keeps getting bigger and bigger. My Samsung hit it's file size today and while I deleted a different app. I might have to delete this one if it hits it again and it's very saddening.",positive

I lost my account due to the device breaking and on the day I sent the email in the morning to support asking if they could recover and return my account to me. They replied back later on the same day sometime in the afternoon with a transfer code and password. Safe to say I was extremely happy with the quick response as well as getting my account back.,positive
"Solid gameplay and story but with nice events but at thus point,im currently looking at different games 1. Difficult to transfer game data 2.while the gameplay is good, it can be boring and tedious at times not to mention multiple battles required to get a new area 3.the rates...why? You saved up 200+ quarts?,have 7 4* essence,this game has by far the single worst rates for characters i've ever seen!

"If this game had a voice over for the storyline, that would have been amazing!!! You get to see a lot of the servants in the nasuverse. Even though the gatcha system is tough on you especially for fgo, you can still run through most of the game with average 3 star servants. Just learn good team compilations and how to level them up and your good. As for the asthetics, the servant portrait cards looks nice. Wish the sprites were better though.",positive

Changed to 5 star review cause why not :D,negative
Great thank you for giving my waifu at lvl 15 Plss developers add some filipino servants like andres bonifacio or like general juan luna. Thaw would be great.,positive
"Solid gameplay, highly predatory practices. I want to rate this game higher because it has actual gameplay story & strategy. The big issue is the monetary aspect. Probably the worst of all the games I've played. You can spend hundreds of dollars & not even get a new unit or a 5* character/ the featured unit you really wanted. And this is something they are proud of. They never even have sales, or guaranteed drops/per summon like other games. Money could be better spent elsewhere. Get a Switch",positive
Game crash constantly,negative
"It's a good game as is, but there are so many things that can be done to make it even better. So until those changes come until play it'll stay at 4 stars.",positive
"Wish I could give a 0 star rating after wasting over 100 currency and not even getting a 4 star. Gatch rate is complete bs. I've never gotten 5 star from a 10 summon. I play Azure Lane too, and that game you can pretty easily get the characters you want without paying. Pretty much the only reason to pay there is for skins, which doesn't limit your gameplay like this game does where you can't get good characters without paying. Gameplay is also repetitive and boring.",positive

"There is one major problem with this game straight off the bat. Your account isnt saved to a cloud or backup. If you end up losing your file doesnt matter if it was by an accident or ur device broke, the developers obviously dont care.

Events are a blast to play through as well. If you like the Fate franchise or a great game in general, give Fate Grand Order a shot. Just be patient, in time you will get better.",positive
"The support team got my account back. (I haven't logged in over a year and I forgot my transfer id) It took only two or so days.

Something about the formatting is just weird but the story based stuff is alright,positive
I've been playing this game since release a good game,positive
"Pros: 1. Great story 2. All servants, even 3* servants can come a long way if you can strategize properly (you can play as F2P) 3. They keep older servants relevant, hence you can progress the story without having to roll for a new servants. 4. Regular updates with new content and events. Cons: EXTREMELY HORRENDOUS GACHA RATE My worst roll record is 1100 sq without getting a single SSR servant (you can do the math) It's called unlimited saltworks for a reason.",negative
Love the story anf the thrill of when I get a rare summon or a completely random summon. Has anyone got child gil from friend point summoning because that's how I got him and it certainly surprised me.,positive

A fun game the story is interesting the gameplay is thoughtful and the characters *mwah* I know there is gatcha salt but it isn't too terrible and the community more than makes up for it. Not for everyone but I have and will continue to get my kicks from it.,positive
"Played the game for a year, spent over 700sq and never got a 5 star. I gave this game a chance the story is ok, but the grind makes it boring. You are better off watching the new anime that are coming out for it. Friend played for less time and got 3 5 stars. I am F2P, but the prices for Sq are terrible as well.",positive
"Stupid gacha, but nice gameplay",positive
"Story, events and characters have great story telling, but on the flipside compared to other gatcha games the daily and story/event rewards are as trash as their drop rates",positive
"To participate in certain holiday events, you need to complete late game story. Requirement Lostbelt 2. I'm not even halfway done to be able to participate in events..",positive
Truly this is the ONLY game I'll ever need on my phone. I only wish I was active enough to dedicate getting the characters I want to get and level them up! XD I highly recommend this game if you're into this sort of thing.,positive

It's just good.,positive
"The real OG when it comes to gacha salt. Character designs are top tier, the devs are mad lads who either dry us up or spoil us rotten (look towards the skadi release event with the pure insane amounts of currency given out) and real memey/satirical dialogue that's been changed from JP to a certain degree for fun. The gacha is just gacha it wants you to spend big to win big even if you don't spend or spend much you can be f2p since the low rarity units are just as good or better then others.",positive
4 stars cause love the game but gacha is awful :D,positive
If you set out to actually roll for Servants then dont expect to get ANYTHING you want unless you pay upwards to $200 at times. The drop rates for the good Servants are incredibly low and they're usually the Servants you want. To top it all off a lot of them are event exclusive as well so you have a limited time to give the game all your money to get what you want,positive
If you love Fate. You have to play this..,positive
I am still bothered by the gacha rates but I dig the animations for my favorite servant kiyohime,positive
"Great game, gacha so money sink enabled. That said, you don't need to spend a dime as not only are the f2p characters good, some of them are better than the SR/SSR characters, and thusly everything in the game can be cleared with those units. Story takes a bit to pick up, but when it does it yeets itself into the stratoshpere and doesn't stop. Very good game overall",positive
Its really fun the only problems i keep encountering is certain units dont show up after clearing a chapter and theirs no way to back up ur gsme data,positive

This game is a fun exploration of the Fate Franchise and is completely free to play. Money does potentially boost your likelihood of getting better characters but because there is no PVP system this does not cause any issues.,positive

Great game but it doesn't take long to eat up a bunch of space especially with it being updated so often. It is nice that they give the game so much attention so it's not really a bad thing that it gets updated so often.,positive

It has a unique collecting feel to it while you get to play them in game with a cool art style,positive
I am a F2P player and if you dont play for every 5 star character and plan ahead you will most likely get what you want. I myself have saved for 12 SSR characters and have got them all. If you dont like to wait months just to get a character then this is not the game for you. Also the story and gameplay is amazing so I think it's quite rude to rate 1 star only because you dont have the patience to wait for your characters.,positive
"Good game, decent story with high stakes. Very good art. Needs more spiders though.",positive
It's fun characters are interesting summons are cool wish there were more ways to get fragments to summon tho,positive

It seems simple at first. But the gameplay became much more tactical when enemies became more diverse with status effects and skills. (Tbh I play for the story and gameplay) Plus you don't need to pay money for some fun. I'm a free to play player and I'm already in love with this game,positive
Now i fixed my rating thanks for fixing the problem,positive
"I'll be honest with you. I love the anime Fate/Zero, UBW, but this game was hard to get into in the beginning. Mechanics etc were difficult to understand so I actually uninstalled it twice. Tried again because a friend asked me to, and this time with him to help me understand, this game is one of the best time burner to invest in. Perfect.",positive

Boring game!!!! Repeatative gameplay. Graphics is bad. Story is Bad.,negative
"Gonna admit, I'm shaking my head at those of you who dropped the game just because of bad Gacha rates. Though it's understandable that you'd be frustrated, but still. And to you prospecting players, the game is still fully playable even without the need of you whipping out that credit card. My advice: Play up to the 3rd chapter first, then make your decision. I promise this game won't disappoint. Lost your account and didn't make a transfer code? Customer support, 10/10 would recommend",positive

"Been playing for 2 years and while most of the gacha rates are insane (like 0.07% to get a 5-star servant on a regular day and 2% if it was rated UP), the grinding of ascension and skill mats are tedious, FGO is still amazing with the stories and characters. It's not some generic shounen story and the events are always fun to play. I only gave it 4 stars because the English servers always remove the April Fools event for some reason and the maintenance times are janky.",positive

Strong storyline and unique battle mechanics. The only problem is the gatcha rate for 5‚òÜ units.,negative
Fun gacha game. Do note that you may not get the character you're gunning for luck is involved here. Sometimes you get lucky sometimes you don't. Investment is rewarded in this game you can turn most characters good with enough investment and thinking. Communication with the devs is not very good and other forms like fan run Twitters or the r/grand order reddit holds better information. Again remember it's a gacha game and sometimes you just don't get what you want.,positive

"I absolutely love this game! Alright, real talk: it is an (arguably) pay-to-win waifu collection simulator. Beyond that, however, lies deep characters, a fascinating story, and a challenging strategy-driven game. People may be somewhat turned away by the gacha rates, but that alone is not enough to dismiss this game. With all said and done, if you want to play something fun and interesting that isn't riddled with marketing plots (rate-up doesn't count, shhh), then try FGO.",positive
This game makes me very angry and depressed.,negative
"Good game but needs a better gacha system, at least with the rates",positive
"Love the Fate franchise that I cosplayed as Astolfo for one anime convention held in New Orleans. Anyway, it's a cool game if you have a favorite character/waifu in the series lol I personally don't pick favorites Update: the only bad thing behind it is that I've to constantly uninstall apps on my phone whenever there's an update/new event coming up. Sooner or later I'll have to get a new phone.",positive

"I'm sick and tired of sitting through an hour long tutorial where it basically forces me to press the stupid highlighted circle for and hour or so. there should be an option to skip it. same with the summons, I have to sit through the summons for 30 mins only to find out I got nothing worth while, how fun.",negative
"The only online game that I loved that daily logging in becsme a part of my routine. One of the things that I loved in this game is that even low ranked servants can be used efficiently if you lack high ranking servants, provided that you enhance then to the best of their abilities. Though gacha roll is so difficult to get even one 4-star servant, for someone like me who plays this for free and for fun, I give this a rating of 5-stars. Nice gane üëç",positive

Great characters,positive
"Really great game. Really great story. Really great characters. However, I'm not a fan of the idea that my party don't gain experience from combat. Of course it's still a gacha game as well and as a result it's a money sink. Want your favorite character like Altria Pendragon, Gilgamesh or Jeanne d'Arc? You're waiting for a special event where they have a slightly higher chance to summon and praying you get them with your free quartz or buying quartz and still hoping you land the 5% drop chance.",positive

More years of success for this game, may you not grow tired of adding and improving this game that (not only me but also all the fans of the Fate Series), we love o' so much. 5‚òÖ for me because: unlike other gacha games I've played so far, this has the true nature of the word ""gacha"" game. That for me is reason enough to give it 5‚òÖ.",positive

Great game even for a gacha. Plus you don't need 5star servants to win there for its not pay to win at all. Mostly the game is roll for your waifuu and play.

I don't recommend this game to anyone because of that.",negative
"The worst gacha I ever touched. Dropped after 2 hours. The rates are awful, the currency is awful, the gameplay is absolutely terrible, and the games graphics have aged very poorly. Surprised this gacha is amongst the top grossing. Avoid if you can. The story and characters are cliche anime, which is personally not my thing. I like the portrait art and some character designs (fran!) but thats all I can give this game.",negative
Nice game very addicting,positive
There is a lot to love here... Unfortunately it has one of the absolute most brutal gacha in the genre and barely gives out free currency. Very bad pull rates. No auto battle either making the game an extreme grind that demands your constant attention. It could be so much better.,neutral

Above all, the gameplay mechanics are fun and engaging without being overly complex or easy.",positive

"This was the first gacha game I've ever gotten into and this game, at least to me, gave me an experience far beyond a simple high for rolling for a waifus and husbandos. The main story in this game that's been continuously developed has drawn more raw emotion and heartbreak and hope from me than most books or even movies I've seen before, and it really just gets better as the story progresses. Play for your waifu, play for the story, it's really up to you on what you choose to get out of it.",positive

"If you're wanting to play this game because you saw a rare servant you wanted to get your hands on, let me be the first to tell you not to get your hopes up. While the gatcha rates *are* downright evil, if you don't really care about that all the servants 3 star and up are perfectly usable for the whole story. The one upside to the ultra low SSR rate is that SSR's really do feel super rare. The story has been really enjoyable thus far, on par with a high quality visual novel. You can sink as much or as little time into this game as you want and there's no need to spend any money at all if you don't want to.",positive

"It's a neat little game but the cash for credits system is a bit pricey. excellent story elements but some areas could use a little touching up. If it wasn't for the free gapture and in game free credits you'd never get a servant. However it is a long haul game, while it encouages casuals, if you want to keep up with events you need to play hardcore for a bit.",positive

I lost my account due to negligence. Even though I am free to play customer service was super courteous and prompt to address the issue.,positive
"This game is fun for any fate fan. But beware because it has the potential to be a money sink. My only real gripe is the gatcha rates but it can be mitigated as well as the fact that you don't necessarily need 5 stars to clear difficult content but they do make it easier. It has been the only gatcha that I have played consistently for 2 years. It is also loads more fun with friend so you can compare with. Also multiple play styles to choose from in buster, arts, quick.",positive

Love this game playing all day everyday however i have something that i would like you to add and its the onr thing that all games have it is patch for fullview display patch because the most of new phones have the gull view display and without that patch we have some black lines in the sides of the game let me describe it better the game screen is in the center of our screen and we have big black lines on left and right side of our screen but if you add patch it will be fixed plz add itüôèüôè,positive
"So it's based off the fate series (duh), but my gosh is it amazing. You dont need money to play. You can log in at any time and still have fun. There's a massive story line that is actually entertaining, and all the characters have a personality of their own. Amazing graphics with animation! They have events often for players who complete the storyline which make it even better! I've been playing for a while, jumping in whenever I'm bored. 5/5 because it deserves it!",positive

I've tried a lot of different mobile games in my life but Fate GO stands out as a stellar example.

It isn't flawless by any means but I genuinely recommend it as a quality game.,positive
The best gacha game ever. I'd love to stay but I wont have much free time anymore.,positive
"If your a fan of waifus and/or fate then you will feel right at home here. The story in true fate fashion takes it's time to flesh out and the gameplay, while old-fashioned, is solid. Every servant is viable, but it will fall on you to come up plans to win with them. Or you could look up strats from...other sources. Events do give out free 4 * servants sometimes so watch out for those. Be warned though, gacha is hell and the grind is real.",positive
"Good game, im a fan of fate series I've been playing this game for almost 3 years. Good storyline and ost. The gacha system is literally hard which is good for me. Getting an ssr that hard is what u can really call ssr. I also like how easy the gameplay is and it is all about strategy which is also good for me. Even it needs a lot of investment.",positive

"One of the best gacha game around. The gameplay is simple and easy to understand although a lot of the battle mechanics need a bit of research, otherwise it's fine. The storyline is just top-notch especially starting from Camelot arc and beyond. The gacha rate for SSRs is quite abysmal and alot of people quit over it, however you don't need high rarity to clear the game or specific units to clear quests because all servants are usable with a bit of planning.",positive

Most can't even participate due to lack of characters or having to meet specific story progression, also wished that item drops were doubled because we've all struggled to get the ce drop and could go the whole event without getting it but just a suggestion.",negative
"This game is simply amazing. The story is pretty oof in the beginning but it gets a lot better after the 5th singularity, especially now that lostbelt is about to release. The only thing thats kind of annoyoing is that you have to grind quite a bit for resources such as SQ or Ascension materials. The gacha rates for 5 star servants and even 4 stars servants are absolute TRASH, but thats what makes it so fun and exciting when you get your desired servant. Overall my favorite mobile game.",positive

Depressing when months worth of saving amounts to nothing. Wait till 5th anni for the first real free 5 star. Even then its a select pool which amounys to just picking El Melloi/ Waver. If they could be more generous woth saint quartz that would be fine but you get like 5 or so weekly. Not worth summoning unless its Gssr which still requires you to pay. Im still gonna play cause of sunk cost fallacy.,positive

It's fun and has a great story but if you want to get your favorite servant you have to put that money in also I hope that this learn from Azur Lane and let us save our account the feeling of losing an account you put your money blood sweat and tears in is something that will make some people stop playing all together,positive
"Too much time spent for so little reward. The Gacha system has ridiculous odds and after saving for months I still got nothing.

This game rewards those with the dedication to continue on with the story and their servants and is definitely shown in their events. Overall wonderful experience and continue to play and have max ascended a few characters . :)",positive
"The first few singularities are a little bland, but it definitely picks up. The various art styles are also a nice touch. From what I've seen, this is one of the more F2P friendly gacha games.

"Most people say that the gacha is horrible, and while the rates are really bad compared to other gacha games, there are a good number of non-four/five star servants or free four stars you can get that make it so that even 2 years into the game I still haven't spent money. Play for long enough and don't be dumb with your Quartz, and you'll get the servants you want eventually. The story is very good imo, and I love how it plays dearly that even though it's older and it shows, I will keep lovingit",positive
"This game is awesome! My wife & I both have been playing this game since late 2017. We would agree the gacha system could be a little better, but we do pretty well and we don't just grind all day. We maybe play a couple hours a day/night if that. We also don't spend money on the game. From what I can tell from reviews, is that most of the people complaining are people brand new to the game and just want it to be super easy to be super awesome without really putting in time. That's all I got.",positive
If youre wanting to play as a free to play person its a slow grind but absolutely possible to have that way. I had a lot of fun just using some of my favorite servants from the show. If you dont get the Servant you want you could borrow it from the support list and possibly even friend the person who has it.,positive
"1. This gatcha is known for being stingy on gold servants. Which would be a problem except... 2. You don't even need 5* Sevants if you put in the effort with what you get. You'd be surprised with what 3* and lower can do with work. 3. You can earn Saint Quartz by log in streak, doing story mode, or events. 4. F2P's gotta spend their quartz wisely. There's no promise you'll get what you want. Look stuff up and learn to plan. 5. Screwed up? You can start a new game by clearing the cache.",negative
If you are Fate/Stay this game will be a great fit for you. Play much like visual novel with RPG elements. Really enjoyed my time with it. Would play at anytime.,positive
So many hours and a lot of fun this game is my fandom and my addiction. They give you better servants in events and such easier than the gacha. But I disagree with the gacha hell claims. Edit: Still after three years of play i can still say fgo is the only mobile game to keep my attention. A few points I would like to add is how the 4 and 5 star servants are not the only good servants in the game and that the 3 star and below are just as viable to use as any 5 star.,negative

"750 days in, 500USD later, still a happy player",positive
"Great story, with great art. Gameplay's easy but hard to master. Best part is, unlike other gachas, your 1-3 star heroes are actually still useful and not just fodder.",positive
Best mobile game I have ever played.,positive
"This where i grind for exp for my fave servants ...... And patience, a lot of it.",positive
"This game is practically for FATE SERIES FANS! Otherwise, you will find it hard to love FGO. Gacha System is ""Garbage"". F2P or P2W, you need LUCK to get the SR and SSR servants you want. 1 to 3 ‚òÖ servants are also as useful at Max Lvl. F2P-friendly. It's Grind over money. The only thing you can buy with real money is Saint Quartz for summoning. As for the materials, you grind. Events is best grinding ground. Lastly, story-rich. If you're into TypeMoon series, the stories are all connected.",positive
"How to play: Just get lucky. Option 2: Bring out Wallet-kun. (People complaining about the low rarity servants doesn't deserve to play this game. Also, if you make mistakes, its your fault and not the game's. And why complain about buying resources to spend on the game? Its a GACHA game. Get out of here.) *You can start a new game. Just clear game data.",negative
When is it launching in the UK,neutral
"The gacha rates suck haha, i love the game tho",positive
"This game is great. They introduce new characters all the time. They have fun seasonal events. It's possible to get all the characters you want without spending money as long as you're not too greedy and play smart. You can level up and use your characters immediately. They give you a lot of free 4* servants that are good. I've been playing for 4-5 years now. I played the Japanese version, so it's nice to actually be able to read what's going on.",positive
Welcome to the hell of gacha y farm,negative
I've been playing for 500 days now. fgo is a phenomenal game with interesting lore and characters. i wouldnt recommend it if you cant handle the salt tho.,positive
I hope they fix the UI and give animation update to old servants,positive
NO SSR REEEEEEE,negative
"I love the game its a good time waster, and the gacha is has been very generous to me being a FTP and all. Always go for the free 4 stars as many of them are better than some 5 stars, and well if were being honest I only really like the game because my favorite servants ishtar came to me sole one ticket summons. And same with ereshkigal so im probably being biased. Anyway gatcha rates are fair. Lmao",positive
My luck is pretty good so i get all 5 stars i wanna roll for without having to whale,positive
"I enjoy the game very much. I have been playing for around 9 months and I love the events, in particular. I am mostly an F2P player but I buy SQs to try for some fate husbando materials like Arthur, Cuserker and Archer Gil, still no success though ü§£. Although, I also get good 4 and 5 stars out of free saint quartz sometimes, so not really complaining.",positive
"Lost my account but customer service was great they helped recover it twice. Great game too, keeps you busy if you're looking for grind distraction and cool characters",positive

"It's a really enjoyable game to play during your free time. Despite it being an old game, it still manages to get you invested, with it's use of story and different character/abilities. With many fan-favorite characters, it's not unusual or suprising for one to start to become invested in a game like this. After almost 2 months of playing this game, I will say that I have never once considered this game to be 'boring' or 'not fun'. If you want to immerse yourself into the world of Fate, play it.",positive

As far I remember i have been and always be a fan of Fate series even this game is very interesting and I enjoy a lot with the help of those great artist making those art is a plus for me and the battle system are so great.,positive
It's a fate mobile game.,neutral
Gacha system sucks,negative
"Gacha is balanced. Obviously better rates would be nicer but I'm free-to-play and have still managed to pull a lot of 5* ssr servants. A lot of people complaining about the gacha, but it's actually fine. Good game.",positive
"I love this game so much, even as a f2p you can also progress very high at story modes and challenge quests",positive
Gacha is poopoo. That is all.,neutral
"As a huge fan of the Fate series, I really wanted to experience this game for myself. The gacha rates are tremendously low, but this game shows you that you don't need expensive units to win a fight. You can easily cheese a boss with low rarity servants and the right setup. It gets really grindy at times, but that's to be expected of when you have many servants to level up.",positive
Its was working perfectly but not it's not trying to load and I dont want to start over again what should I do,positive
To all EX rank player damn you guys are very lucky that's included myself and to all E luck player or below just survive dude and that's also included myself üòÇüòÇüòÇ . I say that cause i have 2 account and 1 of them is luckier than the other,positive
"I love this game. Fate fan or otherwise. The story, the OSTs, and the gameplay are amazing. Some of the music sends chills up my spine from time to time. The gameplay is pretty tedious, but I wouldn't recommend playing this game 24/7/365 otherwise you'll get burned out. I'd recommend to at least play until the natural AP bar is gone. This gacha game is one of my favorites, but some times I feel like they should space the events out with a one week break so it doesn't feel like a barrage.",positive
I just lost my account after update what the hell I want my account I tried to get my account even after sending e mail but nothing helped please given me my account,negative
"You make it impossible to log into an account I had previously. I put work and money into that account. You also have no auto button. Yeah its ok to fight manually, but i work 2 jobs. Dont have time to do it all by hand. Do some quality of life enhancements You get the 1 * you deserve.",positive
If you enjoy fate franchise and servant lore this game is a good way to discover different servants. Don't mind the salt be f2p and enjoy whatever you can get. You don't need ssr servants to finish story content.,positive
"Favorite app. The gameplay is fun and allows for building a team that employs whatever type of moves you prefer. With a strategy and some lucky pulls, you can dominate. The story is engaging and honestly, really is great for anybody who enjoys anime.",positive
"Bought items, got triple charged. They refused refund. Do not buy anything!",negative
The game is fun and great to play but getting the crystals to use the gacha is a pain and even grinding isn't helpful because half or more of your energy will be consumed trying to get crystal and then the gacha function is hell unless your family works at the studio making the game you'll rarely get any good servants even if you do use the 30 gems feature also if you're a free to play you better save the gems until you see a banner that you really want to spend 30 plus gems on,positive
I can't stand the animations. Look janky and awkward,negative
"Excellent story, excellent characters and having different artist makes the art refreshing but be prepared as gacha will make you saltier than dead sea.",negative

Great game with a great background and lore base; art and playability are superb. But after a while youre AP starved. Me for example can play 15mins a day and then have to wait 12 hours for another 15mins.... thats not good at all,positive

"Gacha system is abysmal. The chances of getting a 5-star servant are the same odds as sticking your index finger into an electric pencil sharpener and it coming out unscathed. I've wasted hours and hundreds of summons only to get absolute garbage, which is really sad, because I genuinely liked the story, characters and gameplay, but the game had to be ruined by a gacha system the likes of which could make the most sane man tear the hair out of his own head. Good game otherwise.",positive

"cursed gacha hell taught me to appreciate SQ more, and pray more because luck did not come easily unless EX luck but story and waifus all are amazing design and good plot.",positive
"Great game especially if your waifu is from fate franchise! Yes the gacha rate is bad but it's not like you have to pay to advance in the game as many of the lower rarity servants are good and strong. Don't be one of those who whine that the game is too hard without 5 stars when people can and have actually do all the quest until now with lower rarity servants only. You just need to be smart with your team. The game needs time and patience to get the most out of it, months until ready. Glhf!",positive
"Amazing gacha game. But you have to know two things going in. 1) The gacha is -brutal- if youre going for rare characters, but most characters are usable in all content with enough elbow grease with but a few exceptions. 2) The game's story is very VERY boring early on and doesnt really get good until the America singularity. This is enough to understandably turn some people away. If you can get past this, FGO is one of the best gacha games on the market.",negative
Horrible customer service department. They are unwilling to help. The roll rate is so low and just a cash grab. Steer clear and if you dont hope you dont run into any issues or mistakes because they surely would not try and resolve the issues. I have been playing for years and spent money ont his game yet they do not seem to care at all about your experience.,negative
The game itself is great...collecting servants and a great storyline( although I skip some of its part *alright most of its part*) It is one of the games that no need to pay to have a great time.,positive

And when I tried to get my old account back through their ""support"" no one had enough care to actually try.

"An older gacha game for sure, but the mechanics are solid, you can do endgame with F2P units and the writing, OST, and story are awesome!",positive
"First off, love the game and the series. One of those, simple to learn, difficult to master kind of deals, complete with the love-hate relationship that is gacha. But, there is something that has happened to this game that's upsetting. Been playing for a year now, and the issue has repeatedly tempted me to uninstall, and that's performance issues. The system upgrade patches throughout the year have made the game run progressively worse on my tablet. I hope it can be remedied.",negative
This is hell you're walking into. But this is the gatcha hell I love... The amount of husbando I get is üëå you can even brag F2P BTW.,positive

0.7 percent drop rate lmao,positive
"Incredible story, lovable characters, and amazing character designs. The gameplay is simple on a surface level but can get a lot more difficult the more you get to know the game. Gacha is complete hell but that is what makes the experience of getting an SSR more valuable than any other gacha games out there. Definitely should have some fate knowledge to get a good grasp of what this game really is.",positive

"If you love Fate franchise this is a Go to Game for you. No rush on progress. No auto play(Well we could use one for auto grinding), but for the most part best gacha game i played. It is hard to get your waifu though.",positive
"I would give this five stars, but the gacha aspect of this is heavily weighted towards making you pay by inflating the pulls with craft essences. These, while helpful and necessary(only for a select few CE), exist mostly to prevent you from getting more higher level servants. The gameplay is fun, the characters are great as well as the animations, but the gacha aspect feels unfair a lot of the time compared to similar games.",positive
Everything's good!,positive
"Been playing since release and feel like leaving a review. Have been enjoying the game. Pretty much get every character I want when I save for them, got pretty much one 5 star for every class. UMU~ nero is best btw second is tomoe, tomoe needs more love gamer oni lovers rise up lol. A fun turnbase game with pretty good animations then pretty much every anime fan will most likely play once in thier life",positive
"FGO received an optimization update that made the game run 100% better. No longer am I spending more time waiting for quests to load than actually playing. The roster is nice, servants of all rarities are useful. The rates are still as trash as always. I have seen banners destroy ppl mentally for not getting anything after so much spent so buyer beware. Outside of that there's always some sort of even running to grind out. No pvp which is a plus in my book for balance.",positive

I just wish they add an auto function to not constantly keep playing and implement a system that allows us to do multiple runs at once like some others games. And increase the rates of getting a 5 star form 1% to 3% so players could have an easier time pulling for the character they want.,positive
It's a good game with lots to collect the odds of 5 servents maybe low but rarity ain't everything a good team with the right abillitys and class can overcome many of the tougher enamys,negative

"Apart from the 5* rates, I can only say... Umu! Yo wa tanoshii! This game is a quality VN disguised as a mobile gacha game. Apart from the first few singularities, the story picks up near the end of the first part and never lets up. The rates, as I mentioned, are undeniably atrocious. But it makes up for it by providing you ways to strengthen lower rarity servants as well as genuinely great free welfare 4* servants that can carry you just fine even all the way to the current endpoint.",positive

10/10 best game ever!!11!!!!!!1!!!1!!,positive
I freaking love this game the only complaints I have with the game so far is that it's too hard to get those special Wheels to summon a selected servant cuz you have to get fired of the same servant in order to get just one and it takes like 10 of these special Wheels to get one and sometimes it seems like the game updates like a few time a week. gets kind of annoying having to keep updating the game in order to play I understand for events and everything and want to hear English voices in game.,positive

FGO is worth playing for the story and has enjoyable gameplay mechanics. It gets a bad rep because gacha but honestly it is very forgiving in how readily it gives out SQ and summon tickets for free as well as welfare servants. I absolutely love FGO as a diehard Fate fan. Just don't sink thousands on non-GSSR banners and you'll be fine,positive
"Addicted and I hate it. Honestly though fun stories, exciting gacha and characters to suit anyone's style",positive

Fgo is having a Problem again where I somehow cannot connect to the server and its really irritating because I have Reinstalled the game 3 times and I have been trying to make it work for the last 5 hours Other than some few errors which cannot be dealt with in a blink of an eye the game is Fun and the story is also good both main and event stories.,negative
"Grand Order is the compilation story about heroes from various era and places. Be it good or evil ones, this is the story where they come together in order to prevent incineration of humanity. While the gacha rate is bad, even lower rarity and free Servants can be as strong as SSR ones if you max (and Grail) them. The power balance is certainly maintained, almost no Servants are too strong or too weak. It's all about how you use them. You will enjoy this game as long as you are not too greedy.",positive
"Gacha rates are miserable, the developer is stingy, app can be laggy at spots so why so high? Game is designed such that there are many totally valid approaches while even ""outdated"" servants and ces have their place. Even the low rarity ones can potentially have special tricks that higher rarities can't reproduce with better numbers. Story starts of questionable but gets much better starting in Camelot.",negative
Good luck,positive
"I love this game. The story, the soundtrack, the gameplay is all worth the grind. The grind however, is the 99% of the game, so would not recommend to people who don't like grinding or have other more important things to do aside from sitting all day at home tapping buttons on your phone. Aside from that 10/10 best game I've ever played.",positive

"One of the best f2p gachas tbh, it's got a great story line and very unique when I compare this to the other fate games; where the MC competes with other master-servant pairs. This one doesn't pit you against anyone, sure you'd go up against servants just like in the other fate games, but here you're also against Solomon's demons (read: which btw really exists) and not only that you could team up with the servants tied to the singularity or lost belt episode you're in.",positive

best gacha game ever,positive

New update makes the loading times so much better! Though it tends to freeze up sometimes...,positive
Thank you,positive
"If you're a fan of the Fate series, this game is a must play. The story creates a massive lore which would take you on a fun ride. Although this game can be repetitive, tedious, and sometimes gives unforgiving gacha rolls, it still picks up as one of the best rpg games I've ever played.",positive

"I'll change my rating if the issue is solved. I have been playing for almost a month and whenever the event is coming to an end the game just keeps lagging and crashing. There has been no updates of maintinance and whatnot but it really is displeasuring to play a game that is supposed to be at 11 million downloads to have this kind of issue. I mean seriously, it's annoying. My data connection is great and I can even steam HD YT videos with ease but with this game, Ugh! Please fix the issue.",positive

"This is a rip off of about 30 other games. Slow excessive dialog, painfully bland combat, and the sheer cost to spend is ridiculous. This game should have been more hack and slash or at least less slow paced jrpg. Being this coming from the fate anime series i expected more and better and tbh using the noble phantasm for and character is a total, total disappointment. Skip this and make them do it right",negative

great game but rates,positive
"a mobile game with a fantastic story writing and amazing soundtrack. if you play only for the gameplay, you'll probably will get bored real fast, also this game is one of the worst gacha rate below 1% for ssr, not the worst but one of them.",positive
They should add a way to merge accounts,neutral
"Great anime series, game is definitely a wallet gouger. Save your money as the drop rates are extremely horrible. 30 tickets and 90 SQ and not a single banner drop. Fire Emblem Heroes is much better, more to do and no lopsided battles or special attack spammage etc. 2 stars because of the anime otherwise it would be zero stars.",positive

I have been experiencing such High Internet Usage while just playing this game for only less than 40minutes.. with this I might consider quiting the game.. please fix it, it's a great game I did enjoy my game.. my.time.i waste for the game is totally worth it but somehow the game use a lot of net.",positive
Good but VERY p2w,positive
"Game is actually good, all gacha games are grindy - that's nothing new. Rates are so-so. The gameplay and storyline are constantly improving in terms of writing, especially on the new events and main story. You'll love some of your servants based from their interaction and interludes. The support system are also really responsive when you lose your account, I accidentally lost mine and got it restored under 3 days. I'm really thankful for that!",positive
This game's story one of the best or the best story ive seen in a mobile game.The gacha rates are pretty low but it is what it is.This game got me into the anime and i love it.The battle system is easy to learn and is addicting to make you play the game more.The Noble Phantasm animations are also top tier. One of the best gachas i have ever played 10/10.,positive
Wow! unbelievable! this game won't give u anything for downloading and playing the game for the first time... other gacha games will give u free currency to summon on their banners but this game won't give u anything .. really bad for new players I really cant believe it... no gifts nothing... dont even bother until they fix it,negative
Fun at first and as you progress in the game but later you soon realize that your never gonna summon a 4 star or higher SR .,positive
Nice game and still need to fix some server connection problems,neutral
It was somewhat interesting. The amount of chances of getting a 5 star servant is slim. The fact that some of em are somewhat overpowering to other servants.,positive
"The garbage rates fuel my gambling addiction and I've lost track of time, my soul has left my body and my body has become an unlimited gacha whale. And I've lost my family. Overall it's a fun game, perfect for the family, even more for a gambler 5 stars",positive
I got too many salts,neutral
"Best played on an emulator like BlueStacks, otherwise you'll lag out like no tommorow. On a standard phone, it's a 3-star due to the lag, but once it's on stronger hardware like BlueStacks it runs fine and is 4-star instead.",positive
Good anime game for Fate fans,positive
"gatcha game, kinda fun but the game is very slow. 10+ minutes to do a turn based game?",positive
"The best story out of any game I have ever played, can be played for free by using only low rarity servants. The gacha rates are horrendous though at 0.5% for a 5 star ssr. Takes around 1000 to 1500 saint quartz to get 1 5 star.",positive

Not to far in but fun,positive
"Free to play is good, waifus are the best.",positive
Good game I enjoy it a lot,positive
"You don't run into many gacha games with stories and characters you actually care about like this one. The gameplay is simple and straightforward, yet it's still fun. Even just grinding for embers can be fun. It's a very addictive game with lots of personality.",positive
Picked up the game again. Good game.,positive
Just wish the screen size can support bigger phones,positive
"I love this game, however Im wondering if any other android users are having issues with the connection? It says cant connect to server???",positive
Updated I had to uninstall the game. Hope I don't lose all the work I have done. Because it wouldn't work.,positive
"Great gameplay, easy to learn mechanics with some degree of tactics to be learned. Frequent seasonal events to spice up the otherwise stellar story (that also gets updated every so often), that also get repeated for those who miss them the first time. Good luck catching them all, the roll rate for the best servants is....low. I pray for your willpower and checking account.",positive
Great game. Played it a few times. But now I'm having trouble. I've restarted it about 15 times now to get a new main character but all it gives me is a berserker. Thats fine for the beginning but not later on. Any tips help.,positive
"They did some update recently and the game lags like crazy, takes 30 minutes for 1 animation to complete and repeatedly crashs, I reported this so many times but these guys haven't done anything about it, a shameless cash grab the only good thing is the story and the cast of characters",neutral
"The story's not hooky, the characters are okay, but when I tell the game that I can read/speak English, the characters speak Japanese in battle, with no subtitles. Other than that, they don't speak at all, and you just read the words they say. Also, so far, there's lots of strong women. Are there any good men in the game? Geez! Also, it gets VERY laggy, and sometimes the game doesn't respond when I tap. I'm sorry, but I'm uninstalling.",positive

Best Waifu in the game and also best story for a gacha game but worst rate up ever,negative
"Great gameplay, superb storyline, interesting events and lots of gacha waifus. There is no pvp on this game which makes it F2P friendly. Every characters/servants have their unique set of skills which makes even the low level servants very useful! However, this game has one of the worst gacha system, mixing of characters and non characters scouts into one gacha system while having super low scout rates of high level servants. This game is also super grindy; be it leveling or farming items.",positive
I simply live with the pain.,negative
Best rate ups ever,positive
"I like the game, it's so fun!",positive
"Love it, all my favorite servants back for more as i grind through hell. definitely not for everyone, im already lost and hooked so i can't get out, but if you like fate you'll more than likely love this if you don't not so much.",positive
"Great story but overall usability, value for money and game modes need improvement",positive
gameplay wise: epic gacha wise: still epic but its gonna give u a lot of salt,positive
"Wonderful game overall. The animations are clean, especially considering the volume of characters (with more being added almost monthly), the strategy and story is all there. But unless you've got a bunch of time to kill grinding for leveling and ascension, I wouldn't recommend it. Plus, I'm legally required to mention that the gacha rate is horrendous. Don't bother going for the SSRs (5 stars) unless your wallet is feeling too full. Not worth it 99% of the time",negative
It cool,positive
"The story is very meh, its not very free to play friendly, and it takes FOREVER to get enough of the premium currency to actually sommun for more units. Even when you do have enough you're more than likely not gonna get anything good because the chances of getting higher rarity characters are slim to none.",positive
YOU ONLY CAME FOR WAIFUS DON'T LIE TO ME,neutral
"Good story, gacha is hell",negative
It's cool and nice it's like playing final fantasy,positive
"Well, it's a good game my only problem is your gacha systme plus the freaking quartz. It's too expensive like the cheapest can't even let you roll 10x. Also, rate up is a lie. Japan server's rate up is actually ok than NA.",positive
"Dont get too cocky just because i rate you five stars, Mongrel. Consider this acknowledgement from the King of Heroes",positive

"Probably the best in terms of depth, development and the amount of content gacha out there. Also, unlike many other games in a similar genre, 2, 3 and 4 star servants are actually playable and can carry you through any event or story stage. The only reason you NEED to roll for a 5 star servant is either them being game-breaking (only a couple of servants are like that) or waifu reasons. So yeah, gacha is not that bad and you get a ton of summoning currency from the story.",positive
"This Game ia Top Notch for Fate Freaks out there, 5 star over all, but all i can ask Is that Make Noble Phantasm scenes more dramatic,, So is the Fight scene. thats all THANK YOU FOR THE BEST GAME, YOU all Created..",positive

Great app and great anime. Would recommend playing this,positive
"If you want a game that is entertaining with a great story that exists in the fate universe this is it. The game has a full thoughtout story and great game mechanics. The gatcha is rng, so anything can and will happen depending on your luck. some of my friends have ""EX' luck and get 5 stars like candy and others...not so much. It's totally free to play, you can beat the game without spending a dime and have fun while doing it. Save for what you want,the game gives plenty of quartz if you play.",positive

My favotite most played game!,positive
I've been playing this game since cualter originally dropped and I've loved the game ever since but a complaint I've always had was the summon rates and the excessive farming they need to add some type of way to farm faster like Bleach Brave souls or Grand Cross,positive
I love danganronpa,positive
"Good game, updates very often",positive
Rich story,positive
"Incredibly unfun game, where gameplay revolves around repeatedly grinding materials forever. But, the story and characters are some of the most interesting you'll see in the platform. Played since launch and I hope to see the story to its completion.",positive

SUPER ADDICTIVE AND FUN,positive
pretty fun and a great time killer though since it's a gacha based game bad luck can be quite rough and if you're a f2p even worse. And if both like your's truly it is actual hell if hell was fun. Update: It's not fun I have no idea why I still play it after all this time. Probably because of Antonio.,negative

"Gacha sucks, everything else is top tier",negative
"Good but character draws suck, you get the same person 12 times in a row.",negative
"It has a great story and the gameplay is fun. The gacha rates are low, but you can do really well in the with just the low rarity servants. High rarity servants are really good but they are not necessarily for any part of the story, unlike for other gacha games that make it impossible to play without high rarity characters. The only bad thing is that the game is kind of a grindy mess, but the story makes up for it.",positive
Fate grand order is great story with memorable characters! Only thing that everyone needs to be warned about is the gacha....,positive
"Gameplay is easy to understand with subtle mechanics that you can learn to get better. The story is especially enjoyable, with tons of fun characters. The gacha is pretty unforgiving, but totally optional in terms of gameplay.",positive

The game's story is absolutely beautiful, and the experience is unparalleled. F/GO's art is beautiful; whether it's the characters or the CGs. The servant system is extremely rewarding. When leveling up servants, the player has to work hard in order to make their servants stronger. Overall, Fate/Grand Order is an astonishing experience.",positive

"If you want a turn based RPG with fate characters, you've come to the right place. The joke is ""Fate/grind order"" and, having played this game for a while, I can say for certain that it does hold some truth. However, DW has been really good as of late to implement UI and quality of life updates from JP early into NA, as well as getting animation updates out in a expedited manner. I would recommend this game to any person who enjoys the fate series. Just be sure to save for people you like.",positive
I absolutely love this game the only thing I wish was changed is the SSR servant drop rate so getting limited servants were easier but other than that I love it good stories and game play in my opinion,positive

The the first 8 (or more) hours are terrible. It's like the developers wanted people to stop playing. There is nothing to get you to keep playing. This last event shows the developers do not care about your time. You might like it if you have a lot of time and money but it's just terrible. This game feels about as good as shoving a fork under your nail.,negative
Terrible,negative
"For the amount of unneccessary grinding in this game, it lacks an Auto Battle System that would make its grinding ""plausible"". Dont reccomend it unless you want to spend whole days replaying the same stupid battle by hand. If they add Auto-battle then it ""might"" be worth it. But as it is, its terribly unfun.",negative
Solid story and gameplay,positive
If your a free player no way your get a five star character Because I watched this video about this gotcha and if you get A four star not character card you will not get a four star or Five star character card for a ten roll so there's vary little Chance to get anything unless you have a lot money Because if anything your a free to player like me you Can be vary lucky sometimes but that's like every a hundred times you roll a single roll so don't expect this game to show you any Mercy,positive
Its a good game but it sometimes says not available in your country,positive
"Amazing game , best mobile game ever",positive
I wish they make an offline version since I only play when there's no internet.,positive
"I'm a fan of fate series and everything is good about the content of this game. However, the gacha literally sucks! Imagine saving too many sqs, like thousands of them and got nothing but trash ce's and too much bronze servants. I've been playing this game for 6 months and it is my third acc but I never got to have the taste of any 5 ssr servants. Having lower ranked servants is also useful but there's always been a huge gap between playing with 5 ssr's and 4 - 3 ssr's.",positive
- Good story telling. - Good graphic overall quality. - Gacha rate is lower than avg gacha games but quit accurated (1 ssr per 100 role). - Balanced game which many 1~3‚òÜ have a good potential to use even you have ssr(5‚òÜ).,positive

Terrifying drain on wallet if you lack self-control. I'm doomed. This is hell you're walking into. Getting a win in gacha feels better than winning cash. Game is pretty fun tho and the story is great. Proceed with caution. Liking Fate helps.,positive

"Grinding to get 1000000 points isnt as fun as you think. I tried to complete the story to get the new Jeane Alter and found out that I had to grind alot of points in order to get her. Its not worth it sadly and while the game is okay, it wears out its welcome after playing it a couple of times. Best go with Chain Chronicles or Sin of Alice instead. They are much funner.",positive

"This game would've died eons ago if it did not have the Fate franchise's name value. Absolutely horried gacha rates with no ceiling system (advertised as 5% SSR but actually 4% of that aren't characters), and more than 90% of the character roster is ""limited."" Gameplay gets extremely repetitive and boring, and grinding outside of event is inefficient and mostly unrewarding despite being a hassle due to absolutely zero automated systems. Lastly, it has an endless power creep history (continuing).",negative

As a Fate game it's good. As a mobile game you can very easily beat all the content without spending any money. When your spend money on this game is when it gets bad.

Really good gacha hell game. The rate of getting a ssr servant is really low but that's the base of any rng games. There are plenty of 1-3 star servant that are really good. Anyway don't bother taking the reactions of those who give low rating to this game cause most of the time there just salty from the gacha. This game is not a pay 2 win its more of a grind to win game.,positive
Used to work fine with my home internet but lately I had to use my mobile data just to play this since it refuses to connect with my wifi,positive

"Terrible gacha rates (1% 5*). No pity mechanics when summoning for limited 5* units. Gameplay is decent but many stages soon become mandatory to get meta units (Jalter, Merlin, etc.). Material drop rates are abysmal. Events are fun/comedic most of the time. No autobattle. No beginner's rewards. No communication between devs and the playerbase. Decent story. Good characters. Great waifu art. F/GO is like Beats headsets. Only popular because of the brand name but content is pretty lackluster.",positive

"Ridiculously slow. It takes almost 30 hours of continuous play before you can grind enough premium currently for a summon, the battle system is mediocre and needlessly tedious, there's no auto battle, so you have to devote all of your attention to picking actions each turn, and one round of battle often takes at least 3 or 4 turns, the gacha rates are heartbreakingly low for how little you get to roll, the story is interesting, but it's not worth sitting through 10 minutes of monotonous gameplay",negative

"If you like min-maxing, resource management, and building the perfect team, this is a great strategy game to pick up. Many of the best utility servants are low-rarity and the Support mechanic allows you to make use of others' high-tier servants. The story gets really good around Singularity 6, and the events are lucrative as well. The only big issues are the high amount of time-locked content and unforgiving gacha, so the game does need some more bonuses for newer masters to not miss events.",positive

Excellent storytelling, if a tad predictable, seemingly simple but actually complex and cerebral combat, rewarding gatcha system, etc. Couldn't recommend more! After completing the story, I only wish I could give the game 6 stars!

Everything about the game is good except the gacha and grinding.",positive

I like this game Gilgamesh e√±uma elish!!!!!,positive
"I adore this series and this game. I love the character designs, story, and the fact that it takes months to reach a point in the game where you might feel even a little bit pressured to spend any money to have a chance at continuing the game. There's always new content coming out, and it's just a good time. But recently I had to change devices and while I have the transfer code, I don't have the password for my account. There is no way to recover it? Kinda spoils game play when I can't playüò≠",positive
"The game is all around great, and I love the Fate series. One issue that seems to recently sprung up for me is when SummerFes was introduced, the game seems to freeze up randomly time to time. It would be nice for this to be fix, as it is rather annoying to have to restart the game whenever it does.",positive
Awesome ^^,positive
Listing the things I love about this game and trying to watch the series in chronological order fall into the same boat that being I don't even know where to start this game is a masterpiece thx,positive
Very fun and addicting. You can also collect your favorite servants from Fate/Stay night and some new ones (if your lucky enough to roll them in the gacha),positive
The rates on this game are horrible to get characters 5‚òÜservant 1% 4‚òÜservant 3% and 3‚òÜservant 40%. I still enjoy the game and love the fate series.,positive

"One of if not my favorite mobile game. You don't need to know anything about the other Fate/ series to enjoy the game though knowing of them adds to the experience. My only problem is that the gacha(draw) system has kind of a ridiculously bad draw chance for the five star characters, though lately I've had really great luck for the last three event gacha draws at this point in time so I don't know if that means anything or not.",positive
why i can't update my Fgo and i didn't even get my transfer code please helpüò£,positive
It's a good game Though I had found out I think I have c or d ranked luck because I get mostly 1 star or sometimes 2 or 3 stars on servants and mostly craftessences I'm still playing the game though. Update now I think I have b+ rank or a ranked luck most of the sr and ssr servants are divine or 5 star after one roll and ticket pull.,positive
"The game is... Okay. Visually, it's beautiful. The gameplay is okay. The story is okay. The gacha rates are absolutely horrific and the premium currency is costly. The free currency is relatively hard to come by as well. Hesitant recommendation to Fate fans, everyone else should probably steer clear.",positive
"A gacha game like any other. It has a good story and characters, but it also has terrible rates. Honestly, I love this game but they need to implement some sort of pity system.",positive

"It needs an automatic battle button, because is kind annoying only defeat minions also incrase banners rates even more.",negative
"Its a fate gacha game, good luck getting your wifus and may the gotcha gods be ever in your favor.",positive
"The game overall is fun and has a driving story. Team building is fun although difficult when you're new. You also do need to grind a bit for ascension mats and during events. Now the gacha is a matter of probability. You have a 3% chance to get a 4 star servant and a 1% chance to get a 5%. Now it can be utter hell, virtual rolling without success after a lot of summons, then rolling in the actual game can help as you're bound to hit the 1% chance eventually.",positive
Gameplay is fun but rng for servant pulls is some of the worst ones out there.,negative
Hey thats hell you're walking into,negative

"While FGO is a gacha game with ridiculously low drop rates, it's in no way pay to win. You can clear most all events and the stort with 1-3 star servants, so you don't really need to blow all that much money, just time for that grind. The art and music are pretty nice, and the Fate waifus are great. Story's surprisingly decent as well.",positive

As being f2p, the only way I get sq is through log ins, not if you whale. How the hell am I suppose to rack sq when I already cleared all free quests? Heres a suggestion, make a dungeon you can clear everyday, for only 1 sq, but it can only be done once per day, but what are the chances of them reading this.",positive
Fun game with a solid story.,positive
This is a good game and it has a grate story line I would recommend anyone who is in to this to play u will love it,positive

"Been a fan of the Fate series for years, knew about Grand Order but was super excited when I found out that it had been ported to the US. Excellent game, my only complaint is about the lottery-styled gacha that determines whether or not you can get your favorite servants. Edit, two years later Still playing, love the game and the story onle gets better. I understand the need for the Gacha, no Gacha, no funding, no game. Altogether- worth the investment, in my own opinion",positive
Cuz why not,neutral

"I have minor problem. You know how on the top right corner of the screen where the game shows you the amount of mats and qp and embers and stuff you get? Well clicking that button only shows you the amount of materials you have, AND ONLY MATS. I WANNA KNOW HOW MANY EMBERS I HAVE! I know this is pretty nitpicky, and it is. So far the game is great, but they seem to add handy features later, like the cancel comand card button near the bottom right corner. So far, a great game i recomend to all.",positive

The game has good OST and gameplay but it's a miserable excuse in the terms of gacha. The rates for a SSR is pitiful. A measly 1% and that's not counting the excessive number of Craft Essences that'll constantly leave you with dead multis. If you can't handle saving for months and getting thrashed then you should quit. If you wanna win pay a lot of money. Simply put. Gameplay? Good. Grinding? Neverending. Music? Good. Summoning For Units? A joke compared to other game like Dokkan.,positive

Update. Today is 8/3/20 I am still playing this game to this day. With its updates finally catching up with JP, it's only gotten better. The gancha still hurts. Even took $500 to get 1 of Ereshkigal. But I have my cinnamon bun home. The game IS F2P friendly if you do go that route.",positive
"Gameplay is very repetitive and very grindy, UI is outdated compared to other games, but they hit you with non stop events and for some reason you seem to just cant stop playing after a while, the gacha rates can be turbo trash, but if you research a bit about all the low rarity units in the game, the game can be beaten with just 1~3* servants. Pretty fun",positive
"Yeah, I'm lucky",positive
"Story is mediocre at first and gradually gets better. Team building is crucial in the later stages of the game. Low rarity servants are useable late game. The gacha rate is low even with rate up as a factor. Grinding for leveling materials varies by servant, but is still grindy. Events are fun, but really grindy without certain in-game items that are obtained through the gacha. Needs a better variety of music.",positive

But as said the gameplay is rather so and so. It requires large amounts of grinding, patience and luck. Even if you dont have a good team, the community will help out with their support. Unfortunately as you continue, you really need your own good team with the rates as they are? Good luck. Overall though good enough for me.",positive

"Story: Kinda rough in the start but gets better once you reach the sixth chapter. The story gets good from there. Events: Usually worth giving a read your first go-around, as its usually pretty funny. Best time to get good materials for strengthening Gameplay: Simple to learn, intermediate to master. For mobile its okay, you select cards, characters have 3 skills, and you have 3, also. Gacha: Low chance for 5stars even on rate up, my advice is dont impulse roll for just anyone- save for the best",positive
I have been trying to recover my account for two weeks by emailing back and forth with customer support. I will change it to 5 stars once I get access back to my old account.,positive
"It's okay, not very intricate( a standard of mobile games),its so heavy handed about microtransactions that the game overall sucks. Any good character is locked behind the gachapon system and they purposely make ""rolls"" as difficult to get as possible, so you will never really get the good characters without paying substantially. Furthermore, their posted odds are a straight lie. When they say 3% chance, they mean 3% of that tiers pool so a rare characters chances are less than .01% in actuality",positive

I've been reading the reviews for the game it's really funny how some complain that the game doesn't have an auto battle system and how the rate up is trash XD The funniest one is that they get salty because they couldn't get any ssr hahahhahahah I guess kotomine backstabbed them while they were rolling. I've seen people who have utilized low tier servants and even beat Goetia with a f2p line up I guess some people aren't really that smart. Also I beat Goetia with Astolfo one of the worst rider,negative

The cons: You have to manually grind everything, u need to farm exp cards, no pity system, and gameplay can get repetitive once u play a lot. I advise noone to play unless they want a job doing the same missions for 8hrs in an event to clear the shop. Overall good game and a solid 4 star.",positive

This game is a pay to win game. Leveling a servant up needs so much and at the start it's already really hard. Basically making yourself stronger takes such a long time even getting saint quarts takes a long time it usually takes 1+hours just to get 30 and to top it all of when you use that hard earned 30 saint quarts you get bad servants. To be honest I've heard so many people complain that this is a pay to win game. I've played so many gacha games and so far this one is the hardest like super.,positive
Humongous game with engaging lore and characters for every taste. Farming is a bit tedious but story quests are great.,positive

This game is to grindy for those who don't have that much time in the day bcus of family and work.

"If you're a fan of the FATE series then this is a great way of getting more of what you love. If you are a fan of gacha games, then this isn't the game for you. Rates are trash and the price for quartz (premium currency) is dummy high. Simply to learn gameplay, but difficult to master and there are so many strategies that can be created with different teams. Story starts off slow and would recommend skipping around if you aren't in the mood to read until the 6th chapter. Overall fun time :)",positive

I suggest that you add an ""auto-clear"" option after you have cleared a certain level. Cause most of the time, grinding for materials is taking too long.",positive
"The gacha is hell, but I knew that going in. The gameplay is not much to write home about, but it does it's job well. The story of Camelot onward is outright masterful.

Love the story and characters. Recent improvements have made game play better. The gacha is wacked compared to other gachas I have done; sometimes it drags you through whale hell and only 1 SSR servant to show and sometimes you that 1-2 free ticket luck. Expanding story keeps it going.,positive

"There are some obvious improvements this game could get, some of which are shown in the JP verision, and some of which are not, like a higher SSR Servant Pull Rate. Still, the story is great and the game play is fairly good. If I had to recommend any Gacha, it would be this one.",positive

Good game for fate fans. Don't know for new comers though. Good side is: I love the gameplay the story and the characters especially in lostbelt story. Even the crypters' own story was pretty good. Grindy for mats but atleast they're free. Not much p2w imo. F2p btw. Downside: 2 years worth of delayed content from the JP server. When you try to pull for your desired servants and didnt get them you feel broken. Story dont have voice overs(but acceptable). Dated graphics compared to newer games,positive

"Overall its not a bad game, however its pretty much agreed upon by many who play gacha games that this has one of the worst drop rates around (some games are worse but this is still pretty unbearable). Its not a bad game but due to low drop rates and infrequent summoning, you probably won't be getting anything of high rarity. Still playable otherwise but from a casual collector's perspective, I find it hard to recommend to people who aren't into the Fate series.",positive

The play style is pretty straightforward, and the graphics (especially the Noble Phantasms) are great! The Event giveaways really help those, like myself, get a jump on the rest of the game, early on. Having to pay (sometimes INSANE amounts) to get the BEST characters is irritating; but you can EASILY play this game without paying a nickle! HAPPY 3RD ANNIVERSARY FGO!!!",positive

The animation are great and the gameplay is easy to get into although it's pretty hard to build good team if you're new player. But this can be offset by the good 3-4 star choice that you can easily get. The bad side is only the gacha and the heavy grinding nature of the game.Overall it take a while to get into, but if you've already have a good team it will be enjoyable to play especially for F2P",positive

"good game. To be able to know more our servants I suggest to enable us players to see the description of active skills of the unavailable ones which requires ascension to just be able to see it.

Been playing this game for 2 years+ but one day out of no where my account got hacked and transferred to another device without my knowledge. Went to support to try to get it back. But they said they couldn't verify the circumstances or events that have transpired and they cannot provide further assistance. Also because since the account in question is active. They cannot verify my account ownership and take further actions despite sending them all my Google play store transactions id to them.,positive
"Amazing art, story, characters, soundtrack, and gameplay. Most of them feel way too good for a free to play mobile game. Like others say the gacha is punishing and soul crushing but they give you a good number of free quartz. Not enough to get every servant you want but you'll be able to get a few good SSR ones. And it makes those few times you get them feel amazing. This game can also be beaten without a single SSR if you know how to play it so it's not P2W.",positive

"Great for passing time while commuting to and from work. Story starts off with a pretty simple save-the-world premise but eventually ramps up into something more solid. Its great for returning fans of the franchise but also not bad for players entirely new to Fate. You can pretty much complete all content without paying too!

Endure the salt. Events can be very grindy. Material farming is a nightmare too.",positive

The daily pull is not from the standard pull (FP pool), but there are servants you could get from completing each singularity AND event stories. Its not P2W though, play smartly and you could finish the entire storyline using just 3 stars. My qualm is mat grinds though, the drop rate is just brutal at times unless ypu get to higher levels (looking at you Phoenix feathers). All in all, good waifu game.",negative

One of the more veteran friendly games out there. The game can be beaten on low rarity f2p units.

"This may sound crazy to some of you but this game is not at all pay to win. There is an option to buy things, however there is no possible way to use money to skip the grind to level up your characters. The game is also balanced around the F2P characters, so ultimately when you roll it isn't because the character is the best. You roll because you like that character, and you're paying for your waifus or husbandos, NOT for the best characters.",positive
"I've been playing Fate for over a year now and let me just say this is my favorite mobile game of all time the story is excellent and engaging, the character sprites look really good, the events are also fun,the characters are also all good in their own different ways, and the music is also great,while the Gacha system feels unfair sometimes this is still understandable since most Gacha/Gacha like games tend to have similar rate ups for example kof all star, dokkan battle, and arknights",positive
For new players be warned there will be a lot of catch up. Unfortunately the game is getting more and more to point of locking new players out of current event content if you do not have certain more recent chapters complete. You can still roll gatcha banners but thats it. The games item drop rates and event store item acquisitions are excruciatingly tedious for both (Best events in my opinion were first Halloween / Christmas). Sadly in many cases the game does not feel rewarding for the effort.,negative

"Excellent game overall. The SSR gatcha rate is low, but unlike other gatcha games, none of the units you get feel like filler, and often get upgrades to keep them relevant. Even the 1 star units can be built to be extremely powerful, and as much work is put into those Servants as SSR Servants. The main and event storylines are also well written, to the point where it feels at times more like a VN than a gatcha. Great music and voicework put it above all other games in the genre, in my opinion.",positive
"Great game all around, especially for Fate fans. I just really wish that we can link our accounts instead of having to use transfer codes. It'll be a 5 otherwise.",positive
"Its fate which is cool but the gameplay is sickeningly boring, and you can't even idle it since there's no auto battle. Like if you aren't gonna let people full idle like Azur Lane try and make gameplay kinda interesting like FeH. FGO just boils down to pushing the red button with Mr. Merlin. Its completely devoid of thought in the gameplay. I will never understand people that say it takes strategy. Its literally pick merlin and red button with a defensive character even on the hardest events.",positive

"The story is amazing for a gacha game and really immerses you with its visual novel style. You even grow to love characters whose designs maybe deterred you from developing them in your roster in the first place.

Another plus is that after a the first few chapters the game is basically a high quality VN. All in all, a very fun and enjoyable game when you're not salty or in material hell. Which is.. 95% of the time.",positive
Y is this game not available in other countries?,neutral
This game is free to play. And it is fun for the first few missions until it gets progressively more difficult. Some missions are impossible for me despite being higher than the recommended level. Not to say this game is garbage but the gacha pull rate is....I dunno rigged? I've played for a few months now & haven't pulled a Saber class until today because I paid for some quartz. And even then it was not a very good Saber servant. Refund me!! Rating this 1/5 is generous. Should have been 0/5.,positive
"Ok well I found out I have nearly 400 hours on this game which is a bit embarrassing considering I've always considered myself a casual. After playing many other gacha styles games, FGO is more generous and playable than most out there. You can get plenty free content and the gameplay stays interesting. I do play to get my favorite characters (i was a fate fan even before) and have spent money on this game. Also some of the singularities are VERY BORING, very anime writing and fanservice",positive

"Its all about the waifus... But there are still bugs that needs to be fixed like when the match started, all servants when casting their noble phantasms are not doing very well. They are not talking at ALL. But when they are hit, they talk even when selecting their skill they also talk. The only thing is that when using their noble phantasm they are not talking at all even the enemy. No subs too. HELP",positive
"When i was busy playing the game, at first it is playing very smoothly like my phone has 8 gb of ram so theres should be no problem playing this.. But a few hours later when my servants are using their noble phantasms, they are not saying or talking a single word at all even their subtitles are not there but when they are hit, they talk even when the game started or the match started they are all talking. Even the opponent or the enemy is not talking at all when doing their noble phantasms. Help",positive
It's alright I guess Edit 1 : 8/7/2020 well I certainly didnt think I'd stick around playing this game for so long. The gacha is a real pain in the ass because the game hands out quartz so few and far between so I'm stuck saving for months on end to roll a specific servant I want. There's a 2 year gap between the jp version and na version but that lets me plan out better on what servants i really want so thats good I guess. The salt from gacha aside I love everything else about this game.,positive

Good game the gem and summoning is kinda scummy the only way to summon on the anniversary banners is to buy gems gems earned by free to play won't let you summon with that,positive
I will say it is a very fun game with an amazing story line. Also the graphics and events are really fun. Though I do feel like there isn't enough events for newer players.,positive
The best game ever.im looking forward to more updates on this game,positive
10/10 would sell my house for a .jpeg again,neutral
"Game is very pretty, has many likeable characters, and cool strategic options. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that many events are completely un-fun, and the gacha rates are terrible.",positive
If your a fate fan this game is awesome!,positive
I've played this game for almost 2 years and just lost everything. Somehow my game got reset and lost all my progress. No way to recover it üò´. Will no longer be playing this game.,negative
"Hmmmm, loading times aren't sluggish anymore, the game is impressing me more than usual üëåüèª",positive
I hate this game. 5 stars!,negative
It's fun but it gets boring once you play for a little longer.,positive
The worst mobile game surviving by piggybacking on franchise,negative
"As of updating to android 10, the game crashes opon opening, but before then, it was a quite enjoyable game",positive
"Edit: Turns out that the game doesn't like USB Debugging being on. Once I turned that off. It launched fine. It's pretty fun, however, it's very much a gacha in the sense that it encourages you to buy summons... I keep trying to download and play this game but the game won't open. First it was asking me to open it using PayPal or other unrelated apps. Now it is trying to launch but then crashing immediately. Someone fix this please.",positive
Love the game wish there were did more co-op function,positive
"I have enjoyed the game since the Japanese release fun game good graphics 
good story. Only gripes are translation based which can be summed up in the 
below statement. Had to actually burn my saber because I hated seeing the 
horrible translated name altria instead of the nearly universally accepted 
Artoria or arturia that has been more or less used for about 10 years now 
heck fate Extella had an official translation of the name and this game was 
like nah it's Altria. Altria isn't even a name i mean really it just sounds 
like a Pok√©mon. Other than the translation complaint though nice work 
bringing the game over. Take the previous comment as a partial joke it's 
just in my opinion a bad translation the game itself is great. Update:. The 
game is rolling out slower than many other countries versions and giving 
less compensation.",positive
The drop rate is a lie don't trust it,negative
Interesting combat system. Wish certin materials were a little more acsesable.,positive
Too many currencies and it just looks like a hyped up flash game. To create an event and divide the games main currency between paid and free is scummy you want people to invest time and money but then invalidate the time invested by doing that. if this game really makes billions you earn nothing favorable by doing this.,positive
"Definitely for Fate-fans though i don't think people new in the series will understand the whole story without having a knowledge to the series, the game is fun! (and definitely gacha) fun...",positive
The best because been a Fate fan for a long time and love the story and events,positive
I love the game but the RNG man. 960 SQ and 50 tickets. Not a single 5 star servant.,positive
Perfect üòå,positive
"Have been playing for almost 3 years,I can say that the game is really worth the time, with a fantastic story, loveable characters and pretty amazing fan services atleast for a mobile game .The gacha salt can be straight up cruel as hell sometimes but it's really satisfy when you got the servant you really want . Furthermore, the developers are really doing their best to keep the game going . In the end it's totally worth your time if you really love spend your money on gambling :>",positive
Thank you for the upgrade! So much faster now ‚ù§Ô∏è I love this world & game !,positive
"It's a sure five star for me but dear developers, there is a bug in the new event that was released about the giant girl(Buyuan I think? No that's wrong but that event) upon reaching a certain section 3 of the last quest line. My game just freezes and I waited for a while but it didn't work. Can you do anything about it?",positive
"Dear developers of fate:go, Despite the story being FANTASTIC and the gameplay better than your autobattle farming, the big elephant is summon rates on banners. For example i pulled using 300 saint quarts and had only recieved 4* and 5* craft essences. I bring this up as the summon rate for servant to craft essence ratio is thrown off. 5* and 4* servants have a 1/4 ratio with 1* having a 1% total and 4* being 3%. An easy fix to the imbalance is guarantee a 4*+ servant for 10 pull plz fix this!!!",positive
This game is amazing by far one of the best mobile games I have rating 5 stars because it deserves it but my one complaint is the summon rates I wish they were higher but other than that I am quite satisfied with this game.,positive
"I am a returning player, and the gacha system is A TOTAL SCAM 400 quartz all CE and get servant that not even in a banner? Not gonna bother anymore",negative
"The devs helped me recover the data I lost within a few days... Awesome support... Fun game, even if you've never seen the anime like me.",positive
Good game but if I do go in expecting to get the hero you want this game is completely rng on characters even if you pay,positive
"Great characters, good combat, not pay to win. Game has recently got a new engine which has improved the load times and overall performance",positive
The grind is real.,neutral
Too many lolis. Gacha system is garbage compared to other games. If you're unlucky you could spend $1000 and never get a rare character. Other games at least have better odds or will give you a pity character after a number of pulls.,positive
Best game. Ever.,positive
"rate up is a lie, you're only going to play this game to get your waifus , it has an okay storyline, and you'll never get what you want unless you pay for it, the mechanics are pretty solid though",positive
Addicted to incridible story that is on par with visual novel and all chracter from 1 to 5 star is viable. There is no useless character on this game.,positive
keep the good job,positive
It's a nice game to play.,positive
aside from the nasty gacha rate its a good game (probably),negative

"Amazing story, have lots of fun with this game",positive
This game has the best story out of all gacha games I've played!,positive
Idk good,positive
"I did not spend a thing in the game but I was still able to get through all of those challenge quests. This game definitely deserves a 5 star! Though I admit that the gacha may be cruel for others, you can more or less win every quests with any Servants that you like. The meta Servants may be much better than others but keep in mind that the meta is not really the important factor in going through the game. Play with the Servants that you like and you are good to go.",positive
Loving this game just wish it was easier to get certain heroes,positive
"one of the best mobile games ive played story wise. mechanically wise, it brings new kind of rpg system for me and its just nice. The gacha is plainly hell, however each servants have their own uses, which makes it great for poor players like me.",positive
I hope the game will catch up to the Japanese version. The events are nice because of the welfare servants and materials. The story is nice too.,positive
"It's going to be fun for any fans of the Fate series. The characters are larger than life and the storylines are both humorous and intense equally. The only complaint from me is very common for these games. The good rewards and best gatchas are hard to get. It can be frustrating to save up the necessary currency to attempt a good draw but too often the result is less than hoped for. Usually, unless you spend real money, you might only get one or two full ten item draws in each story.",positive
"Difficult for those who want to rush through the game. Very good game for playing over the course of a year, for free. Prepare for the grind!",positive
"Most awesome,wonderful and amazing, but I ended up with no servant support for defense and buff to progress.",positive
I've wasted more than $5000 on this game. Probably would do it again tbh..,negative
Been able to play it now and am enjoying the life along with it's story.,positive
"I was really enjoying this game. The story is awesome and I enjoy all of the Fate series in general, but when I installed the most recent update, the app kept crashing. I sent an error report, but there was no response. I completely uninstalled the app and reinstalled it with no results. I hope eventually I will be able to continue playing this game. It is a great mobile game as long as it works on your phone. Update: I fixed it! Had to turn off usb defrag. Apparently it's an android thing.",positive

The rates are a scam!!!,negative
It's fine I guess if you like the fate story and stuff but if you're looking to get ANYTHING good from the gacha then I advise those without a lot of disposable income to search elsewhere. The chance of getting anything 5 star is so incredibly low and made worse by craft essence bull.,neutral
Great game and the matnence is worth it,positive
Great game the story gets good at chapter 6,positive
That's (gacha) Hell you're walking into.,negative

One of thr best gacha games <3,positive
"Needs more engaging, in combat mechanics. The grind doesn't have to be painful.",negative
"After three years, I have enjoyed playing the game. The events have been fun, along with a lot of content and updates to mirror the Japanese version. The only takeaway is that the free to play rolls are hard to net SSR characters as the chances are slim, even by Gatcha games standards.",positive
Extremely hard to get 5 stars without the usage of money.,negative
If you're a fan of fate it's pretty nice. It would have been 5 stars if not for the hell that is the gacha.,positive
If only the drop rate of 5 stars were higher üò©,negative
"Fun and while annoying it is possible to play/progress as a free player. The story is very good (despite some very stupid plot holes and moments, discounting genuine comedic stories). I like the Visual Novel aspect of this story the most but gameplay isn't bad either.",positive
Good game it's f2p friendly,positive
Get me outta this gacha Hell,negative
It's decent at best. Drop rates are piss poor but for a gacha game I suppose it is to be expected. Don't waste your money buying saint quartz it is just a waste,negative

Love the mythology behind every character and interactions between each of them also doesn't really Express pay to win so that's another plus I wished I got on sooner but I hope I get gilgamesh soon keep up the good work,positive
Get me out of here,neutral
Its fgo. The grand daddy of gachas. Leave your salt about not getting your waifu aside for a sec and appreciate the great storytelling which is such a rarity in gachas nowadays,positive
It finally worked for me,neutral
Great game for casual players like me. Doesn't require much time when you get the hang of it. The gacha is salty but you can still complete quests without the optimal/meta servants.,positive
Best game ever totaly love the game,positive
Gacha hell but it's so good,positive
"Needs to catch up with JP much more quickly Otherwise, 4 stars for gameplay and story",positive
"During the past 2 years, I've been playing FGO daily. As a f2p, gacha is not evil to me. Just save up for the waifu/husbando you want or if it's gameplay you want, then go ahead.

"Great gacha game with good storyline. I played for the gameplay, stayed for the waifus.",positive
"The game is wonderful, probably the most addicting game I played for me. The history and literature references are also educative, altho not the most accurate but it introduces me to new historical figures I never knew before. The graphics is so good. And the gameplay is just the best.",positive
"Amazing game with top tier waifus and solid classic turn based RPG gameplay. The story is very engaging, and the characters as compelling as they are coolly designed.",positive
They finally updated it and im satisfied.,positive
"It's a fun game if you like the fate series, excellent time killer .",positive
Best gacha ever (if ssr chanves are up :<),positive
"Don't let bad reviews that mainly just complain about the gacha rates dissuade you, the game is well worth anyone's investment, who loves a good story. Gacha in this game may be cruel at times, but you can beat any part of this game with almost any servants if you really want to. If you still really want to try the rarest servants, the many players (whales) like me are always willing to share them on our friends lists.",positive

This game is good but the art and animations did not age well.,negative
"This game has the best storyline over any other mobile games. I play it mainly for the plot and the characters. The gameplay requires you to plan ahead and think strategically in most challenge quests. The grind is not really hard and time-consuming compared to some other gacha games. However, the gacha RNG is abysmal and you will never have enough quartz to roll for your waifu. The silver lining is that you could learn to enjoy the little things and have fun getting unexpected SSR spooking you",positive
Sorry if I give only 1 star its because before you play this game you need to download the data on this game and require 700+ MB to download it plss fix it,positive
ive spent over 25 hours in this so far and i have no complaints the graphics are great it runs smooth and it plays fair,positive
One of the best gacha because it doesnt feel like you're pressured into spending or grinding and has great character development for servants of all rarities,positive
I Use To Love This Game But Sometimes There's a Problem with connection The Gacha Rate Up Is A Bit Dissapointing yet very exciting,positive

I'm here forever now,neutral
Eh it's ok yish,positive
"You honestly don't have to pay a single thing to play this game, and I may not be the most seasoned ""Master"" but I am happy with the number of Servants that I do have, and I have never paid a single thing. There is so much a F2P player can take advantage of like the daily ticket exchange, which gives an option of 1 out of 3 mats that would help anyone. Then there's the monthly Summoning tickets and the XP cards that you can get from the shop... So try to have fun I guess, it's not hard.",positive
I love it It has many of my favorite servants and good story to,positive

I'm Back Cause I Support Plushie,positive
"Fgo is one of the best gacha on the ""market"" they give out their gacha currency like oprah gives out cars. The animations are some of the best mobile games have to offer and the story and characters are really original and they are fantastic. Its pulling system is either hit or miss sometimes you waste 120 sq other times you get an SSR from a single pull. One last thing be prepared to grind all day and night in this game but trust me its worth it.",positive
Perfection,positive
Hope you guys fix the loading Issues cause it takes to much time to start the battle abd to open other commands,positive
"This company has done NOTHING to update this game into 2020. The loading screens will drive you MAD, the same mundane progression AND event grind from when the game was first released is STILL here, the gacha is still the worst I've EVER seen (hundreds of heroes that can ONLY be summoned on their specific banners on top of garbage rates), basic quality of life features are still missing, and the company didn't give players even ONE free multi for their ANNIVERSARY. So sad.",negative
Its very F2P Friendly the 3 stars though hard to get in the F2P gacha can easily beat the final boss people even make videos with low rairity servants beating hard bosses and yes these droprates can be a little cancerous lookin at you hearts of the forein god but that just means your patience will be more rewarding even the premium currency saint quarts can only get more shiny units that you will need to grind for more rare and exotic items that cannot be bought from some sort of shop,positive
Super fun and addicting game.,positive
I love it 10/10,positive
"Anyone who says that the game is pay to win is absolutely wrong. I never had trouble as a f2p player during both the campaign, farming and CQ's and if I did it was probably because I wasn't using the right team comp for the battle. The 1 to 3 stars are just as good and sometimes are alot better and are clear cut top tier in their respective roles. You won't always need a Waver or a Merlin to enjoy and play the game. All you need is brainpower and skill to utilize each servant to the fullest.",positive
It is vey fun to paly the game.,positive

"For people starting with FGO as their introduction for the Fate series,it can be confusing to them when compared to starting with the Fate/Stay Night LN.It is F2P with its lower rarity characters being better farmers/main DPS/Support compared to some of the higher rarity characters like Cu Chulainn and Mozart.The story can be deep and fascinating later on at the London singularity,but the first few singularities don't have that deep of a storyline.It gets difficult at camelot,but it can be beat.",positive

The best mobile game of all time.,positive
"Since the QOL update, this game is flawless. Runs perfectly now with no hangups. Totally smooth. One of the most popular gachas for a reason.",positive
"- Story is great. - Characters feel close thanks to their individual stories backing them up. - Gacha is cruel indeed, but I also feel immense enjoyment after pulling someone i want. - gameplay is soso(i personally enjoy it, especially like to see those big daddy crit numbers and doing those np loops). Overall I'll give it a solid 9/10 since i enjoy playing it so very much.",positive
"Awful game: no auto play, no new players reward, fighting animation is outdated, and main characters are weird/cheesy as hell (senpai). Don't bother with this game, there are so many better games out there.",negative
"The in-game mechanics and the combat system are phenomenal, my only dislike is that I cannot link my FGO game data to my account which means I have to resort to issuing transfer codes every single time I want to login on a different device. Beware of this because if you forgot to issue a newer transfer code and your phone breaks then you're basically screwed, you'll have to contact them with details about your account and it's not guaranteed that you will even get your account back.",negative
Great game if you can manage your resources,positive
V e r y n i c e.,neutral
"This by far is the only Gacha game that you will actually enjoy by the story and gameplay, however it gets a better context if you know your Nasuverse basics, and the gacha certainly could be a bit more forgiving, since High value servants are by far the hardest ones to obtain In all of Gacha Hells. Gameplay wise, is as basic as an RPG game can be, but certainly has a lot of mechanics that you learn along the way that makes the game more fun when you try more combinations.",positive

With the support system there is no need to have your own good units, fun free to play game just don't expect to get the character you want.",positive
Recently returned to the game. The game is great now. So many Qol updates. Recently they updated the platform to make the game go fast and smoothe without any lag. Fun casual game to play.,positive

Lord forbid the craft essence be something other than a duplicate.",positive

"As a 'totally' unbiased fate fan, I think this is one of the best gacha games out there. The story is pretty decent if you don't mind the first few singularities, which honestly are pretty bad. Fgo is also quite f2p friendly and you can clear everything with relative ease even with free units along with the friend support system. Been playing for a couple months now and I've been enjoying the game quite a lot and with the recent engine update the game got a whole lot better. 8/10",positive

Get rid of that p.o.s. selection support option(s.s.o.) b.s. just scrap the it all I hate it and always will even if it small portion just scrap it and to those who think oh that s.s.o idea is a good news flash it is not and it never well be to me it's like treating a fully capable of taking care of themselves 40 year old as 4 year old who know Jack squat and consently need supervising. My point is just give the new player the tutorial and then end it none this s.s.o. b.s.,positive
Too grindy.,neutral
"4th time reviewing this game. Summon rates are terrible. Having to constantly skip dozens of banners to save up enough sq to have a chance at getting a character I like is a living hell, it's not even remotely fun. Even as a daily player, you never get enough sq. All this game wants is your money. If you plan to be a f2p, STAY AWAY; this game doesn't care about the f2p fanbase and only wants money. I actually want to kill myself over this game sometimes. How pathetic is that?",negative

I also have one suggestion that I wish is added to the game, it is that you'd be able to give/send Saint Quartz to your friends, the limit would be 30 quartz each day, I'd like to add this feature so I can thank my friend and send him some quartz as my gratitude.",positive
"Been playing since launch and this game has improved so much over the years. From menu navigation to the battle system this game has made huge strides for a better experience. The story is accessable enough for new entrants into Fate, but has enough references for long time fans. Only thing preventing this game from being 5 stars is the abysmal gacha.",positive

"No other mobile game has ever had me so gripped in its story. There's just something unbelievably epic about saving humanity with famous figures of our history beside us. The gacha is cruel, yes.

I'll be playing this for a while yet.",positive

All in all I really like this game. You run out of AP points extremely fast at higher levels and if you're not careful it can cost you a small fortune to recharge your AP points. I must add that the Auto recharging of AP points is nice but I can't sit around all day waiting for that to happen to continue playing the game. I need to add their are alot of technical issues. The current statesman quest can't even be completed. These guys either deleted or sold my account.,positive
"Decent, the amount of depth in team builds is good-ish other than about 85% of the servants are either useless or outdone by the current meta. Every chapter aside from the intro and last chapter are useless/negligible in regards to story. Some missions are long and tiring. Grind is boring, needs more things to make mundane things like EXP or material grind short. Skip tickets would be phenomenal. If it weren't for the horny people whaling for this game, probably would've died a long time ago.",negative

The game is cool but if don't spend money on it you will get no were in the game an less you want 3 star character which in every summon and that not the worse part with every summon you will always get a craft essence 4 or 5 so getting a character is like 1 in a trillion chances to get the character you want or even just to get a good character. The game need to lower the craft essence by alot and raise the chance to get a character or make it easier for player which as been playing for year,positive
Try adding auto battle for farming. I won't even talk about the rate up...,negative
"Gib meh free SQs UwU Ok seriously, The game has a very low chance to get a 5*, but it compensates it by being a FTP Friendly, Even a Free to Play Player can sometimes get a 5 star.",positive
I love this game but drop rates are crazy low,negative
"Is definitely a fun game and as much as gacha rates are complained about, dont really see an issue as its hard not to roll servants every now and then. Even without rolling said servants, you can roll for 1-3*s daily which aren't really worse than 4-5*s outside of base stats due to lower levels. The gameplay itself is pretty unique vs other mobile games you see around and am kind of disappointed we don't see more games using it. Still waiting for tsukihime collab",positive
"Very good, alot of improvement. Now i can play it.",positive
Best game but fix the gacha rate please,positive

"It's a fun game just don't spend money often, maybe once here and there but be careful. Story is good üëå",positive
I've been playing the game for over 2 years now. If you're a fan of the fate series it's definitely a game worth checking out. The story is fun and the gameplay is engaging. The only reason I'm giving a four star review is that the loading times take forever.,positive
Rate-up is a lie,neutral
"The gameplay is very good and is balaced fantastically (For the most part), focusing more on strategy than brute strength. Even though the gacha rates are really bad, the game itself gives you a decent amount of gacha currency and is balanced around roles instead of specific characters.",positive

"I am a fan of Fate series, and I like to collect servants haha, the Gacha system is hurtful as always(makes me see the reality of whaling system) however the game is pretty good, with the original seiyuus on the characters--I'm fangirling over them.

"Playing for about a week, its a great gacha game as long as you remember you have limited resources as a fp2 (unless you're not). But what got me hooked was the story, and i hope they continue to develop games with stories like fgo",positive
"probably one of the best games I've played on my phone. The fact I can play and beat everything with just the basic servants really makes me feel like I can beat any encounter with proper planning. I also quite enjoy that there is no pay to win, and it doesn't constantly try to get into your wallet with constant ""deals"" either. My only complaint is that the grind for materials can be a bit much. Overall I am really happy with this game.",positive

I have been playing this for nearly 2 years now. It sucks that I'm not a day 1 player and that I lost my account twice (completely my fault). I stayed and came back for the awesome story and the probability of meeting great characters. I enjoyed all the events so far and I think I'm gonna continue playing for years to come.,positive
"I started this game as a test of will, to see how long it would take me to crack and spend money on a gacha game. What I got was an enjoyable game, and a step into a great series (though I recommend experiencing the other media first). The developers have lovingly improved this game as the story continues, and I have never seen a patch note I didn't like. Though the usual rates still dissuade me from spending, I'm no longer bothered by the idea of dropping money on this. Cheers.",positive
I like the story but the summon rates need some work on. It's so worth it when you get a 5 star.,positive
Great game every thing works well and balanced it's just the 5star gatch rate iv got none so far and it sucks after spending about 350 quarts just take the 5 star rate and atlest make it a bit higher and I do understand why it's like this because you well wouldn't be worth 4billion bucks and dangling our extremely feminized versions of historical figures in front our faces is how you've done it,positive
The summoning rate this game has enrages me. I just want at least one 4-5 servant per 30 saint roll. When i spend two weeks farming for 30 saint crystals and all of it being craft essence which no one want and 3-2 servents which i got multiple it makes me sad. Either seperate the crafting essence into another roll or change the summoning rates pls and the gameplay is a little stale. Well at least they have lots of events that give saint crystals and sometimes give free servant events.,negative
Just finished solomon after a long while Here is my take on it So damn addicting with intresting gameplay Being can be played in both F2P and whaling And the character design itself has proven to me that it is worth my time sinking hundreds of hours in this,neutral

It's possible to get everything you want in the game as long as you're willing to invest your time into the game and having great amounts of luck. It's not a typical play to win game as paying does not guarantee you have an advantage. My one complaint is the excess amount of farming needed to get materials to strengthen your characters.",positive

"Edited from 1st review: So from my experience, the game is enjoyable though prone to mental exhaustness. There is a variety of characters to love, waifus and husbandos alike. The story for each singularity gets better, one of the game's charms. My main gripe to the game is probably its grindiness and cruel gacha rates. But, if you're a regular gacha player, these aspects of gacha games are their norms. All in all, fan of Nasuverse or not, you can immerse yourself in FGO",positive

Good game...but the fact that you're limited in what you can do because of QP is...ridiculous. Wanna level up a servant? Fork it over. Wanna level up a Servants skills? More QP. I find it ridiculous that QP has to be used for something that's a basic part of an RPG.,negative

"Aside from the typical unforgiving and lying gacha rate-up system, the game itself is pretty good. Pretty much turn based card game. You will get free currency to roll for servants you want to help you build your team to beat story mode and bosses. It is F2P. You don't personally need 4/5* servants to beat bosses, game forces you to select a support so you can definitely get through. Also as long as you're leveling the right servants and their skills, you'll be good.",positive

Great Fate Game! There should also be a way to bind an account for reliable save progress. Energy regeneration should be 1 energy per 3min not 5min. It also has a problem when opening the app. It get stucks at loading screen so you have to click home then press the fgo app again for it to work.,positive
"Absolutely loved it, Currently finished till prologue and there was never a time I didn't enjoy the battles of the Main Campaign. The game regularly adds events and keeps the thrill. Even tho the gacha rates are low, If you properly upgrade even the R characters, you can expect easy victories. My favorite Singularity is 6th, the battles felt challenging even though I had been playing for around 400 days and enjoying the events in the background. 100% recommended app, great story and gameplay.",positive

"As a 4 year veteran, the game play and the amount of synergy goes beyond what hou can imagine. Sure there will be ups and downs with the gacha system. I will admit it can be downright cruel... HOWEVER higher rarity isnt essentially better. You can achieve the same achievements like the Dolphins and whales, but at a slower pace. The game make you think like a game of chess and a bit of RNG is played into. Nonetheless, the most diverse game I've encounter and I do not regret playing after 4 yrs.",positive

It's a great game not really much to complain about except the way of data restoration instead of linking to your Google account in the corner of the start screen it has a spot where you can transfer your data at which point I was never told about even when the game connects to your Google account they can't restore your data if you want to restore your data one thing they want you to tell that's optional but seems more like a needed sense names don't seem to work as a way to restore,positive

"Fun to play with an interesting story, but manual leveling through items (think upgrading weapons in other games), and pathetic gacha odds are clearly designed to frustrate players into spending as much money as possible. This game is accessible to free players, but expect massive amounts of grinding after the 3rd or 4th chapter. Enemy stats also make no sense according to the level scheme, and bosses' HP is padded to absurd levels to force players to purchase revives. Fun but less so if F2P.",negative
"Been playing for roughly a year now. Here's a quick rundown: a great story that starts off slow, but builds up considerably by the time you reach singularity six. Gameplay may seem lackluster, but (for me) strategy for my party comps was crucial by the time you end singularity 5. The grind for mats is long yes, however there are events roughly every month that always increases rate of finding items. Gacha rates are low, however the (first half of) the game is beateable with 1-3 star servants.",positive

I wont give it a 5 star due to the salt inducing gacha pulls and stupid spooks i've been getting. Aside from that this game deserves a 4* for just the thrilling plot once you reach camelot and its succeeding story. I for one have been a f2p and been enjoying this game to months end. Dont get discouraged by the lower star reviews of the game and rather judge it yourself if its a game for you or not and note that even 2 or 3* servants are still as effective as 4-5* servant with the correct setup,positive

An overwhelming majority of female servants are drawn to be objectified and sexualized, even the underage looking ones in addition to the ones with huge breasts.

Drop rates for gacha pulls are abysmal. Conversion rate for real money to in game currency is inexcusably expensive.

A very well made game however if you are not a fan of the series or to strategy games then this is not for you especially if you are a free to play player since this game requires heavy dedication in earning the money required to summon things to make your gameplay easier or make your units stronger so if you are a casual gamer who only want to enjoy games and all then prepare to be tested to your limits in both patience and persistence in playing this game.,positive

"I have played this game since launch. I love this game and I still do, but I hate the account recovery system. It is ""primitive"" when compared to other mobile gatcha games. I just wish that they update this part of the game. Me and a couple of my friends dropped this game not because we were bored of it, but because we couldn't recover our accounts when we got new phones; even customer support couldn't help us out.",positive

"I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now since the release and all I can say is that this is one of the best games that fate franchise has come up with. I like how the story progresses but in terms of gameplay, you'll need all the luck you can get since this is a gacha game and without good or decent servants, it really is difficult to progress in the game but that's what this game is, you need to grind and farm your way out of hell.",negative

God I love this so much i play every damn day and like almost whole day and this is only game i play,positive
"I love Fate, but when I see the gacha rates in this, I already know I'm in for a predatory cash trap. It makes me sad to see this. There are more 5-star servants than 3 and 4-stars in the game, yet the drop pool for a single 5-star servant is 1%, and the odds of you getting a specific 5-star servant is 0.015%. That's a one in a ten-thousand chance. You would have better chances to win the lottery than this. It sucks to see this because this game's story, graphics, and gameplay is solid.",positive
It was a fun game..,positive
The gameplay and grapics are simple yet they get ypu fully engaged in the game the only downside is the slow load times loading up the game and in between missions,positive
Lost all my servants,negative
Best gacha ever. Only the loading issue is keeping me from fully playing this game. 2 mins loading screens breaks immersion,positive
"I cannot recommend this game enough. Fate is the most generous gacha game in existence premium currency is easy to earn, and often gifted. If you don't know this is based off an already popular anime/game/book series so all of the art, voice, and story work is top notch professional. Don't get me started on the characters and main story, which make up enough content to keep you engaged for months. Plus events are held often, and all have their own detailed plot on top of new and unique gameplay.",positive
"Goods: Story/Events are every captivating. You can never get bored with the story, even if it's light-novel style. Servants are well-designed and DW continue updating animations for players' needs. Simple game control but great strategy involvements.The ONLY bad thing: Gacha system is broken. If you're F2P, this game isn't for you unless you don't care much about getting good Servants. Continuous limited and non-limited 5* Servants are very hard to get unless you're willing to spend real money.",negative

A great game best anime game,positive
Love this game!!!!,positive
"Having an amazing roster of characters where you can learn genuinely factual information from these historical characters (most of the time), combined with gameplay that's not as brain dead as other gacha games definitely makes this an EX rank game where you can play for free without ads and buying new content although you do need some luck to get your desired characters in the gacha. Definitely recommend if you are new to the Fate franchise!",positive
Love this game there shouldbe more servamts you can getfor free like chacha and elizabeth balthory and her alt clases,positive

Very nice And thats about it,positive
Good game little behind its jap version some chars could use some tlc but over all not bad for a gacha game story is pretty nice to even if ur not a fate fan and if u are all the better,positive
Still a 5/5 since released. Best mobile gacha game I have played ever.,positive
Excessively long loading times with no sound or music while loading. Note 9.,negative
Really really fun and good story I do want male summer servents though,positive
The game captures the essence of the Fate series/ visual novel.,positive
"The game is 2 years behind the Japanese release. You'll see content in forums and in news articles that you won't get to interact with for 2 years. It's a bad game in it's current US release state and unfortunately, it will continue to be bad until 2 years rolls around. The dev decision to leave the releases unsynced is a ploy to generate more money. Save your time and change. This game isn't worth it.",negative
Good story characters and combat easy to control I personaly enjoy the graphics,positive

I've played this game for years and still find it enjoyable.,positive
"To put simply, this game is a cashgrab. Although the visuals, the story, and the characters are amazing, I do not recommend this game to anyone. I put thousands of hours into the game, it is the addiction to it that keeps me here.",positive
"Good experience overall, Is just like reading a light novel with basically Fate characters as protagonists, NPs look good but gacha is bad Civilization. Also a lot of salt, enough to build a mine.",negative

"A fantastic game but heavily grindy game. The story is fantastic and the gameplay is fun and tactical. With constant events coming out there's always a plethora of content to indulge in. The only real gripe I've had with the game is the abysmal gacha rates, but having rare servants is in no way required for story progression.",positive
The writing in this game is excellent for its genre. The artwork is beautiful. Content is also very accessible for low-budget or Free-to-Play players to enjoy. (And Archer finally seems to be enjoying his existence X3),positive
Fun game with a great story. Especially enjoy the seasonal events,positive

1. You will die a lot 2. You will cry a lot 3. You will curse a lot 4. But you will have a lot of happy memory playing this game.,positive
"Very grindy, but it's also fun and challenging. The story gets better as you go through chapters. Gacha rates are do or die, but you can get through battles with low rarity Servants. It's part of the fun. Characters are especially fun and unique. It's hard not to get attached.",positive

"An interesting interactive novel style game. Only drawback is a grind to improve characters. Those with patience will do well over the long haul, regardless of which characters you obtain.",positive
"Full VN level story. An annoying but ultimately minor issue is that the plot assumes you have participated in events you probably weren't around for and may not come around again for a long time. Not in major ways, just a ""oh yeah we already know this person from X"", but you've never been a part of X, kind of way. So them showing up and helping is kind of nonsense.",negative

I tried to replay this game for 2 rounds at different timeline and i still could not enjoy due to the gacha rates and its so hard to F2P players as the reward system is getting worse. Completed the same stage 3 times to get one crystal and not even all the stage has it ??? I am ok with the gameplay the animation and character design are nice but too me its not to worth to spent so much money on time and the event is a joke i cant even play a single event due to the requirments.,negative
-Updated. Recently they released various sprite animation updates for characters early and I must say they are much needed. Again. If you are looking to start playing this game now is a good time. The only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars is the static illustrations. I've seen fans edit and give the already beautiful illustrations more life when they give them small animations. Overall I am loving my time playing the game. A must for Fate fans. Ushi animation update when?,positive
sliiiiightly upset my chromebook in apperantly an ''emulator'' and cant load this,negative
The story will hook you up. The Servants itself is full of flavors to explore. The challenge to get them strong will make you want to grind I just hope the availability of saint quartz are a little bit higher to the point you can get atleast 5 saint quartz in weekly quest,positive
good game i think i lost my sanity here,positive
One of the best Mobile games,positive
Mediocre gameplay at best. Horrible gacha. This game is carried by its story which is very boring in the begining. Grinding saint quartz takes several tedious battles of multiple waves of enemies. If this wasnt fate this game would have failed as it should have.,negative

The game could use some optimization for better performance. The interface is very dated.,positive
As someone who generally finds mobile games mediocre I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only did this game have solid gameplay but that once you got through the early chapters the writing vastly improved to the point where this is probably one of the best written games producing content this year. This is the first game to sell me on mobile gaming as a serious platform. I highly recommend it.,positive

A couple easy weekly quests and simply logging in once a day is all you really need to do to get the free currency. 5 stars are of course, rare, but almost every servant in the game does the job. So you need to SAVE for the people you want. No in game cash shop (just paid currency bundles that's it) no ads, balanced servants for most part. Great storytelling!",positive

"A solid turn-based RPG game. If you're a fan of the fate series, you should try it, but it's pretty nice even if you're new to it. Though I must say that a majority of gameplay is farming/grinding in events and such. The summoning system has one of the worst rates, but the game is very doable with low-rarity units and borrowing a friend's unit. The story starts out as decent, but it really ramps up a lot later on. I'd say it's worth a shot. Been thru lot of bs as JP and EN player, but it's üëç",positive

It's fun but the progression seems way to slow whether it's xp or gaining stars for draws. I usually save up for a year so I can draw twice. Also the events feel tedious unless you have the specific event units and unless you got cash to burn you might not get to into it. As for experience it would be nice if your units gained xp from battles and it did not depend solely on card sacrifice and if that's the case atleast if the quality of draws was better or access to gold enhance was better.,positive

"It's a fun game, great characters, Noble phantasms are cool, to do one summon is clearing one singularity and a little of the next. My one big problem is the chances of getting a craft essence, for example you could hit a multi summon and get 4 of the same 4* or 5* craft essences instead of getting a 4* or 5* servant. You could also get the same 3* servant 3 times and the same craft essence 7 times. Summons mainly depend on gacha so I can't complain too much. Craft essence % is just too high",positive

Plus, there's no auto run feature or enough farming areas to compensate for it. Don't expect to beat Arc 1 in 8 months. Don't bother with the 1% gacha rate. For positives, the music is phenomenal, and the story, save for ch 2 & 3, can be really engaging and fun, like a visual nice. It's a fine game. Just a bit niche for me.",positive
"i've been playing this game for 18 months and I enjoyed every bit of it, however the extremely long load time is just making want to smash my head in wall. seriously 1 minute 50 seconds just to enter stage?",positive
"I've been palying this game since it's release. But i've lost my transfer number, Is there any way for me to get my account back? Thanks",positive
"The game is amazing, I just wish the updates didn't take up so much space. That might be hard but... Anyway, this is an amazing game, probably my favorite, the storyline is intriguing. And to top it all off, the ladies can be pretty. It has historical and legendary figures, which can be very helpful. The best thing to see is when you're doing a summon and you see that golden twinkle.",positive
"This game is great i love how it has a deep story that keeps players attention and how there is so many heroes from history and stories, but the only thing I think they need to work on is the summoning system to make it more favorable for the players who want a higher rank hero.",positive
Engine Update please,positive
"I don't know if it's just my phone that's lagging or it's the game itself, but it took me 3 minutes at minimum in loading page, watching Fou running on the lowest right part of my phone, everytime I start a game. I mean, I hope you lessen the time it takes to load up a game, as it ruin the over all gameplay for me.",negative
I got bored at the story but i like the gameplay i also hate that you can summon items,negative
Unbelievable,positive
"Can't recommend enough, but be careful! Honestly, amazing game play experience, with amazing story and no need for 5 star servants to complete anything story-wise. Premium currency is not too rare, and while others say the gacha is awful, I've been playing for 3 weeks or so and have 2 SSRs so, maybe I'm just lucky? Anyways, the game is grind heavy (especially to level up servants!) and you won't always get what you want from gacha. Just play with an open mind and enjoy the story and characters.",positive
Fate grind order is sexy great and fun,positive
"Would put 5 stars but rates for gacha are not great. Campaign grinding/quartz drops are not great either especially on top of the long loading times and multi-step quests. Though the story is great, and characters are awesome. I still enjoy the story more than anything.",positive
It's cool,positive
This game is good once you get that specific servant which is gonna make you very happy.,positive
Has great potential but is very much after your cash and teases you.,negative

"One of the best mobile games I've played. Dozens of Heros to choose from, each with their own voice and back story. The game play is fun and isnt reliant on microtransactions.There is an extremely engaging story, unlike many mobile games that claim to have an amazing main story in adds, but don't actually have much of a plot in game, we all know what game I mean rhymes with ""PaidShallowLeggings. Fate/Grand Order is really a true gem and deserves the praise & attention it's received.",positive
"Used to love playing. Now it just crashes immediately upon opening, even after reinstall. Update: seems disabling developer options allows me to play so I'll bump up my review a bit. Still shouldn't be such an issue.",positive
"This game is a great time, great characters and the gameplay is easy to pick up. The gatcha rates aren't great but it makes it that much more satisfying when you get a Merlin or Waver. Ps. Don't put money into this, just go F2P and enjoy it for what it is",positive

"I really like this game. There are elements that remind me of Chain Chronicle, which I really liked as well. The combat system is simple yet also requires some level of strategy. The story and characters are on point. Some of the more recent events have felt a bit repetitive and boring, though.",positive
"Summoning rate it awful, especially during event banners when you're looking to get CE's to help you out.",negative
2 years of playing. Sorry developers I didn't paid stars just to desperately get some 5 stars. I had 3 accounts playing and every profile had a good set of servants. It's just a matter of how to use heroic spirits carefully. But I totally agree that you need more 5* servants to excel. Thanks by luck I manage to get good 5*. Love the game keep improving.,positive

"Fate Grand Order is a game set in Type Moon Universe. This is the game which story trully define the game. Although the mechanics is on the older side, mind you the game have been released in 2015. The 2 years gap between global server compared to the Japan, gave global player an edge by having prediction of what events or Gacha Banner will occur. Although the Gacha rate is on the low rate side, you don't actually need good units to clear the content. Hence pretty much Free to Play.",positive

Good game but rate up is a lie. No üß¢,negative
Hmmph!,neutral
"It's an unregulated casino. Every part of the game is set up to direct you towards the slot machine summoning system. Story? Free buffet and show to keep you interested. Plus, you like this character? Well, either hope you have godly luck, or fork over some cash (~$140 for 50% to get a 'rate up' character), because the majority of them are limited time only. Gameplay is mostly just grind to build sunk cost. That, and an incentive to roll the slots for things to reduce the amount of grind.",positive
"The story and history of each servant was great. The developer of this game is a genius, keep it up and keep updating",positive
My first Gacha game. Love it so much.,positive
Great story and interesting characters,positive
It's a great game I'm not sure who some of the characters are I have only seen Zero. Gameplay is ok the cards are an interesting new fight system but the game feels slow.,positive
Hope to see a pinoy hero to be a servant,positive
I have been playing this game for about 10 months now and it has been a great experience. The gacha can be hell but when you get that servant you desperatly want its such a great feeling. The battle mechanics are wonderful and i love the fact that aniplex is always trying to keep players entertained with as much content as possible. Keep up the great work.,positive
"I play this game for a long time. The only things that got me into the game is either the characters or the story line. I stop EN version a long time ago and start the JP. The rate up is so low. The game play is not that interesting. If you like it you'll like it, but overall, it's very easy to get bored",positive

Love the gameplay(pretty addicting)and the amount of stuff you can earn by playing but i find that the prices for their currency is too much considering the actual chances you have of getting the characters you want is slim to none. You would expect to have a greater chance when spending as much as a triple A game on it but don't count on it.,positive
Fixed,neutral
Long time fan of the series. That being said. Do not make the mistake I did and waste your money. I've had three accounts I've spent exuberant amounts on. Couldn't get the first two back after phones died. They are not friends of the fans. The amounts of money it takes to get what you need is outrageous. Oh btw your latest update wont let me into my account again. Downloaded update and still tells me I need to download something even though that's no longer an option in the store. GREED.,negative
"I think that some people may have some problems by not being able to play the game, but it works fine, it's just some people are just unlucky, but overall it is a successful japanese app game which made it's own reputation, memes, of course some people may complain about the maitnance being longer than it supposed to be, but without it, it wouldn't be fun to make jokes about it.",positive

I really like everything about the game but needs a lot of time for grinding that most people can't focus on reading the story and playing events at the same time. Hope they add a feature where you can skip np animation while doing a free quest which is already completed once. It will help the game alot.,positive
I love this game to the Core completed every single day for the past four or five months. Tonight I spent $123 on summons and they didn't even have the respect for their customers enough to give big fenders a single four or five star servant. I've been a fan of the feet series for over a decade since 2007. I'm afraid after this I'm done with type c feet and most especially Grand order unless an admin comes down from on high give me three five star servants right now yeah right they don't care,positive
This game need improvements badly you always gotta save up quarts for your favorite or a important servant bad enough you might not even get them you'll fail or either get the opposite events are boring and the campaigns don't give out much pleses fix fgo I still love it tho it's still a good game thoses who left already from fgo just gave up I stood with it until I got some good 5 stars from scratch too but yeah good game.,positive
I like fate series and this game too,positive
"Best RPG-Gacha game. You dont need summon ssr or sr, 1-3 stars + your brain can do the quest. Always give many free 4 star servant every year. Gameplay is good, grahic is awesome, story is cool, but gacha is terrrribbble... Play it slowly, the ap generated very low. Just enjoy it!",positive

The game is Very addicting You will get very interested in stoy after playing Plus the servents have their own stories,positive
"It's an okay game, though the Telltale style of the illusion of choice makes some responses to what you say make little sense during the campaign. It's also extremely annoying that they force you to have somebody else's servant in your party for every battle since it either carry's you through or you're forced to spend time finding one near your level so you can have some form of difficulty; they need to make it an optional thing instead of forcing it on you.",negative

Game keeps crashing on my phone. Was looking forward to play this as a fate fan,positive
"If you are a fan of the Nasuverse and can't get enough of learning about new Servants, I highly recommend you play this game. The story and events are interesting, and it's always a pleasure to see characters from the other Nasuverse series pop in.

"Update for year 2020, Fate/Grand Order is great, i was a huge fan of the Fate series since playing Fate/Stay Night way back in 2012, its a great franchise, all the servants you get in the game are all unique, with their very own personality, story and lore. The only qualm that most players have and myself is that the gacha rates are very unforgiving and it might be hard to get the servant that you really want, all you can hope is just roll and plenty of good luck! Play well, masters!",positive

I've played this years ago but stopped and i just returned from playing again this year. Reason i stopped before coz of the app crashing while playing and it annoyed me. I'm having fun right now since i'm fan of the series. I dont have any problems as of yet aside from the abyssmal drop rate. Atleast increase the rates a little bit somehow. Up to 5% wont hurt you know and 7% during rate ups. event CE drop rates during events is bad as well but doesnt concern me much. 4* only coz of droprates.,positive

I'm not even addicted to the game. I play the story when each singilarity is released, and every other event. The materials and Golden Apples you get from the events are enough to completely max out all your Servants, and I legit haven't run out of AP in years.

Fgo is one of the only games I actually keep on my phone.The only thing I can say is that if you arent a very patient person than this is not the game for you because this is a grindy game and the gacha rates can kill some people.But once you start to play the game you get invested in charaters and plot.,negative

Fantastic game that is actually more intricate then meets the eye. There are many different characters to play with and despite the rarity system all of them can be used since there is no pvp gameplay in this. The story is great and only gets better and better as the writing gets more on par with a well written anime as you progress. There is also no need to have played any other Fate games or have watched any of the Fate anime adaptations but it would certainly make you like more characters!,positive

The story is well written and only gets better as it goes on, the events are frequent and engaging and the animations are breathtaking.

In fact, because of this game I actually watched UBW and Zero (HF is next). My point is, this game is fun and explains just enough to a newcomer that it makes sense and is engaging.",positive
It's fun and true enough to the source material.,positive
"Game play is slightly on the slower side in the actual fighting, as there are very few ways to speed up Noble Phantasms (such as there being no way to completely skip the animations), so battle appears to be drawn out at times, but it's just the idea that this is the case. I must give this game a full 5 by 5 rating... The story is so well written, even an old man like me teared up at times. (Not enough room to say it all... Give this game a chance, it's in the top grade range.)",positive
Slower load times than a PS1 game. Gameplay is extremely boring RNG with the card command system. On top of all that it is grossly pay walled for exclusive servants with low gacha rates. Event grinding is a total slogfest which is almost mandatory because normal drop rates for progression are also abysmal. Just an overall pretty bad game in general with half baked mechanics that is actually a casino simulator.,negative

Its not impossible, its just annoying sometimes.",positive

"It's been 3 years and I'm still playing. I really like the characters and I got a lot that I like so not quitting any time soon. It's a good strategy game with very nice visuals. The icing on the cake for me is the story, which is very good. I'd say that getting people to play is hard especially the Fate uninitiates, since it lacks the ""nitro-charged action"" that most people go for and there is a lot of lore to sift through to be up to speed on the story.",positive
Amazing game. Good story and the servants are fun. You can play without sinking a ton of money for in game currency despite what is said.,positive

"I dont understand why they cant upgrade their servers. You cant always connect everytime theres an update because they cant handle so much players traffic. Their customer supports sucks also, if you somehow lost your data, it will take them days just to send you bot reply and it will take another days just to figure out your account with 50-50 chance of recovery.",negative

Sure the gacha rates might be on the low side but 5* servants aren't really necessary to beat the game, some of them do make the game a lot easier though and getting that 5* servant you always wanted might not come true but if you do get her/him it just makes the game so much better, the salt might also make you want to quit the game but once you become a veteran of the game, it doesn't really matter anymore.

Plus MEME",positive
How to fix the Long loading It takes 2 or more minute to load,neutral
Still cannot play. When I try to launch the app it launches X-Plore from google app store. This has to be a bug on the side of Fate. After uninstalling X-plore I still cannot launch Fate.

"An amazing game with a great story, based on the highly acclaimed Fate Stay universe. Only problem is the gacha rates are atrocious (possibly the worst in any gacha game), but almost every battle is still winnable with teams of lower rarity servants anyway. A waifu collector at its core.",negative
"Doesn't load on my phone at all, and takes waaaaay to long to load on my tablet, during the summoning process I closed the app and reopened it to save myself at least probably half an hour, I do have slow internet connection, but if you guys want players your ga,e should be ready for that.",positive

the game is great! the story is great! <3 Gilgamesh! I wish I could play my account also in other devices. I can only play my account in one device which sucks when I want to play it on my tablet next because my phone is charging,positive
"The Game is really good, lets you feel the bliss of achievement and hardwork. The event are entertaining and the story mode is over-the-top. I'll just leave few suggestions. Receiving blaze of wizdom during log-in are way to absurb, i should recommend giving us apple instead due to the fact that the longer the game the higher AP it consumes..",positive
"1a. Increasing 5* rates will make people summon more. Just look at Dokkan Battle. 1b. Step banners with guaranteed featured unit will have the same impact. 1c. Making the prices of the Crystals cheaper will make people purchase more. 2. After a few years, the ui and menu seems outdated. Updating it will make it look fresh and exciting. 3. Make Crystals easier to obtain via log in, celebrations, etc. Other than that, this game is tip top.",positive
"Gatcha stuff aside, game should have NP skip for farming QoL. Nobody want to sit around farming for 2+ hour looking at the same NP animation for a billion time. Also, 3x gameplay speed and 1/2 current AP cut on dailies is highly appreciated.",positive

I would have given it a 5 star but the game doesnt function at times even tho its updating anything but other than that its good and slightly addictive,positive
"If I could, I would honestly give this game a negative rating. I usually have patience when it comes to rerolling for a specific unit. However, if the game constantly crashes because of communication errors, the banner is only up for 24 hours, and the summoning rates are so bad to the point that it seems rigged, I can really say that it doesn't have any potential to be a fun game at all. I would think there would be at least some compensation for the servers crashing but of course not.",negative
"I love this game to death. I'm addicted to gacha games but FGO has centralized my addiction. That said, I have a suggestion. Plenty of people, myself included have accidentally burned servants or CE's we didn't mean to. What I suggest is a system that allows ths return of previously summoned CE's or Servants. Have a system in place that allows them to reclaim that unit at least once as long as there's no copy of the unit in their archive or inventory. Also make its resource cost based on stars.",negative

"The gacha system on this game is hot garbage. It is also way to grinding with no payoff. Gameplay is average paper, rock, scissors style. Only good thing about it is the characters but good luck to get anyone you want because summons are both characters and essence which lower chances of getting characters.

Former JP server player transferred to EN server when it came out. This is one of the few top notch mobile game you will ever find. 1. Plenty of story (if you are a fan of the Fate Series and Light Novel type games) 2. Simple Game Mechanics (easy learning curve) 3. No intrusive and abusive ADs (just pure raw gameplay) *edited my review in lieu of the recent Lostbelt Update (since now EN server is catching up to JP server content release/s),positive

Only thing I don't like is the Transfer Number thing. Wish it was binded with Google or other cloud storage services. The gacha system might be a little unfair sometimes. But overall this is one of my favorite games ever. By the way, it's completely ridiculous the fact this version is delayed TWO YEARS from the Japanese version.",negative
Nice ez gacha,positive
"Love the characters & story, but gameplay is mindlessly grindy. I love tha Fate franchise and tried many times to like this game but its just too repetitive. The slow loading time doesn't help either.",positive
"Story is great, of course, it's written by Kinoko Nasu himself... Well except for Septem. I'm a fan of Nasuverse and like the concepts and mechanics of it. Graphics are not really terrible, but you need to update the animations of several outdated Servants, for example Ushiwakamaru(Rider) Gameplay... Too much grinding but it's rewarding, and you don't actually need five stars to win, though it's a bonus. Many free four stars are OP, can rival the five star and sometimes you can get them for free",positive

"FGO is good civilization. Seriously though, it's a pretty solid game despite its simplicity. My only issue with it is how long it takes for the story to get interesting (the writing early on is pretty mediocre). When the story finally gets going though, it's fantastic. I also dislike how limited the soundtrack is. Even without farming, I quickly grew tired of it and opted to play my music in the background instead.",positive
This is a nice game for all the Fate Series fans. I love it,positive

Only problem is events that don't let you play them,negative
"Everyone should play this game. Saint quartz should be cheaper and 5* rates should be higher. I've easily spent over $1000 in my 3 years of play, and while I have a very well rounded team, I find very few people are willing to invest as much as I have to achieve similar results... Obviously it doesn't make it that difficult to do challenges seeing as there is no PvP, but still. Everyone should be able to roll their waifu.",positive
"I just love this game. Nothing really more to say I'm a big fan of the anime, I love the storylines, and the events",positive
"It's awesome, you get to make you're team of servents like you were in one of the animes, but sometimes you run out of quartz before you get that servent you want. It's not pay to win but I wish there were more quartz.",positive
"Story is great, but the gameplay is basic.",positive
Always been a great game from when i lost my first 4 accounts. Lol. But the strategic gameplay is really gd. Just a fun game if you are into jrpg's. And the nasu verse keeps expanding on the game. Thats awesome.,positive

i simply love the game plus the servants and especially all of its story and events. The graphics are simple but good though it really is sad on the gacha part.

You cant really have that feeling of certainty that you'll get the servants you want but that flaw could not beat how the story is very good and events makes it even better especially those welfare servants.,positive

"Its ONLY redeeming factor is turn based combat. Still art is only thing decent. *edit* This game still has no binding feature. Do NOT spend money on this game. I've lost access to my account twice now (update related reset), they restored it once, they also indicate if you change your device (whether upgrading or failure forced) they are not going to restore your account.

"The game won't open, it directs me to my gmail app",neutral
One of my favorite games,positive
"Honestly a solid game. Visuals and gameplay are considerably simple, but it leads to an addicting experience. Gacha is a love/hate relationship; low rarity units and free event units, along with friends units, are enough to get you through the main story and probably post-game, but for those that want unique or powerful characters, the gacha is your worst nightmare. My main complaint for this game is general lack of end game content; beyond events and slow story additions, there's nothing to do",positive
"Fun game to play...but... Summoning sucks, all you get is useless craft essences. Getting heros with a 10 pull from 30 Quartz is next to impossible even with drop rate increases. Takes awhile to get 30 Quartz and they reward you with 10 cards (no matter the number of stars) that will never be used",positive

False drop rates. Waste of money. Nearly 500 summons and 1 five star servant. Not a single 4 star Saber and performed 10 x 10 summons during a Sabers ONLY event. Better odds at a casino. The game author should be ashamed with what they are doing.,negative

"Love the characters and the art design. But end-game is ridiculously grindy and repetitive. The challenge quests (obstensibly to offer challenge and critical thinking) are really just tests to see if you have one or several of the most top tier characters in the game e.g. Merlin and Waver, and don't even offer any challenge if you do. CQ's are undoable without these rate servants. Story is poorly written or translated, with drawn out dialogue. Gacha rates are extremely poor with little F2P SQ.",negative

I've been f2p since day one. Grinding in this game does require a lot patience when farming accention materials. Though this game may not be for everyone due to the low drop rates which is expected from a generic gatcha. The story is okay but can get boring. The gatcha has extremely low drop rates which can be a pain in the ass when attempting to get a 5 star or 4 star jpeg wafu.

Yes, I do not have every available playable unit offered, but I have enough, and I still find myself enjoying the game and the events. If I miss something, then oh well. There's no point agonizing over it. This game is a good way to pass the time. I'd recommend it to others.",positive

"Game is great. Story is awesome (not all of it, mind you. Looking at you Septem and Agartha). System is not too complex, and the game regularly rewards you. Artwork are top-notch, and the graphics and animations are all very well done. This game definitely set itself apart from other Gacha games which merely uses chibified sprites of their characters. Though you're more likely going to win the lottery or get hit by a lightning on your birthday than getting a single freaking SSR.",positive

I don't like the unfair percentage rate of summon in this game because I can't get the unit that I want and I myself is a regular player not a pay to play player so it is a disadvantage especially when receiving games to summon. So please fix your system to make fair for regular players,positive

"Love the game and the lore, natrually feels a bit grindy and takes a large chunk of time to get your favorite servants to maximum level and bond. Rate up is a lie, but every servant is viable in their own way, so that's okay. Graphics are amazing, some animations can feel outdated, though they are frequently updated which makes me happy. Over all a great app and worth your time if you are a fan of the Fate Universe.",positive

"Other franchise improve along the years but there are some like this one that just doesn't in any aspect you can think of - events, summoning gachapon, premium currency, daily logins. The only thing that this game did good is their character drawings or maybe I should credit the artist instead.",positive
"Seriously I played for 4 months and the gacha rates are seriously rigged. Pull Multi 34 times in Arthur's banner, never get him at all. While some players flaunt in screenshots they got 2 Arthur in a single multi roll. The in game purchase is overpriced when the gacha rates is so low and rigged. I recommend new 7DS to anyone who wants good storyline, and better gameplay and graphic. The Ultimate animations feel like watching anime. And guaranteed SSR after failed to get one after 5 Pulls.",negative
"I really love this game, but I do have some issues with it. It can get very draining as it is 90% grind/farming. Back to back grindy events make it super exhausting at times. It's also not very F2P friendly. It's possible to be F2P, but it's very difficult, especially since drop rates are horrible and there's no summoning failsafe. These aren't game breaking problems, but they're problems some people may rightfully not want to deal with. Fixing them could potentially increase revenue.",negative

Fun and immersive game. Do yourself a favor and watch some tutorials before fully jumping into your game. It will save you time and make the experience so much better.,positive
"Not f2P friendly, no re-playability of the story. If they allowed more difficulties after you finish each singularity( I started the game mid September of last year, finished all singularities early December) game got boring after that. There was reward for playing much after that besides some nice events,. But if they would let us play the story again and gain sq's from playing each difficulty for each singularity that would make this a 7/5 game!!!!.",positive

Wonderful and fun game. Never been displeased,positive
Love the game a great time killer decent story and not to bad if you feel like dropping some cash completely optional though,positive
fun not overly addictive but sure too entertain you and bring you back its difficultly is dependent on your ability to use your servants to the best of your abilities even 2 star servants can finish the boss's if you use your head and raise them well,positive
"I really want to give this App a 5 star bc I have so much fun with this game. I love the story, style of play, and plot. After a recent survey the did a lot better of allowing players gathering Saint Quarts, and paying AP to do the story. (However, I want that to also to apply for stregnthening your servents when farming embers...). Spending Saint Qaurts to pull for servents is more of a miss than it ever is a hit.

"If you're looking for a game with blatant pedophilia, sexism, and transphobia that is all called ""fanservice"" look no further! I've been playing this game for a little under a year now, and I've hit a breaking point. Nearly every single female servant (INCLUDING THE CHILD ONES) are dressed in barely anything. Frequently, the child servants are dressed LESS than the adult ones (looking at you, Wu Zetian, Jack, and Jeanne Santa Alter).",negative

"Grindy Gameplay, Awful Customer Support, and Terrible Design. On top of the game itself being just a massive grind, the gacha being very bad in terms of your chance of getting anything good, and the overpriced cost of saint quartz. This game uses a terrible data transfer code system rather than an account system, which ensures that if you lose your device you have almost no way to recover your account since their customer support is completely unhelpful. Lackluster game made by terrible company.",negative

Amazing game so much fun only issue I have is the transition to Camelot from the previous singularity it's quite a big jump and I feel the difficulty should be lowered just a little bit so it's hard but not as hard but other than that it's a great game an easy 5/5 stars from me keep up the great work,positive

Definitely not new player and f2p friendly. Definitely not a gacha worth investing in for trying to summon for your favorite heroic spirit.",positive
"After being F2P for nearly two years, I can testify to its abyssmal summon rates, especially for SSRs. The summon rates are often the most cited problem with the game, and a reason for why many end up dropping it altogether (among others). The game isn't built or designed for get-powerful-quick schemes. It rewards you for dedication, persistence, and a little bit of luck, over time. And the rewards are sweeter when you work for it.

The gaxh system is very mix between okay and unforgiving but that most the fun when you save 200 quart(the gem currency) and you get 2 to 3 copies of a card, or none at all. The beginning is really easy then the start to make it slightly difficult by adding gimets that if you have the right rsources can just be annoying.",positive

But if you don't want to spend a penny on this game and can get through all of the exp grind for your units you might enjoy this game like I have. But sometimes it's good to look at it from the perspective of a player who has played many kinds of gacha games.

"Game is alright for fans of the series, but as a game itself it feels outdated compared to other mobile games. Graphics are 2d characters with simple animations. No auto battle of any kind which wouldnt be so bad except for the mass amounts of grind to upgrade 1 character, due to both low drop chances combined with materials that can only be farmed on a specific day. Typical stamina system to limit playtime. And overall nothing to really do unless you like the story they came up with.",positive

"The phrase ""its just a gacha game"" is such a f2p mindset. You are ok with the no pity system, low SSR rate, incompletion of the servantdex. When you stop getting angry after min rolls, you've lost twice. There's always more quartz to earn, and always a credit card for desperation. Never settle",negative
Best game ever but it'll ruin your life,negative
Its great for people who praises the Fate franchies,positive
Crashes on launch 100% of the time. Just goes straight to sending support an email. Pretty bad when the game won't even start on its first play. Seems to be a very widespread issue. Pretty hard to get new players that way. :/,positive
100% crash rate. Unable to start the game on multiple devices. Same issue in 2020.,negative
Don't recommend at all. The pool of characters is so diluted now with hundreds of characters and what seems like thousands of craft essences. This game does its best to make you feel like you need to fork over another 25 usd for another 10 roll just so you can have a chance at getting a somewhat decent character. More likely you'll get a CE. The game is fun if you get the good characters and the story can be neat. But it just sucks when you save hundreds of quartz and get nothing useful.,positive
It's Golden Experience.,neutral
Super awesome üëç,positive
I hate gacha.,negative
"The biggest issue with this game is the amount of grinding required to get the quarts, then when you use them your rare summons are craft essence 9 out of 10 times. This needs to be fixed, I dont need or want craft essence, I want new servants. The drop rates for craft essence are over double that of servants and that needs to change.",negative

"What can I say, I'm a fate fan... Though damn RNG, sigh~*",negative
"Graphics, gameplay, and story are amazing in my opinion. But that 1% chance to get a good char and the fact that grinding for saint quarts is tedious and potentially resourse intesive w/o one just makes that fact worse. Plus you're only garenteed 1 3 star or higher char with a 10x summon that cost 30 saint quarts. Literally the best way to grind w/o a 5 star char is just to log in consistently. It sucks that this is the case, but sometimes that's how the cookie crumbles",positive
This game is really awesome!!!,positive
The best and awsome game eveerrrrrrre...,positive
"Disappointed. It's a great game don't get me wrong but It is unforgiving with login bonuses and feels like you're not being given any reward because you only get one quartz per round of multiple battles. It's good, but exhausting...",positive

"If you don't have the money or the 100's of hours it requires to get the saint quart to buy the good servants, you're only getting craft essence. Gatcha system is rigged, the payout is often times trash, and the guarantee of a 4 star CARD and a 3 star SERVANT for 30 siant quartz is trash, they hand out 3 stars for free like candies, and the 4 star cards are almost always craft essence. Absolutely trash. Love the Fate series, but this is a horribly done gatcha system.",positive

"pretty fun game with a nice story. Its very easy to pick up but ofc being a gatcha game it can be hard to play the game with the chars you like if you are a free to play or anything below a whale or super lucky.The missing stars is really only because the price of the quartz in comparison to currency in other gatcha games is VERY expensive. Theres a good amount of ssr guarunteed spawns where you can only use paid for currency, but these dont count the ""free"" quartz bundled into the purchase.",positive
Just got into game and won't let me update. Update keeps restarting after reaching one hundred percent. Would suck to uninstall if not fixed but not gonna waste my time.,positive

All of the characters have a lot of personality and its easy to get attached to your favs! However the story dialogue is very convoluted and long, and most people I know end up skipping it. Also the chances if getting a 5 star are sooo bad. But if that stuff doesn't bother you, you will have a good time collecting attractive anime people.",positive

"Without a doubt, this game has the greatest storyline of all the games I've known. I can never get enough of this game since last 2 years, and just when I was going to give up on this game (bc of E-rank luck), my luck suddenly skyrocketed. Before I have only 2 SSRs and in just like 3 months I got 9 SSRs (I'm F2P btw). It's never too late to give up on things you are passionate about. Maybe you'll want to give up but it is at that time that you'll get what you were wishing. Or not.",positive

"Gatcha is a salty hell, but it makes the times it shines on you feel great. The story and frequent updates are the best parts of this game, not all the story is great som sections are low points while others are just pure pleasure to do. Gameplay is good but not great, its engaging with an RNG factor that can make each run feel different.",positive

Even 3 stars are useful, so despite the god awful rates of the SSR servants, don't let that discourage you from playing this! You will love the characters and the battle system!",positive

Very boring and not rewarding enough for the time that it takes to do everything.,negative
Good game but load times are atrocious. Sorry it is bad enough for me not to continue playing.,negative
This game is 50% load screens 50% gameplay. New players will have a rough start as the currency for summoning is very slow to obtain (1 per campaign mission completed) and you need 30! On top of that the rates are low and they don't seem to have any freebies to new players. This game feels like a waste of time.,positive
"Can't get past the tutorial. When I open the app, it crashes before I can do anything. Just port it to pc.",neutral
"While this game has some value to those who enjoy the franchise, I find it tiresome and unfulfilling due to its reliance on monetization in order to progress. That, coupled with the inability to reliably obtain the main source of summons through hard work / dedication, leaves me disappointed and unmotivated to continue playing.",positive

Is a good game but my problem is the loading takee to long,negative
"The game and story are enjoyable, the grinidng isn't the worst grind I've ever had. The low rarity servants, welfares and occassional SR tickets definitely help bolster your team options. If you are willing to invest funds once or twice a year there's the GSSR for a guaranteed 5* in case you are simply too unlucky to roll one normally. I genuinely enjoy the plot and the event subplots are also an enjoyable time, but I wouldn't recommend spending too much for this particular gacha outside GSSR.",positive
Everything is GREAT keep up the good work devs and can you please raise the draw rate of servants a little please,positive
I love this game it's my absolute favorite series and game but the reason it's only 2 stars is a story I had a great account both my favorite summons Jeanne arc and her alter form there was an incident were the wrong app got deleted and when I tried to use my transfer code it said already in use so now I have lost all my work and im left with the saddening trudge of trying to grasp and the pointless chance of getting them again ....,positive
Meh.,negative
"I would play this again, if only loadings were faster.",positive
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"FGO's story is steps above what most other Gacha games have. That being said only get into FGO if you are really into the Fate series and into Gacha games. The rate you get Saint Quartz (Premium Currency) to roll for Servants is slow unless there are a lot of events that shell it out. You can save up hundreds of dollars of Quartz on a rate up banner for a 4 or 5 star Servant and come out bust due to the sadistically low rates. Going Free to Play is possible, but it's going to be a ton of work.",positive
Cool.,positive
"Perfect game aside from the excessive rarity system popular with these kinds of games. I know someone who plays on the Japanese servers and they have almost every single 5* (highest rarity) character upgraded in a way that requires 4 additional copies of the same character to achieve, without spending too much. My brother playing on the American servers almost religiously for a year without spending anything and had 1 copy of maybe 10 (of around 50). Playing casually & spending $60, I got 3.",positive

One of the first mobile games with an actually good story.

Design and voice acting is also not mediocre at all due to talented actors and artists. Overall excellent game.,positive

It was a good game but I never acquired anything good from the saint quartz summoning... It's just way to frustrating after keeping a lot of it and it won't give you just one 4* fighter after a 2 or 3 of 30 saint quartz worth of summoning like what a waist.. Please improve it for once..,positive

"Gacha rates are pretty bad if you want a top tier servant. At the same time the difference between 3 and 5 star is a matter of inches usually, it matters for difficulty but doesn't gate any of the content. Favourite servant is a leonidas (2-star) that can loop his np and tank all damage when you level him up all the way, trivialising some late game bosses, so that's something. Lot's of events too so there is rarely a dull moment.",negative

"Unique mechanics and loveable difficulty spikes (after you get over the shock of dying instantly), and although the gacha is bad civilization, it's RNG is realistic.

Super fun to play. I love the fate series and fgo but I just wished this game didn't slap you in the face with terrible servant drops. Literally I'm only getting 3 star stuff and than when I do get a 5 star it's literally a craft essence. The game makes you grind almost towards the end of 2 chapters. That being it gives you 1 crystal each mission and at the endof the chapter it gives you 10. Don't get me wrong this game is by far one of the best jrpg out in NA these days. I love it tho.,positive
"Great game, if a bit overly grindy for some of the features. Only ""real"" complaints I have is that they should take a note out of Dokkan's book and up some of the rates for five star units, even though most every other rarity has some form of usability due to upping their max level limit and levelling abilities/skills up. Would recommend if you want just a long-term style game, or are a fan of the Fate/Stay Night series as a whole",positive

"Solid game, but as a veteran of other, better gacha games (Granblue fantasy, Azur Lane, Arknights) the battle system leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the characters are great though, the writing is entertaining and it does satisfy the only reason I picked the game up, which is to learn the backstory of the various characters. Def needs an auto-battle function though, as the fighting is a slow, laggy chore.",positive

The battle system is fairly simple, and as a fan of turn based combat in RPGs I've always gotten at least some enjoyment out of it. On the negative side, the game more or less requires extensive grinding to clear event shops and get materials which some may dislike, as well as the low gacha rates.",positive

Game up until that point would have been exceedingly difficult if not for the broken support system.

Just doesn't feel worth it. I quit.",negative
"It's a PvE gacha. Free-to-play users can experience all the content without spending any money. Rates for 5-stars are low (less than 1% with no pity system), but the free content is very viable.

"I'll be honest and say that the game feels very outdated in comparison to other gacha games. Its not a bad game, the game has one of the more well written stories ( some parts from Nasu ). The characters are very interesting and cute ( Im biased to fate characters however ). Apart from that the game is very harsh. SQ is hard to come by after finishing the story chapters ( more are soon to come in future updates ) and the gacha system is very unforgiving. UI is pretty slow with loads taking ages.",positive

"I've tried starting this game over 4 times now cause I love the Fate series. Story is good gameplay is ok, but gacha is terrible. I decided to try it again since i saw the new years gacha event with guaranteed 5* (which i've never had one before), only to realize after downloading the game again its locked behind paid gacha gems and not the regular gems you attain from pushing content. Only play if you're ok with spending dumb money, or ok with only using 3* characters",positive
"There needs to be a Guaranteed Sr with the rolls. I have decent luck but some people can spend hundreds without even a single Sr drop. Rates are terrible on summoning, Quartz feels too overpriced. Other then those complaints, I feel like the game has a solid story, fun gameplay, and lovable characters. The biggest downfall about the Ascension system is how hard it can be at times to get the Materials needed, but there are very good solutions as well being to just up the drop chance.",positive
I'd give it 5 stars but I lost all my progress! It's just frustrating I got servants that I'll probably never have again! But it's still a good game that's why I didn't give it 1 star. Keep up the good work anyway,positive

"If not for the gatcha, I'd rate it a full 5 stars. The story is unique and great (I love Dr. Roman's comments), and the battle system is strategic and immersing. Edit: for everyone who's complaining about the gatcha, this is how most gatcha games make money. Looking at it from afar with the level up system in mind, it makes more sense to not hand out servants so easily. I only wish they made it easier to level up craft essences and hand out more (free) Saint Quartz when completing missions.",positive
All hail DW!!!,positive
"I love this game, it has a great story (At least from chapter 6 on), the gamplay is fun and Every character is usable so there are low rarity servants who can compete with 5 stars (Cu, Arash, Hans... ).

The only bad thing I've experienced with this game is the horrible gacha rates, which are, admittedly, a non-issue. There are so many freebies that it's hard to complain. If gacha is a concern, then wait for the occasional guaranteed 5* summons. Just have fun and don't expect to obtain every waifu that comes out. Less disappointment that way.",negative

"Voice acting is amazing. Gameplay is turn based, easy to follow and you can customize your team of servants to your liking. Each servant has a specialty and class that both helps and hinders. leveling is fairly easy. Also dialogie bubbles is premade, you can also revisit to see diff dialogue. The downside is the crazy hard pulls. The Events make it more interesting, so grinding is a must and it's worth to level up your characters completely. Highly recommend this game.",positive
"very exciting, the stories, servants, quest. like learning an alternative to history, with great depictions of legends, myths.",positive
Could never understand the popularity,negative
"Unique battle system, some say its luck reliant but team composition and strategy really factors in here. It is a gacha game, but plenty of lower rank units are good for lategame, this helps because of the rates. 5* is not required but it helps, you can use units from your friends. Excellent story as well even for non-Fate fans. Customer service is good, couldn't open mine one time and they responded with a solution a little later. Nitpick - the animation for some units are not yet updated.",positive

"The drop rate for 5 star servants is completely ridiculous. The fact that you have to normally defeat 81 enemies to get 1 saint quartz is stupid. I love the fate series. I can understand low rates but I can't be the only one that gets mad when I see a 5 star essence instead of a Servant with ""increased drop rate"" I dont mind farming but it needs to be better and better log in rewards. Dragon Ball Legends and Bleach Brave souls might have similar drop rates but it's easier to get the currency.",positive

There is a lot I want to say about this game massive fate fan but I will keep this brief *The gotcha is one of the worst I've ever experienced *It definitely needs better account binding *AP systems like the one fate go has are archaic definitely needs a rework *Leveling characters is very grindy how much you'll find this a problem will vary by your own tastes The only good part of this game is that it's part of the fate series if it didn't have the fate name it would have died long ago,positive

"Compared to other games, this game has a LOT of room for improvement. The resources are mediocre, the currency for summoning rare characters are not only scarce, but expensive and the chances of getting rare characters or cards are abysmal. That said, the developers could improve many visual, story (and even grammar) aspects of the game. You need to do a lot farming too. Otherwise, it is ok... if I'm to invest money in this game, at least five me a AAA quality game.",positive

Very solid game overall. Good story. Good gameplay mechanics. It keeps you occupied for long periods of time while enjoying what the game has to offer. The game is also easily clearable with the free units available in the fp gacha which is good for the f2p players. Only minor issue is how the gacha system works and the low rates but as I said before d main story can easily be cleared with the free units.,positive

Terrible rates putting me off. Repeated grindjng. Games are stingy with summoning currency,negative
"Good art, bad game. The devs have never heard of the word ""balance"" and it shows. Combat ""difficulty"" is a pure numbers game, except the numbers are entirely wrong. You can walk into a battle less than half the recommended level of your party and get steamrolled. It's clear the game is designed for you to drop a few THOUSAND dollars to get a team of 5 star units right away, or block you from progressing. I am not exaggerating btw, drop rate is 1% for a 5 star, and one pull is 5 dollars.",negative

"Very fun and easy to get into. Will take time though. Progression is linear. Recommended to reroll for a character you like. All units are good. Events are fun and story is well written in some parts. But the gacha currency is given out very sparsely. Hard to get specific character without whaling. <1% rate and all that. Mobile gacha so grind hell. Combat uninspired and no auto. ""That's hell you're walking into."" -Some nameless red mama",negative

Still haven't gotten him, but that isn't really an issue. My issue is that it does take time to load sometimes, but that's already a problem on my end. Grinding can take long, but it's reasonable enough if you grind multiole things. Can't say gacha odds suck either, since I got a 4* and a 5* in a 10 summon once. Story is best.",negative

ok let me start off by saying my main problem with this game everyone on my team is legit just taking up space except my Heracles and my partner character. mash is basical a buff monkey and after the second singularity the difficulty spikes   ok with that out of the way my second problem is the stupid and i mean absolutely stupid gatcha rates i play a lo of these types of games and this game's system is by far the worst if you want something thats actually good to play with in this game or whats called a 4* or higher servant you have a 4% chance of actually pulling one. the rest is basical garbage or waifu fodder  another huge problem is that team members actually are pointless unless they are 4* because you do not receive enough exp boosters thingys even if you grind the daily missions that give you tons this is probably the main design flaw. with members that do nothing you are basically forced not to use 3*s a example of a game who made teams actually have a point is a game like puzzles and dragons where your team is not for some reason separated like in this one now here's my last problem the game is boring the gameplay is nonexistent i could complain more but theirs no space,negative

"The game is overall fun. The graphics are nice and the game is simple. Honestly, the drop rates really are quite annoying but it's not really necessary to get 5‚òÜ servants. The loading isn't as long as some make it to be. Just press the screen to know if it's really loading and, of course, try to get a better connection. The game takes patience. Not only in the loading screen but also with getting stronger and levelling up. This isn't a pay to win game. They want you to grind for your items.",positive

"Game is decent with a really nice amount of things. Has good art, graphics, animations and a wide variety of characters to choose from. Unlike any other gacha game, there is no ""fodder"" characters. Literally every character is viable from 1* to 5* characters as long as you invest in skills and levels. Each and every character will be useful at some point or another. Just make sure you have a good team comp to make up for strengths and weaknesses. Make sure to do events to.",positive

"Overall this game breathes a fresh new air for both new and old Fate series fans, It has a Great Story, Amazing Character Design and Fun Gameplay but the only downside is the grind for saint quartz and the low gacha rates but for me its a great game for fans of the series and rpg gamers alike(Please be more generous with benefits and bonuses like in the Japanese Server)thats all and thanks.",positive
Loading times are too long for me. Not worth it.,negative
"An absolute joke, this is a game where you can spend thousands of dollars and not get a character that's supposedly ""rate up"". A game full of cucks that laugh and meme their own masochistic spending and disappointment with pathetic jokes to justify it. The only reason this game gets by with such dispicable monetization is because of the IP it's based on, hiding the best looking and most desired characters behind a less than 1% chance to get them. The gameplay is aged and repetative.",positive
My previous phone broke a year ago and a friend decided to try and get me back into the game.

Whatever you get on you first two x10 pulls, you are technically married to the charcater until you get a 5* which is as difficult as epic sevens but they have a pity system. The currency to summon are given scarcely. And the load times to get in and out of battle are way too long.

OK I will be frank the game Is very boring I had the game for 2 years and I barely made it past tutorial the drop rates are the worst when it says double rate up its a lie getting quartz takes for ever I rarely log in I log in like once every 2 months and that's it the log In bonus is bad and useless items and the game should have a auto mode for story mode but the devs said it won't have auto mode another reason to not get the game if you just Want a reading simulator than get this game,negative

A great game and fun story. The only downside is the expensive average price you have to pay for the good rarity servants as the odds are just too low. I would much rather just pay flat out prices for servants. like seriously hear me. I'm willing to pay expensive flat prices for servants that I want. I won't pay another cent unless I'm getting exactly what I want,positive

"I think the game is great personally i like the combat, the visuals and the idea of fighting with my favorite characters because i think you can beat the game with anyone given enough effort. However the gatcha system on the other hand is rage inducing with the sheer amount of craft essence that plauges the gatcha with a higher get chance that i feel like is lying to me about the rates, as i keep going through the campaign i do most side events for quartz just to wast my effort getting essence",positive
"Personally im a huge fan of Fate series so the concept of a game based off it was exciting however after I downloaded it my love of Fate died a little I expected it to be rather original gameplay but i feel like it's just recycled games with an original story ""Sort of"" i would have loved it if they put actual effort into making a masterpiece instead of following trending game layouts my honest opinion this game needs a full RE-BOOT and more originality in the gameplay",positive

"Gameplay and story is great problem is the terrible gacha drop rates, i heard some players saved up to more than 500+ and still get nothing, if you don't have any strong will in not getting what you want then i dont recommend you this game",negative
"This game is well designed in terms of function and the story is unique, but the gacha rates are way too miserable and abysmal for how long and difficult it is to acquire game currency for summoning characters. Nobody should spend hundreds of saint quartz for nothing new or useful at all. The fact an entire singularity can barely scrape up enough for a single 10 summon is ridiculous. I used to really enjoy this game, but the work is not proportionate to the reward if there even is one.",negative

One of a kind game where real money isn't really needed to beat powerful bosses. The only reason one would spend money is having the desire to collect characters(waifus/husbandos). Great strategy game that would challenge a player's team building. Ex. A 90+Lvl boss can be beaten by just the right team if one would devise a strategy. Further examples can be seen in youtube videos of several creators. Some showcasing the usefulness of less rare servants.,positive
The suffer,negative
"Just be cautious, this game has a terrible gacha system, the only way to have a chance of summoning something you want is via buying the summoning items ( example 20 tickets and 200 qartz, no 5 star) each 10 roll being 30 qartz, the final singularity is also the most challenging so far, besides that a nice game.",positive

"A top tier in the story department. The writing keeps me motivated to grind for the next upgrades and progress. The good sound and art helps enhance that experience.

I have to fork over $100 if there's a servant I want because there's no other real way to earn saint quartz. Even if I do fork over the money the odds that I'll get someone good are slim to none.

It is honestly a great game, that can get grindy, but is fun to pick up every now and again.",positive

"For some ppl who see the gacha of FGO to be a worst thing, then youre wrong. I am a F2P (free to play) user in this game, and currently i owned 8 SSR servants, knowing that i only started playing around 4 months ago. One of my servants (Merlin) is already NP3. There is no bad luck in this game, just a strategy on how or when you will pull your rolls.",negative

I'm happy to spend on servants, but not on progression. This looks like how it's going to be for the rest of the game. I feel it's going to cost me roughly $300.00 just to beat the game.

The game is very entertaining. But the system they employ for gaining new characters and craft essences (character equipment) is an abysmal let down. By no means are you even likely to get anything new let alone the character you want. I've played the game for years and put a reasonable amount of money into the game as well. So whilst the gameplay and content they do give you is very nice and certainly entertaining. I wouldn't expect to play with many or any of the characters you like.,positive

I can live with the RnJesus gachapon and the grind for level and materials. What I can't take is that the game will tell you to get a newer phone and a home Wi-Fi rather than cellular data.

I could perhaps understand a few days delay but Android 10 has been out for months now. The fact that the devs recommend not updating to a more secure os version in order for people to play is ridiculous.",positive
"The story has it's low points, some singularities are easily worse than others. But even playing the game both casually, and pretty hardcore, I've found myself enjoying it a lot. The gameplay is simple enough that a literal toddler (a friend of mine's child) could play while their parents made food. Yet the optimization of combat mechanics and skill usage leave a surprisingly high skill cap. Plus, it's fate. So I really like that part too.",positive

Overall a really great game when it comes to all the characters and story I love everything about it but I'm pretty sure you already know when it comes to the gacha part that's where everyone has somethings to say and I'll say this give us more of a chance to actually get rare stuff like 4 or 5 stars a little easier the gacha rates are too low,positive

"I like this game. I played since launch until today. It's got an interesting plot, interesting characters, and very funny moments. However, it's clear the game is made to prey on people's gambling habits. Other games have ""pity"" systems in case of bad luck. This doesn't, because why would it? People spend money as it's an IP that they recognize, and whenever you have bad luck, it's ""just how it is."" But things won't change because you follow JP.

"Fun game that's more engaging than most mobile titles. There is a minor strategy element and there is no auto battle option which is a plus. Some people will tell you that they enjoy using common rarity servants, but this game first and foremost is a gacha. Your goal and main enjoyment is to collect and max the servants you think are nice (collecting typically 4 and 5 star). The rates on 4 and 5 star rarity are abysmally low, and the cost in USD of the quartz currency to roll the gacha is high.",positive

"Good story, good graphics, easy to get game mechanics, item drop rate far worst than their gacha drop rate, don't expect np skip but the recent issue over their 24hr maintenance shows subpar management and lack of foresight when their maintenance got extended for more than 12hr. No amount of quarts, apples or ticket, etc can replace the log ins that were reset. They have no contingency or fail safe in such issues and it might/will happen again in the near future so log in count is useless.",negative

Over all it's a great game the only thing I dislike about the game is how many quarts they give u for completing one quest I believe they should raise it to at least 2 or 3 quarts because with getting just one I would have to comple 30 quest just to get the ten rolls and that's a lot of time considering that there's not even 30 main quests in the singularities,positive

Even lower rarity character can be useful if you know how to build the right team. But on god the drop rates are terrible. üòÅ,positive
I can't even launch the app,neutral
"Doesn't work for pixel 3 xl, crashed just by starting it up with nothing running in the background",neutral
Amazing rate it 20 stars,positive
"Really enjoyable game, the lack of pvp make it better because there is not p2w, the rates are a joke for ssr and Sr, but you can clear the content with low rarity units. Beware, this is hell you are walking into it",negative
Straight up the worst gacha rate and pity system I've seen. God I love this game tho please send help,positive
"Crashes a lot of times, goes ""connection lost"" even when I have stable Internet connection. The game will not respond after pressing ""Retry"" on ""connection lost"" most of the times. Frustrating experience",negative
Rate up is a lie! The game is very versatile on free units however. As usual though lucky draws 4-5 * stars make the game easier. My first round wasnt the luckiest but second time is the charm!,positive
Wow that's awesome üëçüòÄüëçüòÄüëçüòÄüòÄ,positive

"Promises were broken, setting an unfortunate precedent. Otherwise, it's meh.",negative
"Took an extended break to focus on life, returned to an update which seems to have cleared my data, maybe because I downloaded the game on a different platform and updated here?.. RIP Okita and Mordred regardless. Overall okay game but goddamn am I devastated that I can't get Okita now.",negative
"Sell your soul to the gacha, get waifus. 5/5",neutral
I love the Fate series. But this game needs some serious optimization! Any kind of loading takes a long time and takes the momentum of both the game and story down a lot.,positive
"Deceptive and terrible NA management have destroyed any credibility that English translated Type Moon products have left. Claim that bugs are features, lie to community about intents and practices, and completely shutters out any and all feedback. Game is fun but NA handling has ruined it. Play JP instead or just read story translations online.",positive
"Took a month to update for Android 10 (zero compensation for missed events) so I figured I'd wait another month to update my review. I will say it is a ridiculously fun and addictive game, but the gacha rate as well as the expensive of it is horrid. The game is not worth paying a dime on unless it is the garunteed gacha. I will leave it at 3 stars, and will only give more if the gacha gets better and/or the devs actually begin to care about their playerbase.",positive
It sucked,negative
Love it thank you,positive
"It made me love the Fate series even more. Interesting and good story with quirky, funny and badass moments. Gameplay is good and pretty unique. The gacha rates are impossible with no real type of pity system, but you can use the freebies and others you get to do everything, unlike other games where the SSR's end up being necessary.",positive
"It's an amazing game, but with the recent update, it just pauses on the loading screen right before the main menu. It's really pissing me off and don't wanna uninstall the game to lose all the progress I've already put into it",negative
It's cool. Rates are kinda stupid low though.,negative
"I must have farmed almost 1,000 saints quartz playing this game and I have rolled nothing but 3 star servents and crafts essence. It got to the point where I didn't feel like playing anymore. One day the mobile game demanded a human sacrifice for a 5 star. I thought it was stupid but so many craft essence. So I tried it... My first born son is what it wanted. The mobile game accepted the offer and when I rolled, I saw it, a rainbow stream of light. It was a 5 star... 5 star craft essence...",negative
This exactly a FREE-TO-PLAY game...but you have to PAY to have fun. ^_^,positive
Amazing game üôåüôå Love the series,positive
"After an update, can no longer open the app.",negative
"I'm hooked on this game. It's simple to grasp at first and has more to it once you learn the mechanics of the game. The rate up banners have bad drop rates for higher rarity servants, but that's gatcha for ya.",negative
Grate game,neutral
Best game ever!!!,positive
"Simply, the best. If you're looking for a way to kill some time and read some good VN. Fate never disappoints. You're in for a ride for everytime they give apologems and free quartz. Really not stingy for gifts and rewards. Been playing for almost a year and still hooked up ever since.",positive

Anyone who contributes to the cancer that is nu-TypeMoon deserves death by exposure. They're so retarded that they probably wouldn't even be able to tell they were dying in the first place.,negative
Best moble game ever very addicting cant stop playing,positive
Does not start.,neutral
Very entertaining storyline ... charming character design... easy grind but still makes a challenging game specially on events and boss fights ... recommended for anime and jrpg lovers,positive
"Amazing story and characters but is ruined by low drop rates on everything. They use horrid micro transactions that turn you into an addict for trying to get your favorite characters""just a little more money so I can try and get this character"". It would be fine if a 187 pack of saints quartz was like 25 bucks but its 80, which is way to much for a 1% chance to get a character that's a 5 star not even to get the one you want. It's kinda sad that this is a great game but it just about money.",negative
"Great game overall, amazing graphics and story never fails to keep me interested. There are many events continuously being introduced which keeps the content fresh and interesting. The characters are lovable and unique in their own ways, great game! üëç",positive
"It's okay, I guess. Kinds grindy though, wish I could turn off or skip the noble phantasm animations. Also really needs an auto battle option, would make farming a lot easier.",positive
"I've played this for a little over 500 days now. 1st off, I love the Fate franchise. If it didn't have Fate on it I wouldn't have tried it at all. The game is simple in comparison to other gachas however, there is love behind most of the designs, animations, story, and events. Can be very grindy/Off putting to beginners but very pleasing to max out those .PNG waifus/husbandos. It suffers from a very low-rate gacha and poorly written beginning (1st 4 singularities) but gets amazing onwards.",positive
It's where all your favorite gacha memes come from.,positive
This game is amazing Good work creaters keep it up,positive
How do I recover my old account on this game? I give it 2 star for repeat back from scratch.,neutral
Honestly it didnt seem that good at first. But then i realized how fun it was in battle and interaction! I love how there's even a bond for masters and servants,positive

"gameplay is boring, too much loading screen and the loading time takes too long.",negative
"After two whitewashings, I'm officially done with this app and I want nothing to do with it",positive
The main thing i didnt like about this is the update time it takes about a day for mine to update and when i start playing it wasnt worth it and it was a waste of time,negative
"I use samsung s9 plus and i can't open this game anyway, can you fix it?",neutral
"A very good and addictive game. The only problem is the gacha drop rate. Other than that, definitely a very good game and a good story",positive
"Bad rates for 5 star, but game is still fun.",positive
Broken for over two months with no end in sight. Doesn't even launch anymore.,negative
Day 7 player here with ~5000 in the game and hit 850 logins. Sadly I got an overdrive version of the crash that's been happening recently stopping me from logging in for 5 days straight. Devs told me to go wait for the next big patch or get a new phone. So I'm moving on to azur lane. Best of luck to you fgo.,positive
Very Great!,positive
"Unable to open the game after install, I am positive my device supports the game. Any help?",positive

Love it and best part is the game has the characters from the Netflix series of fate.,positive
"The story and interactions are the main reason I play this game. The combat system aspect is fine but can get stale at times, the grind is pretty tedious, and it took me 4 months to get my first 5 star servant, but I do recommend the game. Definitely promotes paying players, but being f2p is very much possible as long as you put in the work.",positive
"Amazing. Great story, only moderately monetized (for a mobile game), all characters can be viable, and of course waifus. Been playing this game since it came out and still love it.",positive
Entertaining and addictive,positive
"Very great, the part that confuses me is how to get rewards from the quest I do",positive
10/10 gomenasorry not so gomenasorry,neutral
"I love this game, even though it treats users like garbage with terrible gacha rates and a heartless lack of summoning resources. If you're a fan of the Fate franchise you can find some of your favorite characters here, but don't expect to get most of them without spending. And in some cases, spending a lot.",positive

I love the fate series in general. The gatcha is a bit of a problem tho. Just save for one or two servants and you will be fine. It also feels as if the servant picks you instead of the other way around.,positive

Great game. I enjoy all the characters and the customer support team is awesome. When a problem happens they get it fixed.,positive
It is really fun and not boring,positive
"Very pay to win unless you're incredibly lucky, like I've been. The story is a great balance of everything. It will have your waifu, or you'll find one. That's really just how it is.",positive
"Game itself is fine. Gacha experiences differ. However, inane design where USB Debug must be disabled for the game to run, or suffer incessant attempts of bug report. Requires me force closing the app from Memories each time I turn back on USB Debug. Unlikely to see the game accept Android advanced features in fear of cheating probably, since game doesn't sync up and is tied to the DEVICE.",negative
"Fun enjoyable game, would love if certain things were easier to get but that's part of the game",positive

Amazing game! Each Chapter has very interesting and entertaining stories with unique and memorable characters. Historical heroes of all times all clash against one another! Events bring awesome or sometimes funny stories to the table. Its HIGHLY likely youve seen a mayority of these female characters in the websites where you...battle your demon tower. Music is amazing ~ Free to Play is possible easily. Farming to stay afloat is true doe.,positive

"Okay so I just figured out that this game can not let me repeat myself can not run with USB Debugging on, if it's on the app just won't open. Glad I figured it out, can't wait to have Mashu Kyrielight in my team! Really wish there was a Facebook or Google Play Games option to sign in to save data. The game was acting wack, so had to delete it and I had my transfer code never used once. I tried signing in with the transfer code and nothing happened, told me it doesn't work.

"I love this game but it just doesn't seem to work anymore. I'm on a pixel 3axl. Load time for game is 5+ minutes on Wi-Fi, and that's if it decides to connect to the servers.

"It's a good gameplay experience. However on the pixel 3 it crashes now quite frequently, something I've not seen ever on the Japanese version of the game. It's basically not worth even playing on the device right now.",positive
"The micro-transactions are pricey, but even F2P, the game is a great RPG experience, and I feel good about supporting the developers financially given how much I've played the game. Just make sure your ratio of playtime to money spent isn't too lopsided towards the latter, and you'll have a good time!",positive
Personally my favorite gacha. Know that this is a gacha but the gameplay and story are great. Plus if you stay long enough you can begin to see and understand the depth of strategy available.,positive
"The game was censored without so much as a warning nor an apology, despite promises to the contrary. Over eight months later and despite numerous complaints, there has still yet to be so much as a statement about it. Furthermore, multiple in-game events that were present in the Japanese version were skipped entirely for no reason. The developers are deaf to concerns and criticism. Do not play this game if you value honesty, transparency, or integrity in a developer, as you won't find them here.",negative

"It's a solid game, dont expect to get new characters constantly but they give you solid characters most events that help fill out your teams. Not the game to play if you just like spinning the gatcha wheel but definitely something to pass time.",positive
Best gacha hell ;),positive
"Unironically my favorite mobile game of all time. The game feels like a proper RPG while still being convenient to play from my pocket! The gacha rates are draconian but honestly, the game is balanced just fine to be entirely clearable with nothing but the freebies anyway, so even if you don't hit the jackpot with the big SSR prizes, you will still win!",positive
I'm addicted. Please send help. :p,positive
This isn't a game its a money sink. Combat is bland and rng and doesn't understand basic principles nes RPGs did better. Ie random encounters resouces drain. Fgo's are filler and waste your time. You get one interesting fight for 200 + no auto. Devs refuse to fix anything. Like special skip or craft essences in pools to make summoning feel bad. The gatcha is just awful and ruins what might be a mediocre game to garbage. If you like fate watch a playthrough for the story and music avoid this.,negative
Gacha for this game just isn't worth it and it sucks since I love the series so much but I've used probably a good thousand of the in game currency and have been playing for almost a year with only 2 five star characters to show for it. I understand having gacha be stacked against you but if you literally aren't getting anything what's the point in playing?,positive
Love the game great game keep up the good job,positive
"Gacha gacha. The game itself works great. Gacha. The story is well written and interesting for the most part, but due to the nature of the game there is a lot of fluff and battles boating it to about 10x their optional length. Gacha. The actual gameplay loop is fun enough but having to sit through unskippable videos for Noble Phantasms (super moves) is pretty mind numbing. Gacha All that said, this game is inherently gacha-y. A lot of side quests and even the main stories are basic manipulation.",positive
Good game and all but it's pretty rare to get a really good character,positive
Hell of a fun game but the file got too big for my phone so I have to stop playing sadly.,negative
Fantastic mobile rpg.,positive
Heavy-handed changing of dialogue in translation makes this game less than it could've been. Adding memes and ruining characters is horrible. Game performance on Android is the worst I've ever seen. Game is constantly 2 years behind and nothing is ever a surprise with no hope of ever closing the gap to something more reasonable. I really want to love this game but in the end it's trash hard carried by fate.,negative
Great game with so much content,positive
Worst game I've ever played,negative
"don't you go spending those 3 saint quartz all at once lil johnny! F:GO is a great game. But the gacha will eat you if you let it. As long as you're not too discouraged by not being able to roll for big 5* star servants, the 'wellfare' servants should treat you well.",positive

its a nice game but its data backup system is a bit dated it doesn't back up to a server or to google or anywhere sadlythe only way to recover is through a code you must get before something happens to your device if you don't you may have a chance at getting your account back by contacting the support and you may not edit still no better way of backing up accounts and to be fair they have had plenty of time,positive

Very fun and very addicting,positive
"Highly addictive game but hours of fun! My gacha luck has really improved and I enjoy all the events. You really do need to spend money in order to get those rare 5 star servants as I've come to realize having gotten 5 already just by buying quartz. I just wish you could speed up the battles alot more as grinding becomes tedious and the fastest in game speed is not fast enough. Other than that, the gameplay is simple enough and the graphics are great! I would recommend.",positive

"Top notch story, best charater-design, the soundtrack is okay and the game mechanic is decently simple, however, can be challenging if needs to be. One special thing about the game is that even the low-rarity characters are useful and competent. No PvP = relaxing. There are plenty of ways to farm premium currency to compensate for disheartening pull-rate. Being a gacha-based game veteran, I can easily give this one a 5-star.",positive

"I'm not giving this game one star because it's bad. I love this game, the characters, the story, and the gameplay. I'm giving this one start because of the terrible support when it comes to data recovery. I play this game extremely casually and am sometimes absent from the game for very long periods of time. I have however, invested quite a lot of money into this game because I like it and would like to see it continue. HOWEVER, recently I had some phone issues and was unable to play because the app crashed on startup so I uninstalled it, not knowing that doing so would cause me to possibly lose my account. After re-installing the game I tried to get access back but found that I had no way of doing so and contacted support. To my dismay, I found that their data recovery service is entirely reliant on a user remember many different random things about their account, which, if you do not play the game religiously or remember every detail of your account will cause you to lose your data and start all over. This seems unacceptable to me when so many other games sync with either an account that requires a log in or simply with some other cloud service that saves your game data. While they were thankfully able to restore my data because I had played recently, had that not been the case I could have lost my data. At least in my part I will not be making any more purchases in this game until I can see some sort of resolution for data recovery that is efficient and not reliant on the user's memory. This is frankly an outdated and inefficient method of data recovery.",positive
Gave this 5 stars. Because my luck is great at the game fufu. But seriously dont spend money if ur after the story. Only use money if u wanna get ur waifu or husbando with certainty. Its fun for me since i am just for the story haha.,positive
good!!,positive
The biggest pay to win game ive ever played.,positive
Amazing game for people who enjoy the Fate series.,positive

"Fun game, if it could actually connect to the server...",positive
"It's alright, not the best mobile game, story is good at moments with some nice events every year. Personally I prefer epic seven and all it's quality of life features that fate go does not have.",positive
"Alright so not gonna lie. This game is literal gacha hell if you're f2p and get too immersed. Either that or your luck's just garbage, 1 of the 3. I've played for about 5 months now and still haven't gotten a 5 star, though the 4 star character's are generally alright. Biggest rule of thumb from me is definitely to not get too confident, because trust me. You'll be dissapointed a lot if you think you'll instantly have everyone you want.",positive
"Even though its a game of chance this game makes a great job at making everyone at the game good, useful, and a viable choice to use. It may not seem like a f2p friendly game but it is since even 1* servants have their use",positive
Bad the game all about gambling you pay like 79$ all you get depends on luck most of time i got bad cards i don't why any anime game that has free to play is just grabage game.,positive

"My favorite phone game by far. Good characters, good stories for the most part. People complain about the rates, but honestly after a year of playing without spending, I'm doing just fine. Only complaint is the horrible support that was given upon the release of Android 10. Missed a month and a half of game play and routine, but so far that's the only issue I've encountered.",positive
It was exhilirating,neutral
"Overall a great game. The only con for me is that it loads too long. And once you lose your game data, if on a previous phone, you have to start over from scratch on the new device. Kind of blows because this game is time consuming-- also not to mention if you've spent money.",positive

"Cash grab, and greedy devs. The game to a certain point is heavy to run despite having a very dull and annoying UI, stupid and VERY low quality combat animation. And the worst of all about this game is straight up using EXTREME fanService (almost pornographic) to keep you attached, and suck your wallet dry, basically relying on your sexual addiction instead the enjoyment that this game could provide (it couldn't for me). The story is pretty good tho...that's THE ONLY good thing about this game.",negative
Only for whales. Don try this game if u r not willing to sell your liver to get the heroes you want.,positive
Won't even open if you downloaded the new Android 10 update. Ridiculous how they haven't fixed it yet.,negative
I accidentally deleted the game and when I reinstalled it I lost all of my previous progress. Is there are way to get it back? Because I have no desire to play from the beginning again.,negative
NICE,positive
"A Fate Game....I'm Starting To Get Into ""Fate"", Which Lead Me To This Game. I Will Say That Finding A Character From ""Fate"" That You Like As A Character To Use In This Game Is Very Important, Since Once You Get That Character, Everything Else You Get Via Gacha Ends Up Being A Bonus...The Only Thing I Wish Were Implemented Are A Pool Of 4 Or 5 Star Characters That The Player Gets To Choose From Instead Of Uninstalling And Reinstalling The Game For A Certain 4 Star Character.",positive

It's been 2 weeks and no word on any fixes. I'll change my review when they fix so I can play again. Update: I can play after a month! This game is an OG gacha salt and pepper. It has classic turn base combat. The story is very anime, but if it's your jam you will enjoy this sandwich. Don't take the rolls seriously.",positive

Sell your soul to gacha. You'll get a great story and 3*s in exchange.,positive
Very engaging without requiring a massive time sink. Able to be played without spending any money without sacrificing the experience at all.,positive
"The game is amazing, the summon system maybe a bit dettering but the game is perfect",positive
"Amazing over all, just wish there were even slight rewards for fateverse knowledge or something. That would get people to really know fate. Also slightly higher chances or some of the 4‚òÜ and 5‚òÜ",positive

"This review is written by a casual player with mid-end spec devices. The game have awesome story, characters, and well-balanced. High rarity servants just serves as the dev's income as well as a difficulty reducer for the player. The sad part is, the game's efficiency in terms of gameplay and game engine. It takes almost a minute to load a quest on my 3GB RAM device, 2-5 secs for scene transition or enemy spawns, and no auto-clear system. A big problem for casuals/standard phone users.",negative

Great game! Looking forward for more Nasuverse fun!,positive
"So I'll start with the downside, and it's one that most ""free"" mobile games have and that it that it is very P2W. However the upside to that is that it isn't as bad as it could be. The game gives you Saint Quartz (The currency used to summon) every day as well as weekly challenges to earn more. Microtransactions are an option I never like, but it never feels necessary. The game has a pretty good story as well as great gameplay! Servants are addictive to collect, highly recommend for any Fate fan",positive
"Waifus are real, I'm just glad to be able to roll for my favourite characters.",positive
Great. game,positive
"A good game, but I am of those people who don't like gratuitous cut scenes. Before and after every fight! Condensing the number of cut scenes would help people stick it out imo.",negative
"Gameplay is ok at best, just a standard turn based mobile game. I'd advise only playing if you're a huge fate fan if not I would steer clear as the gacha rates in this game are unforgiving compared to other gacha games.",positive

"Best Game I played ! Graphics and Animations were great, storyline is the greatest and battle strategy is challenging :3",positive
Has a good story and an amazing cast of characters. Gameplay is fun but gets repetitive and the gacha rates are insidious. Highly recommended but play at your own risk as their premium currency is very expensive and servant drop rates are so brutally low you can spend thousands and still not get the character you want.,negative
I just like the game,positive

"For a company that makes $1.8 billion a year from addicted waifu collectors, the lack of immediate Android 10 support is inexcusable. This happened with Android 9 as well. If they make this much money, why can't they hire developers to react and anticipate quicker? This is the only app I have that won't work with Android 10. It's embarrassing, Aniplex. Get your stuff together or I'm pulling the plug on this already geriatric game.",neutral

"I don't care for over-hyped things but it pops up everywhere so I thought I'd give it a try. Low and behold, it crashes as soon as it opens. Looking through the other reviews and how long this has been happening for other players, the silence is an implication of the developer's fervent refusal to fix this issue. Actual customer service seems to be non-existent. I might, though it's not likely, change the review depending on how long it takes them to actually work on this issue from now onwards.",negative

Doesn't run on Android 10. So I can't tell you how good it is.,positive
The biggest problem I have will always be drop rates even if I'm just going after a 4 star I know I'll never get the one I want then the event for a four star went up and I couldn't use the item,negative
I was pretty far in the game and I just got the servant astolfo so I was really happy too. but then my phone broke and I can't get back into my old account on fgo.

Wanted to get back in for the Halloween Event, but like a lot of reviews on here it looks like the game won't even launch after updating to Android 10.

"The story is very extensive and the character art is really nice. The biggest downside to this game is the insane difficulty of acquiring 5 star characters. Overall, this game is great if you have a lot of time to kill and get lucky summoning. As for me, I seem to lack both of those so I respectfully choose to uninstall.",neutral
"Can't even get into the game, I try to load it in and it stops",negative
"Hell, I didn't even got a chance to play the game. It just shuts down every time I open it, but the device doesn't seem that as a crash so I can't find a report or anything",negative
"It was a great game that I loved playing, however it's lack of compatibility with Android 10 is very disappointing. When it becomes patched to work on the new version of Android I would love to give a 5* review.",positive
"Fate: Grand Order's story is amazing, characters are beautifully designed and all have distinct personalities (though 4th stage ascension art for female servants can get a bit..) and it can never get boring. F2P players, like myself, won't have any problems. Unlike with other RPGs, some of FGO's lower ranked servants can still be more powerful than 4 star or even 5 star servants (Hans, Ushi, C√∫, etc.). Overall a fun story driven and F2P friendly game. Keep up the good work DW!!",positive
As a free to play person im very disappointed and every time I I draw with 30 Saint quartz all i get is craft essence for my four to five stars instead of a servant so im giving you a one star. You should do it improve on your draw rates or separate servants from craft essence drawls and give the players a choice whether they want to draw for crafts essence or servants,positive
"Loved playing this game, but the lack of urgency in the compliance for Android 10 is just plain unacceptable. Clearly the developer is not interested in moving forward with supporting the game.",positive
"Been playing since launch, love this game to death lol",positive
"I have to say for a game that has a 4.4 star it sure does keep it's words. I installed the game pretty quickly but as it completed installing and getting ready to press turn app to launch it, boom!

1 star because developers still haven't white listed Android 10 leaving people vulnerable.

Others have been locked out since early August. This is unacceptable, and NA support has not been willing to disclose any sort of ETA when it will be fixed. If you really want to start, i suggest finding emulation tools to play the JP version, which not only plays on Android 10, but is more generous with currency.",positive

"Definitely the best story, gameplay, and characters of any mobile game I have ever played. It's even greater, as it manages to capture the visual novel style of the original Stay Night, while also introducing genuine gameplay and fun events. Despite annoyingly low gold rates, it is easily the best gacha game to be released, and a genuine accomplishment for Type Moon.",positive
My fav,positive
Was really enjoying the game until a few days ago it's started crashing every 5-10 minutes with an error code that no one has ever heard of. I've tried everything I can think of to fix the issue and so far the only help I've gotten from support was basically to buy a different phone despite everyone else with my phone saying it works fine for them and it was working fine for me before.,positive

"I've been playing since launch (around 2 years) and heres my basic one line review: FGO is a good game, just not a great one. Lemme explain. The gameplay is average, story and characters are good for what they are. Its summoning rates are typical for a gacha game though it's usually touted as the worst rates. This is FINE because there isnt any significant competitive edge using rare characters in the game except friend points. And what brought this game to a 3 is support. No Android 10 update!!",positive
Total lack of Android 10 support 2 months after it's release is unacceptable and lazy.,negative
"As a weeb, this game really entertaning",neutral
Wasting my time (sometimes in a good way!) The character models are fabulous! The gameplay and story are...decent. But any fun I had grinding away for another chance to get more of the beautiful characters and maybe even one if your favorites from the many series is instantly lost when you dont get a single exciting draw again and again and AGAIN. Thankfully the horribly overpriced microtransactions were so insulting expensive that it's easy to not feel tempted to gamble your money away here.,positive

"Very well made RPG. All servants are useful as you can built a team around them. The story gets better as you progress (in my opinion). There is an anime coming on October 2, 2019 about the Babylonia singularity if you want to check out the story for that part. While 5* servants are usually better, you can still make a team around common servants. You just have to be smart with how you play. (I've been unlucky on when I wanted to roll for someone). The gacha can be bad due to the percentages.",positive

God forbid if you play this game on normal speed. The rates, well I don't really care about them. They're obviously greedy, but what game company isn't? Even at 1% rates I have 3 5 stars servants, with barely any summoning. Outside of that, the game honestly needs an overhaul for performance.",positive

Also, ""summoning"" multiple things forces you to watch a painfully slow unveiling for each individual item, which was the breaking point for me.",negative
"Its a pretty good gatcha game. However there are two big problems I have with it: A) The gatcha system has really low drop rates for how hard it is to get anything. B) The transfer codes only work once, so remember to make a new one every time you need to switch, or else you'll lose all of your progress like I did. If you like the Fate/ series, definitely check this game out.",positive
the only game app i play,positive
Super fun and always something to do. Perfect for fans of the Fate series by Type Moon,positive
Garbage this sorry excuse for a game never loaded up and forced to exit the app when it never lisded up. It's just another scam from low lifes,negative
I also love this game and can't play it after upgrading to Android 10. Sucks!!,positive
"This is a fun game. But i have a serious issue with the AI having abilities we cannot use, such as unrestricted use of skills and the fact that their noble phantasms are a GUARANTIED instant kill where we cannot instantly kill with a noble phantasm in nearly every case. If you are going to give them hundreds of thousands of HP you need to balance that by restricting their skill use by at minimum double the cooldown time of the player's equivilant skill at its level 1.",positive
Still no Android9,negative
"It's ok but I think it's going a little too ambitious when they're trying to give us the JP experience, maybe break that experience and speed up the events just like the other servers. Leave a year of gap or something, that'll be nice.",positive
Its a fun game you have to keep an eye on your servants levels and skills and upgrade them using materials you got from ether the campaign events or training areas which switch by day some events may be block by the campaign for the second campaign is on the horizon starting around dec of 2019 for the NA severer Jp is still a head. Oh ya and do not expect to get your favorite servant off the bat for that set you up for disappointment chill and use the 3 stars if you lucky to get them.,positive

It a good game from the series,positive
Top rated grossing game on the Play Store but actually unplayable since Android 10 update? It's been weeks and this is getting ridiculous. When I emailed customer service I was told not to take the Android 10 update like this is my problem and not the problem of the game company who is supposed to make sure their titles are compatible with new Android launches. Absolute joke and how you shouldn't run a game.,positive
"im a really big fan of FGO and the anime, I can't wait to start playing this game. This will be a hole new experience for me i rarely play mobile games because of how busy i am",positive
I love the game so much that i have another account with my another cp. Still one of the game in my phone for over 2 years by now. I dont know why I dont get bored playing this game even though there is a lot of moblie games out there,positive
It's very addicting and just is a good story.,positive
I cant open the game is says: the game is not available in your play environmwnt,positive
"The game was fun to play, and I had wished I still could. But since the app still hasn't been updated for almost a month now for Android 10 users I am losing interest in it. There have been many events that I have missed out on and I highly doubt they will make up for it. I have tried to contact support and have just been handed with ""there's not much we can do about it"" in an email. It's disappointing.",negative

I think it's amazing,positive
"Customer service would not allow me to recover my account even though I gave them a screenshot of my google play transactions with the email I was emailing them from with the GPA. I told them the last time I played the game and the servants I had as well. This game is dead anyways, I recommend epic 7. They have better customer service there.",positive
"I have really been enjoying the game. As with any game of this type, the RNG for character pulls can be very frustrating, but having the highest tier characters generally feels like it's more for preference than necessity. I'm glad I found Fate/GO and I'll probably enjoy it for quite some time.",positive

Great game for Fate and TYPE-MOON fans but please update this to work for Android 10! It's a major showstopper for many players!,positive
"This game is amazing. It has an incredible plot, and great gameplay. I love playing it, and when I lost my game data, the developers helped me retrieve it. If this is your first time downloading it, you need to get a data transfer code before anything else. Other than that, it is a wonderful game that I suggest you play if you have watched any of the animes.",positive

I still find it fun and I am still attached to my servants. I miss my old servants too tho, but I love my current ones as well",positive
"There is actually a lot of effort put into this seemingly cruel gatcha mobile game. the storyline is long and verbose, so if you like the classic Fate/Stay Night visual novel, you will have plenty to enjoy here. On top of that, there are endless free events going on for all levels of player, so you can jump in anytime and get a valuable character to help you through the story.",positive
It's fun and passes the time.,positive
"The more I play this game the more I appreciate how they give all players everything they need to play all content in the game, no money required. Some of the best servants in the game are on the free gatcha, and they regularly have events where you get a free 4 star servant that is usually quite powerful. Plus, even if you spend a lot of money and get a lot of 4-5 star servants, you still have to play the game to get the materials to make them useful.",positive

Evil app that i still play regardless....,negative

I don't even want to play anymore cause I had already gotten so far in the story quests.",positive
Best gatcha game ever,positive
"This app can be a pain in the ass on times because of it's chances for getting a five or four star servant, but in the end, I love it. It always makes up for things like that. I can't give it less than five stars.",positive

The rates are exactly as advertised; while I hate not pulling what I want as much as anybody else, I got exactly what I signed up for. Re: the game itself... I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who isn't a Type Moon fan already, and the story isn't up to the standard seen in a lot of other Nasuverse works, but it still offers a lot to enjoy.",positive
"never paid attention to the fate series before, but after seeing someone i follow online hype about this, i just had to check it out. and so far, i am utterly absorbed. i'm having a lot of fun and the game helps me destress. wonderful story, a variety of characters WITH voice acting, beautiful art and interesting gameplay.",positive

I still feel like I can endorse it despite all of that though, because the story and characters are so charming and pleasant that there's plenty to do and see even if you can never even get close to any of the rare characters you might want.",positive

"This is a nice game, the story is nice, the gameplay is nice and there are voices for every character in the game. Only thing is, the low chance to get a 5 star servant. But that does not bug me cus its mainly on upgrading. Nice Job!",positive
Great game. No need to spend money on the microtransactions. Just play the story and events.,positive
"NOT Pay 2 Win. In fact, the only reason you would be paying for this game is to support the game and get that certain character for yourself. The main story and events can be finished with 1-3 star servants. Speaking of events, some events gives a free 4 star Servant for compensation if you ever get unlucky with your rolls. That said, no matter how unlucky or lucky you get with your rolls, you won't find the need to compete to get the best servants available since there is no PvP.",positive
My favorite game!!!!,positive

The game's fun and the characters are great however it feels like it's not very free to play friendly and geared towards those who would invest money into this game,positive
It is a incredibly fun game that supports free to play. though if you miss a event and its rerun you have no chance to redo it... that is the only problem I can think of,positive
Love Fate and I enjoy fgo,positive
"Good story. Good and memorable historical figures made into anime characters. Simple, yet deep gameplay. Overall, a really good game with a good community. Only downside is the gacha and it's not so great rates, but the game is still very good and playable besides that.",positive
I go to update my game and it uninstalled itself what the heck,neutral
"Aside from the abysmal roll rng, the game has a solid structure. Some of the best servants in the game are given to you after completing optional events. I found the Remnant singularity arcs have better stories than the original story. I think the QoL has dramatically improved since launch and there is so much free stuff you get from login bonuses.",positive

"I have been dying to play this for a very long time ever since the Jap version came out. I'm a very big fan of the Fate series and playing this game has been the greatest enjoyment I've had recently. Good gameplay that does not rely solely on rarity but of team composition and timing of actions where one is forced to plan more than two turns in advance. Not too hard nor too easy, it is a very enjoyable tactical TRPG made to be enjoyed by both the fans of the series and gamers.",positive

"Out of all the games iv ever played on mobile, only 2 have stood out as being actually great games; Tales Of Link (Rip) and this one. FGO is a shining example of a game where being f2p isnt a death sentence. All sevants have uses from the low 1 star to the highly sought after 5 stars. Being a masdive fate fan its really cool to play this game to set combos that would never exist in universe. Thats why its a 5* game to me. Its just that great.",positive

I'm enjoying it right now to give it 4 stars. Although rates are still very bad. Not for people with horrible luck. I just offset my bad luck with more $$$. Careful not go so deep down the hole just to regret it later.,negative
Fantastic game! I like how it combines card battles with a visual novel. Impressive story and good battles too. Just wish it wouldn't crash so often. EDIT: This game crashes way too often. Lowering to 3 stars. Good luck if you have a low quality android. It's also my only game installed.,positive
Gameplay is really enjoyable and rewards high-iq team compositions even with f2p servants. Spending money is optional and the gacha rates are at least in my opinion okay. Some of the lower rarity Servants have meh animations and some of the skills did not age well at all but ytill a good game nonetheless.,positive
My daily login is ruined due to the Maintenance times so now I will never get the reward for the 7mil campaign. Not to mention the game lags way more than the Japanese version which shows little to no lag for me.,negative

The only problem with this game, it doesnt have a character selector ticket system, like week one you get a ticket, and week 3 you get a ticket. The stars are on certain weeks like first week you get a 4 star, and the third week you get a 5 star. So i hope you add this system one day.",positive
"I never expected to enjoy this game as much as I have, so much so that I have several accounts including on JP. Let me preface this by saying that this game is not pay to win and everything can be beaten as F2P with a bit of ingenuity. The story is great, and got me back into reading. I learned myths and histories of characters and places I would have never heard of otherwise. Combat is simple enough to grasp, but continues to evolve. Definitely worth your time, just don't whale.",positive

Excuse can you answer? how do you use the 7million downloads ticket that are given? pls explain in simple steps. :),positive
Great game overall but fp has almost no use so I have over a million if not over a billion so if you add a better use or just a type how many you want to summon button I'd say it's a five outta five. Also maybe add material from past events in there as a super rare drop I have a few servants being useless due to not being able to ascend them just a suggestion though.,positive
Please update this game for Android 10,positive
"The game is fun but my phone recently pushed an update to Android 10 and the game will not launch. The same exact thing happened during Android 9 launch and it took weeks for the fix. As fun as this game is, the support and service for this game is so disappointing....you'd expect so much more from the #1 grossing gacha on the market.",positive

Used 900 sq and didn't get Merlin. Rates are bad so not worth trying.,negative
I earn my 30 saint quartz and i spinned it and the game crushed and eat my quartz and i don't recieve any summoned so pls fix this and thank you,positive

The game is good. I love the story and the side stories of the characters. I cant wait until more content comes out.,positive
"Y'know it's actually not that bad if you don't include the gatcha rates. You can farm most SR servants from events and rerun and during download events you get a free SR ticket. All the servants are pretty balanced as low tier scale up 1-3. If your starting the game fresh you might see some difficulty but with this game, but the longer you play the more free stuff your going to be building up to make up for the pay wall. In the future I hope they can give out a free SSR ticket tho prob unlikely.",positive
"Why dont you add a system for every 100,000 friend points you can exchange for a single saint quartz",positive
had an issue with my account and was greeted quickly and friendly and they were more than willing to help and solve my problem. thanks again. The only actual complaint I have is the the whole transfer code. I just got a new phone and i have put plenty of money into this game and since I got a new phone I cant access my account due to not having the transfer code. If we could get like a fb sign in or a gmail or something to make it easier to recover our accounts.,positive

All games essentially work on android 10 but this one decides not to open. I know we were given notice about the incompatibility but the devs were also given advanced notice about android 10 as well. Honestly just shows how lazy the devs can be on this game.,positive

Its nice but they could make a bit easier to get summon crystals,positive
I have tried repeatedly to download and play this game to no-avail. I've confirmed that USB debugging is not on. Not sure if this is due to the recent Android 10 update. But a fix would be nice as Fate is one of the best series out right now. Edit: This is definitely due to Android 10 update. My wife had 9 still and I tried the game on her phone and it worked fine. It wouldn't work on a fresh install after I updated her phone. Let's fix this please.,positive

"It is a fun game to play, but the app itself takes up enormous amounts of space and has awful load times. It constantly requires updates which also takes up more and more space like the very hungry catapillar.

Awsome Game. Great work!,positive
I think even if your not a fan of the fate series like me you should at least try it once newcomers it's actually a really good game especially if you like gacha games and visual novels the plot of the story is 10/10 so far you really going to want to grab some popcorn once you get to the seventh and final singularity though lol so hit that install button,positive

"Been playing for close to a year now. Not rating 5 stars, since this game is not perfect. I play pretty casually and maintain loging in for daily rewards. But I've been lucky to save and get some good 5 star servants. Quartz are pretty grindy, but if you save and play casualy, free2play isnt terrible. Combats pretty fun, load times can depend on device/connection and there's a lot of story to invest with. Never gave a review before, but overall imo the game is worth trying.",positive
Good game. Rate up can be frustrating some times.,neutral
Good game amazing story and the characters are all useful but summon rates kinda suck unless ur super lucky,positive

"Great, the combat is pretty fun, it has a good story as well as some pretty amazing art for each of the servants.",positive
Summoning rates are bad and seems to not change. Story is good and is one of the best on mobile. Problem starts with story locked events due to the long story which becomes a chore to do after a while. As much as i like the game forcing a player to rush through story to do events isn't fair. I would like to enjoy doing it in my own pace.,positive
I will fix my review as there is a small note that needs to be added do not run this game with usb debugging on if you transfer devices. Solid game even though gatcha rates are bad some of the lower rarity servants shine when given the love they need. You can beat the game with what they give you. Some of the event 4 stars surpass 5 stars. Just play how you like and enjoy the ride for the story. Don't overlook any servant some can surprise you.,positive

I've been playing this game for a couple of months now and I still haven't gotten a single character above a 3 star character. Unless I actually pay for saint quartz. The character rate for 4/5 star servants is atrocious. on top of that the craft essences are in the same pull as the servants instead of being in a separate pull. I've loved this game up until this point despite what people say about it. But I can't keep trying to farm for saint quartz anymore trying to get servants I wont even get.,positive

Although this games gatcha system is beyond trash (mainly bc 90% of your pulls will be CEs) it has an amazing story and gameplay is easy and fun. The animations arent bad either,positive

"If you are a fan of the series, chances are you want a certain 5 star character. But unless you are willing to drop a couple thousand dollars during a rate-up of said character, you won't. The game is ""generous"" enough to give you quite a bit of quartz for gacha, but the chance of getting a 5 star is pathetic. Out of the countless gacha games I've played, this is arguably the worse one.

I picked it up for the story and ability to collect the cool characters coming from other fate installments I had partook in. The gameplay is moderately enjoyable.

"As a Fate fan, it's really enjoyable and trust me, you can play this game for hours. My only complain is that sometimes the dialogue is messed up and people who complain about gacha rates shouldn't really. One could easily reroll and at the end of the day, we're dealing with percentages‚Äînot certainty.",positive
"First off, let's talk about everybody's pet peeve. Yes, the drop rates are beyond horrible, but it's really not that bad. The combat is pretty much set around a paper/rock/scissor concept, so a 4 star  ""paper"" will do more damage to a ""rock"" than a 5 star ""rock"" and a lot more than a 5 star ""scissor"". So pretty much most of the characters can be used.  Furthermore, I've played many gacha games where you pay through your nose to get a powerful weapon, just to be junk in one month. Not in this game. All the servants are just as useful now as they were a year ago. And last, the welfare servant. Every month of two month they have these specials when you can acquire these 4 star servants that come basically with a maximum Noble Phantasm (their special attacks), and they are all very good servants.  My biggest issue with this game though, and reason I gave it 4 star, is the loading times. They are absolutely ATROCIOUS. Every screen change takes 5-6 seconds. Combat loading can take 30-40 seconds, in the least 20. Farming can get tedious, but other than these I really love this game. There's a lot of thought and work put in the stories and characters.",positive
This game isn't free! The price is your soul as you fall slowly into madness. You will suffocate from all the salt you get from the Gacha. Only those who have fallen into the deepest abyss can warn those oblivious on what's at stake once you hit that download button. You think that you'll be able to finally get Altria Alter with all the SQ you saved up. But no...you'll just get Jing Ke and a bunch of eessence. All in all a great experince 10/10 would sell soul again.,positive

"7/1/2018 This game was great and worked well for me when I first started using  it....a week AFTER it launched in the US since it was almost impossible to  download it when it first came out. However, I started having issues with  the game less than five months after I started playing it. They haven't  been fixed and this current update completely broke the game for me. The  tablet I play it on is fine for specs for playing the game and I was  usually playing it at home on my own Wi-fi. They really need to do  something to fix the issues it seems a lot of people are having. Update 8/12/2019 Well, I finally contacted the developer about the issues I was having with the game on my tablet, and it turned out that my tablet doesn't have the minimum required RAM to play it with all the updates, which is 2GB. They should mention this in the specs somewhere though, as the original specs that are required to download and play it were enough for me to play the game at first, but not over time. Kind of really a downer if you're looking to keep playing it on the same device you started playing it on. I still have to give them the information they require to transfer my account to a new device.",positive
"Game is good though it does have a heavy emphasis on paying to win. Mechanics and animation are also getting updated to the ones in JP which is nice,however,it would be great if devs added a guaranteed SSR roll if you haven't gotten 1 in like a few rolls. At least this way,I don't feel like I actually have to fork out cash to even get a chance to compete in the harder levels.",positive

"Ok game, but the rates for pulling anything halfway decent is so low. After roughly a couple thousand pulls, I have only received 1 5 star servant. Its supposedly a 1% chance, maybe I'm just unlucky, but this seems a bit off to me. The 5 star craft essence rate is 4% and I've pulled a fair amount of those, but more than likely the rate for a servant is a big lie and scam to get people to pay for more currency to keep rolling. Beware.",negative
I have played this game for going on two years now and I think the game is great but would not recommend it to anyone the amount of money you have to pour into the game is ridiculous. even after putting a lot of money into it you are not guaranteed to even get something useful for the game when you do summons you literally eaither get the top servant you were trying to get or you will get trash that helps on no way just might cost you hundreds of dollars to get one servant that is good,positive
Its decent except for the fact that when you go to collect your rewards for completing your daily or extra challenges some are uncollectable which means they just sit their while you click on it and it doesn't give it to you even though it says completed.,positive

The gacha is honestly just luck, I myself have gotten nothing multiple times despite spending money(a frustration that makes me wanna pull my hair out). Though the opposite is also true. If you are a fan of the Fate series, I reccomend this game because it is honestly amazing and no salty review about the gacha should deter you from it.",positive

"Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but the rates and cost of summoning is just absurd. Generously, I'd say it's 25 dollars per 30 saint quartz. You get 1 per first time completion on a quest.

brilliant game but can be repetitive sometimes,neutral
It is a decent game for mobile.... if you ignore the long load times. down right usless CEs researching for team lay outs for f2p plauers and pouring dozen of hours per charachter to make them work. hundreds if you are lucky enough to get 4 or 5 star charchaters story is hard to follow thanks to the textbeing almost all dialogue at times. the gacha is so predatory and bad that playing for 4 years and i only have 7 gold charchater. only one of them are a 5* yes you get hundreads of duplicates.,positive
an absolutely stunning game it isn't dull and boring like the other kind of Gacha games because they keep us entertained with the idea of events and servants that keep pulling us back In and isn't as easy as well so you have to focus more,positive

Gacha rates are awful for characters, to anyone who discovers they have a problem with gambling like I did, don't start! The debt hole is large if you want them all.

"Phenomenal. This is one of the most carefully crafted and lovingly made 'self-aware' F2P games I have ever seen. No, IT IS the best. Hands down. Emotion and patience, care and consideration has been put into this app. It is not predatory in anyway, being the only game I can recall putting a disclaimer in the loading screen about paying being optional. Plus, it respects the break screensaver, which I personally find respectful. Challenging and thoughtful gameplay. Humorous. Try it for a week.",positive

"The gameplay is fun and the story shifts from mediocre to pretty good depending on the chapters available.

"Now, I've never seen the fate series in my life, but I got immersed in this game pretty quickly. The various servant classes, art work, and events are just a few things to look forward to.",positive
so five stars on this game but the only nitpick I have is the story Summons and the fact that 10x summon in any of the Gachas is 30 Crystal it is a bit expensive it would have been nicer if it only cost 10 Crystal this would actually make others feel excited to roll and for those with money to actually spend some money on Crystal's but what would be even better is if in all pulls had a SSR to SR guaranteed drop after say 99 pulls like have a countdown or something. but Good game overall,positive
I like the game and all but the only thing I dislike is the one-time use transfer code. I don't really understand the point of having a password for something you'll only be able to use once. It sucks I can't get my old character back but the game itself is decent.,negative
Two of my friends got me addicted to this... then I got my boyfriend addicted. Worst thing about the game is how addictive it is. It is really fun! A little repetitive with gameplay but it updates things frequently and has great events.,positive

Boring even by gacha standards. The new art in particular is uninspired.,negative
Never mind the negative reviews you are playing a gacha game so stop with the saltiness you should expect to yourself to not get whatever servant you want everytime. as an F2P player with only 3 ssrs I am enjoying the game for its gameplay and storyline. ^^ Keep up the good work Aniplex and DW,positive
Doesn't want to open,negative
liked this game at first but it takes too long in between battles and then i had to keep downloading an update,negative
very overly laggy. do not spend money on quartz to summon new heroes brcause theres a high chance you wont even recieve a hero of any star quality.,positive
"It's fun, a little unfair with the drop rate of most 4 and 5 star servants but still fun nonetheless.",positive
sweet,positive
The game mechanics are fun and I feel like the story belongs in the Type Moon universe which you don't get in alot of spin-off games. The protagonist could have used more personality but they are supposed to be a self insert in the story so it's understandable that the player choices are sometimes bland and don't affect the game in any meaningful way.,positive

Sucks when you need to rely on friends which only gives 25 pts instead of 200 for story support but they're too weak and I can even beat 2nd singularity without. plus you need the friend pts at start of game to summons and upgrade",positive

I have always loved Fate. The only downside is the game is so slow to load and excessive amount of updates. Cool game and storylines though.,positive
"Basically...It's not too bad if it wasn't near impossible to get units. Like this game seriously is looking to grab your money! You're better off playing a slot machine than trying your luck with this game's summon pool. That aside- The game looks nice, and they do allow you to have support units. If im honest though...after Singularity 4 if you haven't gotten at least a SSR and a few SR units then you may as well uninstall because you get locked progress wise. Rather disappointed with this one.",positive
awesome game!,positive
"while this game lacks a good auto mode for farming at higher levels, it combines an interesting story (mostly) with easy to understand mechanics and a diverse cast of characters. the artwork is often disappointing, especially for female characters, but the game is otherwise fun and has good progression for f2p players if you put in a little bit of time. frequent events and drops make it possible to get a good number of summons without paying.",positive

Greatest Game of My Life.,positive
edit: i even spent money on this game and still summoned nothing üò´ Drop rates are terrible and makes it hard to invest even more time into the game especially compared to similar titles.

This game is great and the best freemium game that i ever play. But you need to know anything about fate franchise before play this game.,positive
"Gameplay is simple, with just enough nuance to let you plan out rewarding sets of actions on a turn by turn basis. Power creep exists, but is much slower than most games, with future units doing mostly variations on existing skill combos. I do want to stress that while you can clear all content so far with lower rarity servants, there are clearly stronger servants that exist to bait your wallet. Just know you have a .7% chance of getting your desired 5 star unit.",positive
"Excellent game, famous voice actors and amazing graphics and ost. It doesn't feel like a mobile game with the heavy story and that's what makes it excellent. One thing that is bad is the gacha system, very low drop rate, only 0.7% chance of getting what is currently in rate up banner. Wish it gets higher, and give more saint quartz please. But overall the gacha system requires luck, some only get the 5 star once a year, need to have A+ luck. Can clear with 3 star characters though.",positive

They really put in a lot of work to make each servant into a full blown character, rather than just a collection of stereotypes that only have one facet to their personality. The gameplay is decently fun. Nothing mindblowing but stays fun as things get more challenging. Play for the story, it's also F2P friendly.",positive

Played for 1 year. I LOVE THE characters. Loved the game at first. But it went downhill when you realize that only whales and super lucky players will win in gacha.

good story and gacha is bad civi,negative
"Gameplay is good and does require some strategy in building your team and using their attacks etc. Fans of the Fate series will love this game and the NA translators do a great job in translating and adapting the scripts to a more ""localized"" concept. Even though this is a game with gacha features to get characters, it's possible for f2p players to get good characters by earning the gems through weekly missions, completing maps and participating in events. The game does need some improvements on some basic interface aspects. It needs to allow player to access GAME OPTIONS (e.g. sound settings) at any time instead of forcing the player to advance in the tutorial before anything else can be done. Downloading of game data to speed up load times takes forever to download and if the screen times out during the download, the download apparently pauses, which means your screen must be left on in order to complete the lengthy download, which is dumb.",positive
"Okay, so there is a lot of people talking about this game and a lot of information is either wrong or skewed. 1) The censorship isn't as bad as people are saying it it. All they did was make a character who had hideously charcoal colored skin into tan. 2) The gacha rates are low, but this is compensated by the fact that there are no useless characters. 1-3* characters are usable for the entire game, plus there are no penalties for rerolling your account to get the best 4* from the tutorial.",positive

"abysmal drop rates for any servant. even low tier, save your money and dont spend it on this game. If you want a free play through and a new visit through the fate series its decent and worthwhile, but as you get deeper into the storyline you'll find it difficult to progress due to horrendous drops for any servants worth your time. dont give these people your money until they fix the drop %s and actually provide to their clients.",negative

"Failed Support Team. My account was transferred without me knowing because someone exploited the Account Recovery and now I'm claiming it back,but they failed to verify that I'm the owner. Disappointed. The game is good but the account bind system and the Support team are pathetic.",negative
"This game is amazing. The majority of people that post a 3 star or below are just salty that it isnt like other games they've played. Localization is never an issue in my mind, Japanese game developers usually release their games later in the West, so it makes total sense that we're two years behind them. It's not to say that it's fair, definitely not the case, but it's a game definitely worth your time playing.. This game is an interactive story waiting to be unraveled. Also, waifus.",positive
I hate myself,negative
The gacha is painfully hard to get anything worth pulling and requires serious investment. The plot is good but also drawn out significantly by monotonous battles that should take significantly less time to get through. The only time you're really rewarded with paid currency is if their staff/maintenance team makes errors which they do fairly often. Gameplay - 4/5 Gacha - 1/5 Plot - 3/5 Staff - 1/5 Events - 2/5,negative
"the only thing i have a problem with is the summons,it makes it to where its nearly impossible to get a good character even when theres rate ups,and i know it sounds like im nagging,but not everyone can pay saint qaurtz when they run out of them,so all im saying is that you change the summons to where its more likely to get a good character",positive

Amazing game I love it so much trying to get your own characters and the story is a fun experience though the battles get a little repetitive overall you should get it since you never need to spend a cent unless you need the best of the best though i have 2 and put in 0 dollars so it is not necessary whatsoever. edit: on two hundredth day in January got my last servant was a repeat of maria Antoinette so useless for me and haven't seen one again and i do all events to max rip my luck.,positive

"Great time-sink for those who like Fate's characters. Otherwise, gameplay mechanics are pretty shallow. Progression comes down to luck, grind, and expendable income. For a simple gacha, though, it is undoubtedly polished and always has new content.",positive
this game is really fun but you guys should increase the change of getting a 5 star servant and you should add a online trading system with other masters. thx for your time.,positive
"I'm a fan of the original Fate materials (VN and anime) so naturally this game is a must to play. Adds some dimensions to the Fate universe especially with Servant stories, so I can see any fan of the original Fate series enjoying this. Good story and a diverse roster of servants. One can progress thru the story even without any SR servants so it's not really pay-to-win. My only problem though are the slow loading times. But other than that, I'm enjoying it a lot.",positive
"A colossal waste of money. After spending hundreds, playing FGO for a good year now, I've gotten almost nothing to show for it, to the point where I feel stupid going for 5 stars campaign after campaign.

To sum it up, not only does it have horrendous pull rates, but you also have hours and hours of grinding and the 10 summoning gacha only guarantees a 4 star card that can be craft essence too.

But the characters are iconic, lovable, and have both a personality and a backstory to love. If that's your cup of tea, play FGO.",positive

"Loved Fate and its storytelling for a long time now, and this game is a welcome addition to the Fate multiverse! Great servant collection and dynamic music to go with the stories and events, as well as comic relief and decent battle system. The gacha rate is pretty low on average if you want a 5 star servant, but events offer free 4 stars that can make up for that, barely. :p",positive

Best. Gacha. Game. Ever.,positive
"10/10 would roll again but in all seriousness, this game is great. While it slowly catches up to the jp server, NA does a fine job progressing. While some things may be censored and rewards that are not as good as jp, NA deserves no hate and should be supported by the people who translated all of the scenes even if the translation is not perfect. And yes we all know FGO is notourious for the low rates, but it still encourages F2P with the free summon tickets and fragments.",positive
"- Unfair summoning rates: always got 1*-3* Servants, and essence cards. 4* Servant or higher are impossible. This is my #1 complaint. - Spending real life currency to buy Saint Quartzs to get more chances to obtain 4* Servants and 5* Servant is considered gambling. It's absolutely not worthy to spend. - Story progression and challenges are beyond reasonable. Massive Health/Hit Points (HP) of all Servant bosses and high rank monsters is not considered challenge but discourage to the new players.",negative
"Type-Moon did a great job with this game. They improved the concept of a typical gacha game, by not creating a pay wall, and allowing everyone to get access to all content. This game is story rich (the quality of a great visual novel inside a cellphone), character rich(100+ unique heroes with amazing art and original japanese voice acting) and very well maintained. The only warning that i leave is that, some people can't stand the random results of the gacha. Do your research and roll wisely. :)",positive

One of the best turn based comprehensive RPG I've played. I've been following the JP version since it's launch and I've played the english version too since it's launch and it had not disappointed me.

"Good game, good gameplay but abysmal worth. the draw rates for this game are the absolute worst of all gacha games. I'm sure this makes the dev's tons of money with whales but it actively drove me away from it",positive
"A lot of negative reviews seem to be because of pure salt. The gacha rates are supposed to be low so you truly feel rewarded rolling a 5 star servant, rather than being handed everything to you. The story itself is somewhat interesting but I have more fun leveling the servants I really love and bonding with them. At the end of the day it's gameplay is fun and rewarding when you play with your favorite husbando or waifu. If you're reading this may good luck come to your rolls :).",positive

"The characters are amazing, the story is refreshing and the gameplay is okay. The game uses the background of the Fate franchise to establish its setting and it does it quite well! The usage of Singularities and servants prove very entertaining, especially considering that servants are inspired from historical figures from our reality. I do believe the detriment in gameplay stems from the inability to quickly do battles via skipping the NP. Overall, the game is quite satsifying to play.",positive
I love this game so much ! the only thing I don't like it that the update isn't downloading ? i'm trying but it won't work :( my daily login won't count in 9 minutes and im anxious about it,positive

"I personally love this game. the art is beautiful, the story has some silly glitches sometimes but it kind of adds to the uniqueness, and the play style is simple yet classic. it's kind of like an old turn style based rpg. not to mention, I dig that all of the characters are either referenced from historical people or added in as a fantasy character associated with said history. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of turn based rpgs.",positive

"The gacha rates for FGO are so bad, you can save or purchase as many Saint Quartz as you eant, youll always get the same 3 star servants and craft essences. Even if you do happened to get 4 or 5 star pulls, its rarely ever any Servants. Storyline can be a bit boring at times and some character designs and personalities really could use some improvement. Just overall disappointed with the rewards and gacha rates compared to other games I play.",positive
"A game were almost every player will be able to find characters they absolutely adore, the problem is that most of the time, the chances of getting those characters is only 4% (5 star and 4 star servants.) I love the gameplay and the amount of freedom in it, you can play in almost any style you want if you can make a good team, be it stalling, taking your time criting or going with buster damage. The story is INSANELY good and easily worth downloading the game just for it. Easy 5 stars for me.",positive

Fun and adfictive.game Above all where my MHXA TT,positive
I love this game but please add an pvp or an arena,positive

"great game with good story, the power creep can be handled with good support from friends and the command spell is like a cheat to win the round easily without needing to have a good servant. in regards to the ppl who say its p2w they're wrong, just look at me. spend no money on this game still complete its current chapter and finish its event. welfare servant are good enough to complete the game so are the lower tier servant with right support and strategy.",positive

Addicting. The rate is not a problem.,positive
doesn't link to any other accounts so if you forget to write down your code your account is just gone,negative
The only issue I have with this game truly is that you need to initiate a data transfer to continue where you left off if you uninstalled the game even if you're trying to continue on the same device. That's a pretty hard blunder to overlook and needs to be addressed sooner than later.,positive
Great game no need to send money unless you want to support the Dev team. If you've followed the visual novel or the anime you see many of your favorites in the game.,positive
Absolutely love the game. not truly a pay no win since you can do 95% of the content with worked on 3 stars but it feels nice to pull 5 stars. Type moon also gives very few gems for beginners but the game is fun and a decent rpg.,positive
ok great game,positive

"Great game, very addicting. However, the gacha seems very unbalanced so far. I have been playing for a while and eventually saved up around 200 saint quartz, I didn't use any quartz after tutorial summon. I was expecting some 4 stars and at least one 5 star. I was hopelessly wrong i got nothing but 3 stars, this really ruins the gameplay experience. I wish that the rates are higher or just to lower the price to purchase quartz. Otherwise, I love the storyline and gameplay.",positive

"At this point this gacha game is pretty archaic, slow loading times, no auto targeting often resulting in attacks being wasted on enemies that are already dead. Story Is pretty damn boring. It's pretty nice that there are 4 star and 5 star servants being released monthly, the downside to this of course is that the summon rate is so horrendous you'll probably never own any of them without paying.

Not for those with gambling issues however.",positive

"The game by itself has good and bad characteristics - It is a gacha game and not a mother to give anything you want.  Personally, I play since January 2018 and I like the main story - mainly after ""E Pluribus Unum"" (USA singularity). Almost all characters are at least good enough and I cannot complain about the events.  But the most important thing in this game is the support. I can tell about it, because I got a great help from them after making a mistake about my account - I simply had forgotten to take note about my ID number before unistalling the game to fix a connection issue.  The support just asked for some confirmation about the servants and other stuff to check. I didn't even lose a login streak.  Trust me, man... This support is great and, lately, services with a good support to customers are difficult to find out.",positive
"Gacha is not really good. Everything else (gameplay, graphics, freebies, etc.) are satisfactory.",positive

"Been a Fate fan since 2006 but this game is just how low they can go, dont waste your money, there putting the cash into there own pockets (lawsuit recently), with the money they have, they can do better than this trash money milking gacha gambling game, with terrible lazy gameplay, and art. There is an arcade version, but even thats just terrible cookie cutter gameplay with 3D modules.",negative

"Fate/Grand Order is yet another waifu-collecting gacha game (the male to female ratio in this game is like 1 to 3). It also is one of the most unforgiving with an incredibly low 1% 5-star (SSR) rate. Of course, lower rarity servants (characters) are still decent to use but are generally outclassed by 5-stars.New players, f2p, and just generally unlucky people will probably have the hardest time getting through the game. Still, the gameplay is quite engaging and fun compared to other gachas.",positive

I can appreciate and understand when a company ask for micro transactions on a free game but when the basic functions are broken and the game waste a great deal of the users time with no reward ultimately destroys any reason to play this game.

"In general it's a turn based JRPG with a really famous anime ip in Japan. The main stories are the very soul of this game. Make sure you judge after finishing Ch 7. The gacha rate is pure gambling with almost no ganrantee for F2P players, however the game is still beatable without any 5 stars. Unlike other games, it really takes time to journey yourself through, including raising servants. Make peace with your greeds, If you are anxious about getting everything it will cost a great deal.",positive

Can you please update so it doesn't crash on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and I'll give it a different rating.,positive
"Seems like a pretty cool game. Animation is great, music is great, gameplay is fun. But the beginning is absolutely infuriating. It's really irritating when you're trying to find a stopping point and the game is shoehorning you into doing mission after mission without access to the menu or party customization or anything at all until a decent amount of progress into the game is made. There's nothing worse than being in between missions and having only one icon you can select with the rest of the screen grayed out over and over again.",positive

"This game was doing very well in not censoring itself for a western audience like so many other mobile games from Japan do.

Everything about the game has been fun so far I just wish the in game currency was a bit cheaper. math works out to average about $300 per 5* character pull. But if you play long enough they give you enough rolls for free that you can at least get a couple of them even with mediocre luck.,positive

Fate fanboy so I'm definitely biased but hey! Fate for the phone what's not to love. Fun characters. Occasionally pretty goofy story that like any good fate franchise can pull off the switch to serious if it wants and very generous events makes this a fun game.

"Time for a 2019 update. I finally bumped the rating up to 4 stars, because they began implementing some of the really important QoL updates (back button, auto burn, etc etc). STORY 2019- gets better in Camelot to Shinjuku arcs; first five singularities just seem like garbage in comparison. GRAPHICS 2019- no improvement. GACHA 2019- still one of the worst systems on any platform; NA is stingier with free currency than JP. OVERALL 2019- fun enough for what it is: a waifu/husbando game with plot",positive

A fun game for everyone to play based on the anime. Fate GO is a much different story than the ones I've seen before. Masters get more than one servant for one thing in this game and if your characters lose unlike the anime they come back. You should definitely download this game for fans and even people who never heard of it may still like it so try it out it's free lol.,positive
this is good game,positive
"Battle Mechanics, Story, and Music are great, but drop rates, both for certain materials as well as Gacha Rates, are horrible. Events can fix the issue with Materials, but Gacha Rates make it nigh impossible to get Gold Servants, which sucks since aside from missable Welfares, the only other methods of getting Gold Servants is through the nearly unusable Unregistered Spirit Origin system due to the insane conditions required to get one let alone 10 for a single 5-Star. If that feature specifically was less tedious, I'd gladly give this game 5 Stars, as everything else in it is deserving of a perfect rating.",negative
Ready your wallets every event.,positive
Fun game based on the anime all of my favorite characters as well as new ones makes up a great story. As a fan or not I would definitely download this game You may like it.,positive

"Great story, and many, many loveable characters make up for the gross SSR gacha rates. I've been playing this for a little over a year now and still love it. vowed not to spend originaly, but did so anyway lol you also do not need ssr to clear content. it's a lot more fun that way for many players. however ssr units make it much easier. you especially want the support casters (Waver, Merlin, Tamamo, Hans, and skadi when shes put in) only warning- be ready for the grind and bad ssr drop rates",positive

well i got alturia with my bad luck so dis game 10/10,positive
"Game is meh at best. Hard to believe it's popular with how many problems there are. Firstly the game doesn't give you near enough energy to get anything done. Secondly early game stages cost too much energy, seriously needs to be halved. No reliable way to level up servants, need cards to do that but late teens levels require more and the cards don't give nearly enough. The gacha components need tuned, need to separate banners for servants and the other components.",positive

Only that one would load and run, yet the other, after some prodding nigh 30 minutes, returned an unfailing error code 43.

This exclusivist protoco is undeniably discriminatory and unfair towards certain roles and confuses security with connectivity.",negative
Couldn't even play. App doesn't start correctly.,negative
"Terrible gacha rates for 5*Servants, ungenerous game compared to other gacha games. Stagnant gameplay, roundabout level-up system and unvoiced story/events. Soundtrack is decent, art is inconsistent (some are very beautiful, others not so much). Considering how long the game has been out in JP and how much money they are making, you'd expect these things to improve, but they're not. It's still good fanservice for Fate fans as it's always nice to see new Servants.",positive

Failed to open and caused Game Launcher to crash.,negative
Actually an amazing game everyone here is saying that it's hard to get the gacha currencies but if you save for awhile you can get 120 in a month if you haven't completed the story and the censoring was good if you saw the background,positive
Finally got a phone that can run it. Great game.,positive
"Censorsing a servant because someone has a problem with him doesn't give them a right to outright change him. I won't be staying here anymore longer if there is more censorship or they don't fix him, I'll take my money and go to JP. To the people who actually cares about emiya alter please contact JP team and tell them what is happening on NA server since NA team doesn't want to listen to us and ignore their fans, maybe then they'll start to listen once JP gets invovled.",positive

lost my account,negative
I'll be frank the gacha in the game is a headache because the most you can expect is a 3-star servant. And what I think sucks is that when there is a increased drop-off rate other servants drop-off rate decreases. It really can anger people who work their butts of getting saint quartz. not to mention you need 5 of the same 5-star character to get the materials to be able to summon a 5-star in the shop. Other than that I think the game is great I love its gameplay and their story's and events.,positive

didnt launch. almost broke my phone. I wish I didnt sound like a bot.,positive
"This game is great, characters story and the BGM is awesome, you need to deepen the bond of a characters to unlock the dialogue, each characters has connections on one another you will unlock the dialogue if you have the corresponding character. Many people don't like this game because of the gacha, at least here you can use the lower tier hero in the endgame not like other gacha game, you just need to be patient and have a little bit of luck to get the character that you want.",positive
"didn't have enough beginners boost (i.e saint quartz, tickets etc.) drop rates for servants ""up"" never had any 4 star servant while spending 90 saint quartz which is hard to get because mission rewards only give you 1 saint quartz for the whole mission which requires a whole lot of ap, for beginners like myself I didn't find this entertaining at all spending time to work for just 1 saint quartz spending all of those resources just to get the thing I wanted.",positive

Its a good game with a great story and interesting characters. This would be a great gatcha if it weren't for the unfair and scummy summoning system which barely gives you anything. Improve the summoning and it gets 5 stars.,positive

"Gameplay and story are fine, and the characters are well designed. However the gacha system is so unforgiving, as it is almost impossible to get any gold servants even in 30 quartz roll, requiring you to spend more money in the game. Overall I like the game.",positive

"Terrible drop rates, I know i spent alot in a short period trying to get a certain card. Lost my game after backup and trying to move account. Wasnt pleased by the hassle and moved on. Eventually found my gacha home in granblue fantasy which I like better. To each his own",negative
the game is amazing great story great chatacter development but the only two problems that stop this game from being a 5 star is the gacha system and the saint quartz drops When being on the gacha system the chances of getting the character you want or need is extremely slim Saint quartz drops make me want to stop playing anyone can spend from 15 mins to an 1 hour and get very few drops just getting 1 saint quartz for spending 15 minutes on one level if anything these two things need improvement,positive

"I love the over all story of the game an the drop system is really good. But it not worth putting money into. The summon is just not worth it. 10x summon fills like it was just thrown to get in a rush without proper planning, and you have a better chance at getting new craft essances and servents on one pull.",positive

Stale and unbalanced meta, with only buster being good, quick being mediocre and arts being downright bad. Abysmal gacha rates. Great dialouges, story and characters. Conclusion: Great story and characters being let down by shoddy gameplay and lazy development. 3/5 at best. Wouldn't recommend to non-whales.",positive
"It is fun for a bit but this is without a doubt one of, if not THE, biggest cash grab mobile games. The drop rates, even with the special events are actually TERRIBLE, and it takes at LEAST 2 weeks to get enough gems (or whatever they are called) to get a free 10 pull even if you are playing every day as often as the game lets you. Honestly, I recommend Fire Emblem Heroes over this game. the drop rates are better, the game is more fun, and its easier to get free pulls than this game.",positive
"Been a NA player since day 1, just want to share some opinions/advices for this game: Do not play this game if you have enough gambling addiction and not enough income. Do not love this game if the authentic JP experience is more important to you than minor censorships. Do not lose your daily login streak and miss your weekly quests if you want more free rolls for gacha. Do not forget putting your Servants and Craft Essence in your support list or I'll kick your ass with my Cu Chulainn.",positive

Its a good complicated game but once you understand how everything works. Its a fun non-repetitive game. (You will be salty though.),positive
"This is a fun game with a major drawback. The gacha system is the worst and most unbalanced system I've ever experienced. Servents and crafts are summoned from the same thing. So if you plan on summoning servents, be prepared to not even get them. The only way to guarantee that you summon a servents is to do the 10 pull for 30 saint quartz which if free to play is not easy or quick to aquire. Not only that, but the rates are terrible. In over a month of play I've aquired 1 4* servent and no 5* I've even paid money and got nothing to show for. I know I can't blame anybody but myself for that but it's extremely demoralizing. I'm a big fate fan and alot of the cooler more known and captivating characters are 5* cards that you're chances of pulling are near impossible. Because of this I'm left extremely disappointed in this game and can not recommend it to anyone. Sadly the game is good, but the gacha system is horrible.",negative

I missed the entire darn Valentine event because that update did nothing but forced my phone to restart every time I tried to update.

After becoming a success by taking our money for over a year, and they refuse to acknowledge this issue puboicly. The slippery slope has been engaged. Do NOT trust this team. They don't intend to deliver you the genuine experience. They're going to swindle you to please the PC zealots.",negative

"The English server has long struggled with delays and missing quartz rewards, but now they've moved to actively censoring character art. There's been no communication or transparency or talk of compensation; they're just hoping outrage will die down. But I can't recommend a duplicitous product with a poor translation.",negative
"It's a good game and a good time sink if you want to do nothing but grind. On the other hand, the gacha rates suck. You'll be swimming in garbage craft essences before you get anything decent.

"Game is very fun if you understand that this is a wiafu/husbando battle story sim gacha game. With emphasis on the gacha part. You can play this game 100% free to play but, it does it's best to convince you to pay for quartz as often as it can. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy the game.",positive

"The story of an unqualified narcoleptic sent back in time by a dark-ops team of wizards to set history right with the aid of anime-ized historical figures sounds fascinating.

It is excruciatingly dull and repetitive farming for resources that do not give themselves up easily combined with a punishingly stingy gacha system. Stay far away.",negative
love it and everything fate,positive
this is amazing,positive
"Personally I think the game is amazing and if you play your SQ right getting what you want without paying also works out, though this game has a strong pay drive the farther you get rng farming will catch you regardless if you want to acend your servants, my favorite part of the game is that it doesn't require that you use just gold tier characters because you can use low tier bronze characters too since the characters are all useful in their own way...except anja or whoever from friend summon",positive

"The game runs very smoothly and is overall quite entertaining, some matches can prove to be very difficult while some are a breeze especially later game but I find myself always enjoying enhancing my favorite servants and building better teams. My only flaw with the game would be how expensive it is for Crystal's, but it does make attaining 30 by grinding for a new summons more special",positive
"For my first mobile.gacha game, it has suprisingly good story. while it may not have live3d animations, the extensive amoun of characters prove satisying by themselves.",positive
Years and years I've waited and now it's here! I love Fate series and I love how there are extra class servants. üíï Thank you for making my fantasy into reality.

I absolutely love this game. Decent gameplay with an amazing story.,positive
I love the Fate series as a whole and this game is a great RPG style strategy game. I wish the rate of the gacha was better though. This game is pretty overpriced to play compared to other similar type of gacha out there. It is free to play but to get the better servants and make them stronger they demand and ask too much in costs to their player base I feel. On average it can take like $400 to pull x1 5* servant. That's just ludicrous and unfair cost.,positive

"Awesome story and beautiful aesthetics. The gameplay is also good and fun to strategize around but grinding can get pretty frustrating at times and you are at the mercy of random chance when trying to get a specific character(even if you whale, you might still fail). The whole game is fully playable, enjoyable and beatable even without the strongest servants but dedicating a lot trying to get your hands on your favourite only to get super unlucky is soul crushing.",positive

"Well the drop rates for servants in this game are just down-right terrible. I spent 500 quartz and didn't get a single 5 star servant. I'm just tired and done with this game. I'll take my money to a game that actually appreciates it. The funny thing is, if the drop rates weren't so bad, and I actually got even a single 5 star servant, I wouldn't be leaving, and I would have actually spent money to get future servants that I want. But now, unfortunately, they won't be getting anything from me. I guess people without gambling problems aren't this game's target audience.",positive

could be better dokkan battle still stands on top cause the summons actually give u a chance and can get more summoning crystals with one mission instead of doing the same mission 3 times in a row to get a single summoning crystal,positive

this game is so frustrating to play due to bs such as farming for materials being unplayably bad I've gotten near 10 ssr's and around 30 or so sr's so it's not my characters that are the issue but I can't upgrade them due to materials having such terrible drop rates such as octoplet crystals nearly 70% of the characters I have require 10 or 20 of them but there are no good ways to get them so I can't do anything it's extremely unfair something needs to change nodes need to be less stingy fix now,negative

Amazing game as well the customer care is top tier. I lost my account and within a day I got it back. Thanks a bunch Fate/Go Biggest issue with the game is how stingy they are with quartz. Not to mentioned with the terrible rates it's ridiculous how much time you need to save in order to summon any unit. Not to mention celebrations are terrible compared to other gacha games. As if they have so much pride and refuse to give more than 20 quartz at a time,positive

"gacha ruined my life 10/10 Seriously now, if you know what Fate is, there's no reason you shouldn't pick this up. It's more a viaual novel than a game anyway, as the ""gameplay"" is fairly simplistic. If you don't know what Fate is, go watch Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Ufotable, 2014, the series, not the movie), then Fate/Zero. The order of those is arguable, since Zero is the prequel and technically was made first, but that's my personal recomendation.",negative
"literally loose 2 stars 1st for drop chance bs...2nd because rate up is a lie. literally the games only 2 issues and it sucks I have to spend an unholy amount of time to farm it when I have school, work, and a family to deal with.

"Game could be fun,but ruined by HORRIBLE rates,and i dont mean bad...HORRIBLE! What is the point of playing a game if you can't get any of the rare characters even after throwing your wallet at it? Games that bleed people dry like this game trys to do should be banned.",negative
A fun light rpg game for fans of the Fate/Type Moon universe or for history buffs that don't mind the lines being blurred once in a while. The simple rockpaperscissors scheme gives way to more complex gameplay that is enjoyable. The downsides are the recharge time needed to complete quests that limit progress with some fairly low drop rates of mats which can make it take a long time to upgrade your favorite servants while you wait. This along with the very low ssr drop rate may turn away some,positive
"An excellent gacha game with a story that is will make you not put your phone down for hours. Gameplay is great and has you thinking up strats on what servants to bring in certain situations and what cards (Buster, Arts, Quick) to choose to make the best combo. Overall the game is amazing and i am a huge fan of the fate series and support the developers 100%.",positive

"Been playing since late 2017. It's quite a massive experience to be contained in a mobile game. While one may feel compelled to roll on shiny gold servants, it's far from necessary as this is one of the most F2P friendly games I've played. Often the game gives out powerful 4 star servants for event participation. My sole complaint is that it's unfriendly to non-launch players. Given how hard grinding outside of events is, new players will almost never catch up to their launch friends.",positive
Best game I've ever seen in english from Japan yet. Would definitively recommend to my friends.,positive
it's a fun game. Always new things coming. fun characters and events. original combat system. lots of lore. I absolutely love it. but as this is a review I will say this. you have to be ok with not always getting who or what you want. especially if your going FTP. you can earn alot if your willing to grind. but you have to be ok with not getting what you want sometimes.,positive

"This is a game not for everyone. If you have any objections to microtransactions and no self control, this isn't your game. If you have a passing interest in the Fate series but no self control, this isn't for you. Dispite how much I want you to play. If you have just an ounce of self control and a passing interest in Fate, it's all you chief. The story for NA (part 1) is pretty good. The gameplay system is simple to pick up and guides you into thinking how to complex wave and boss clearing.",positive

This game has great graphics, animations, great plotline with dialogue options, the voice acting is spectacular and the combat system is extremely intiuitive! The gacha system was new to me, but once you get addicted, you start spending more on summons, which is where the addicting part comes in.. if you want the good 5‚òÖ and 4‚òÖ servants, you better be prepared to pay a little bit.",positive

The characters make you want to spend on the gatcha for them, but unless you have insane luck dont expect to get a high rarity servant unless you are willing to spend an average of 100-300 dollars. I love this game and will keep playing it but fix the gatcha such low odds for even a chance at a servant is ridiculous. This is coming from a player with multiple 5 star / 4 star servants.",positive

"If you would have said EA developed this game I would believe you with the amount of times I've been screwed, the game is great, but with the amount of money they require you to spend for Saints Quartz along with how overcrowded the summonings are with useless Craft Essences I already have tons of or don't need paired with how many servants are in this game, you might as well call this Fate: Battlefront because of how low the SSR5 and servant drop rates are compared to the useless amounts of CE's",negative
I LOVED it! it was such a good experience!,positive
"I've been playing this game since launch, and have been picking it up and putting it down frequently. Despite that, I have to say that I really do love this game. While it does have microtransactions, they are entirely ""optional"".

Overall, I love Fate GO and would recommend it to anyone who is a Fate fan.",positive
great game I love the combat using cards for can be hard for some to get into the gacha is hate full at times but when I do pull a five star I feel exhilarating the story is great to me pS I did get Jalter as my first 5star so I was never salty about it too much use her on every team,positive
"This game won an award of excellencey at the 2018 Japanese Games Awards. Also an anime is in the works based on FGO's Camelot, Babylon and Solomon chapters.

Since the game developers are still producing monthly content in Japan till this day, I see myself playing FGO for a couple of more years. I highly recommend Fate Grand Order to anyone who wants to play a mobile game with in depth storyline and amazing characters.",positive
Gacha ruined my life :^),neutral
The game is good but can you please add a quest to earn more saint quartz because its hard to get it. I suggest that when summoning 10 pulls 5 star servant will be guaranteed because the saint quartz is hard to get. Its annoying sometimes when we summon 10 pulls yougive us a lot of useless craft essence. We poor people is only free to play we dont have enough money to buy those saint quartz.,negative

"Surprisingly good for a mobile game. gameplay is a turn based rpg with rock paper scissors combat between classes composed of the classic 7 and some special classes like ruler or the new shielder class. Some servants are unfortunately not very good but with the right team you can make any of them work. Gacha lottery rates are frustrating, if you want a favorite character you have to get lucky during a rare rateup. story gets really good once you get to the Camelot story arc. Very grindy though.",positive

"So far I am enjoying this game solely for the story, and while I don't care about things like servant rarity there is one major thing that I am dissatisfied about, the leveling system. It does not make sense to me that servants do not gain experience through battle, instead we are required to chance upon leveling cards and other servants to sacrifice to the ones we want to level. Experience is the best teacher but this system feels sorta pay to win for me due to low drop rates for level cards.",positive

The Gacha summons are horrific in your chances of actually getting something good.

spent 90 dollars on summons for only all my data to get lost along with said 90 dollars that was used in summons.... real great game.,positive
super mega awesome fun time!!!!!,positive
"Good solid parallel universe story for fans of the Fate series, battle graphics are unfortunately 3D based (so very battery consuming), and the 5* summon rate is so pathetically low that players almost pretty much have to pay to be able to proceed with the story. Not as F2P friendly as games like FFBE or FEH.",negative
Phone games shouldnt have stories this good,positive
"love the story, love the character and the bgm, the gameplay is easy to learn and if you joined the community it becomes complete, so many lore and character to discuss, this is a good game, the problem is the rate summon, but it is not a big deal, because you can clear story with just 1 to 3 star servant, but if you want that spesific rate up servant, than you better save those quartz",positive

"Want to play this game so bad, but it keeps crashing",negative
the gacha makes me wanna die but its part of the fun,positive
"Initially the game is quite enjoyable. It's battle system is easy to understand. The game boasts a large array of mythical, historical, and fantastical heroes and while it's story can be rather lackluster it is still something to make note of. However, the main issue lies in the gatcha system. It's rates are, quite frankly, abyssal. In the early stages of the game you'll hardly notice this, but long-term it becomes quite clear that if you want to progress smoothly your money is needed.",positive
Rate up is only sometimes a lie. Most of my waifus come home so can't complain as far as gacha games go. The combat and story depth keep me coming back daily.,neutral
"Great game. graphic, story wise is amazing. There is a lot of details in the side missions for every servant and many events. I love that with good strategy you can beat any enemy. the only downsides are the rate ups. It takes too much to get the servant you want. You can literally waste hundreds of dollars and not get what you want since bonuses mix with the rolls. if any dev, read this, at least for the first summons make bundles or fixed prices for servants and keep gacha for Np5 or CEs",positive
"Been having fun with the game. Grind is boring at times but story, gameplay, and event challenges are top-notch.",positive
"It is a fun game, but I should be able to use my free EARNED saint quartz on the summons rather then buy my way into anyone with money can do that but to sit and actually finish the missions and earn the quartz which was a waste because now I can't use them.",positive
"best game, most expensive game",positive
This game is absolutely gorgeous...,positive

"poorly optimized (running a Samsung Galaxy Tab A) im playing at like 10 fps, i feel like im playing in decelerated time at all times. Ui is an absolute eyesore at best (everything except the dialogue screens in story) and tear enducing at best (summon screen banners?). i dont like how they force you to burn your ""free summon gift"" on their scripted banner. Art is nice of course and using your favorite servants is great. Your free servant is the cutest anime girl. Story has merit.",positive

I'm in debt,negative
"An interesting story concept and beautiful graphics are crippled by a card-based combat system, which is immediately broken by the game FORCING you to take other people's characters on EVERY SINGLE mission!

"it says you wont lose your save data by uninstalling, but it forgets to mention that you need to make a restore code beforehand. otherwise very fun!",positive
"Finished the Grand Order, made some friends, lost some as well... it's a hell of game and a perfect way to end the year. Happy New Year everyone.",positive
"Doesn't use Google Play to back up your data. Paid money to build up a collection, and something happens to your phone? Thanks for your the money, you lose everything. Every minute of progress, every penny you spent building your collection. All of it's gone.",positive
"The Fate universe has quite a lot going for it, but this might be one of my favorite entries in the series. A gigantic cast of Servants, a story that starts with a slow burn and quickly picks up the pace, and a combat system with just enough complication to not bog down the play.",positive
Great experience would recommend Wish there was a safety net for summons though,positive
"So much more than I ever expected of a phone game. It's the top grossing phone game for good reason. The outstanding storytelling is really what makes you question, ""this is a free phone game?!"" On that note, it is possible to play the entire game for free. There aren't even any ads. The gacha can be frustrating as any, but there are a lot of excellent lower ranking pulls that many still rely on in spite of having top ranked servants. Overall not without its flaws, but I'd recommend it any day.",positive
My favourite gatcha game,neutral
Very well made the best app game I've played so far but would like to have the drop rate change and made a little more easier to grind it takes up too much time and resources and it makes the player rather wait for the next event rather than play the game.,positive
It's a great game!,positive
"The storyline starts off a bit weak but then blows you completely away. The writing is truly incredible. For those who think you need 4* & 5* servants are wrong. One of my most frequently used servants is a grailed one star. His NP is stronger than some of the 5*s. I used him throughout the entire Babylonia and Solomon singularities. He delivered every time. Don't fall for the ""gold"" trap. Besides, there are PLENTY of whales that'll support you. One of the best turn based battle games to date.",positive
"I don't usually play mobile game with micro-transactions, but this game is well worth the exception.",positive
i can't load the game. it shows me a black screen everytime i load it either using Wifi or mobile data.,neutral
"I take back all complaints, play this game if you're a Fate fan or just want a good story.",positive
give me a 5 star and ill give you a 5 star,negative
"Now that the ending to the first part of the game is up, I thought it appropriate to finally review the game. Fate/Grand Order is an epic title. boasting one of if not the strongest narrative in mobile gaming. You wouldn't know that starting out though. as it takes a while to actually really going. However, it does have its stellar game play to carry it through first. It's strategic, flexible and most importantly fun. its only downside are the drop rates for 4 and 5* servants.",positive
"Its a good game but the only problem is that its not Released in UK I have to use a USA VPN so i can instal the game , can they make the release for UK",negative
"Well it took sometime but it's done from when I first started my account on my old phone with only 2 singularity playable i couldn't wait to see what this game had, but alas my phone broke and i never got to continue so i gave up thinking to return in the future and was i surprise of how much i missed i wish i could have been there for the events and other moments of joy but enough of me. This game has such an unique story and really pulls you in once you start playing you'll get the hang of it",positive

"Eats my money. You'll want characters from summons but never get them. Instead you'll probably just get the same 5 star ""CE"" 5 times in a row. The Grind in this game is a pain. Monsters only drop things 10% of the time and in most cases you dont get the materials you need. I can only recomend this game to people that like hitting their heads against walls or like waifus and husbandos.",negative
Good game plagued with the inability to save your game other than that set back it's a decent game that I feel fans of the /Extra series would appreciate,positive

Fate Grand Order is amazing in my opinion and has loads of servants/characters that keep me playing it,positive
"The gameplay, story, and graphics are great but the fact that this is a gatcha game really lowers my appraisal. It is totally possible to beat the game as a f2p player but the developers really want your money because it's difficult to get the free servants because they lock them behind exclusive event items you have to roll. Even in terms of gatcha games their are better alternatives. the percentage of getting a rate up 5* servant is at best 1%. That's ridiculous. Go play another gatcha game.",positive
"A very entertaining game I gotta say, rage quitted and deleted my acc 9 months ago and came back to start a new acc 2 months ago and gotta say I'm happy as I rolled raikou and merlin. Summons can sometimes be very irritating and frustrating but ya'll people who complain about the drop rates just be very PATIENT and use Sq WISELY for your favorite characters. I'm f2p player as well",positive

"1 The Gachta rates are insaine and feel way to Pay to participate for a 3 star or higher. 2 The combat get repetitive and the quest are like, why am i doing this? 3 The game has been very niche and not very open to different types of players, its very punishing. 4 rewards suck making it an insaine grind. 5 the grind to get a character leveled up and limit broken and basically useable is insaine. 6 events are rediculus and over the top and feel liek they are designed for day 1 players. 7 $$$$$$$",negative

"Pretty good game. Story has an original style of it and on a different universe with the other fate series but still has the same master-servant concept. Gacha was the same as other gacha games out there but with really low chances of getting it. My only problem with this game is how unsecure the binding codes is, I mean why not make it like other games (Azur Lane) in where we can bind it using our twitter or facebook and use it over and over without the need of getting a new code everytime.",negative

As a long time fate fan I will say that I love this game. Do your research before playing and you will have an even better experience especially if new to this game.

"Surprisingly fun and has kept my attention for half a year now. They put out new, well done events often enough to not get bored, but not enough to burn you out. Story is pretty good. Maintenance is short and rewards are generous afterwards. The premium currency is too expensive, but there are plenty of ways to get it in game. Plus they aren't constantly ramming ""buy our currency"" down your throat. It always feels like the developers care a lot about their players. Highly recommend.",positive
one of the best anime games that's out there.,positive
"While not the smoothest graphically, and the battle system could use a tiny adjustment in enemy targeting the overall gameplay and balancing to make every servant worthwhile I very fun. At first I thought 1 and 2 stars were useless, but many tend to have devastating NPs and abilities to buff and disable, and while the grand summons can get VERY grating with the random chance, it's overall most of the time worth the grind to see that one or two servants u love reach their final Ascensions.",positive

"Honestly, out of a majority of games that I have played, this has to be one of the most boring. The only things I liked about the game, is the fact that it is a Fate game, the beautiful art and the combat system. Otherwise, it is truly a bore.",positive
this is a fun strategy game and I really storyline and the characters but there is one issue that I have and probably everybody can agree on is how the summoning is pretty bad because they have the servant and the equipment put together rather than apart I can understand if they put them together so players can get a chance to get a Five Star Equipment or five star servant and you only need 30 Quartz but why not have them separate but they have different value like the equipment needs 20 or 25 Quartz while the servants need 40 or 45 Quartz beyond that it's still a good game Edit: also the weekly quests are pretty bad because they give you 14 Quartz pieces total each Quest gives you 2 pieces and they are very easy to do but you have to Exchange 7 Quartz pieces to get 1 Quartz seemed like a good deal but you need 3 Quartz to use the single summoning and that you have to wait for a week to get more kind of strange that they're not daily Quest,positive
"5 stars easy. I dont spend a single cent on this game, but still having fun. Funny though, a lot of players have hatred for this game simply because they cant get what they want and blames the devs for it. lmao. Anyway, I love this game.

It does not make sense how this kind of game that looks like a web browser game can take so much space and takes forever to load. I've played other games that has way better graphics and plays way faster than this. #wasteoftime,positive
"I loved this game until my phone broke suddenly and I had to wait for a year for an upgrade for a new phone. Since the game only allows one game transfer (new users beware) I could not use my loaner phone to play in the time while I waited. When I got my new phone, Fate GO was the first game I downloaded, but since my old phone had broke suddenly, I had not prepared for the data transfer and didn't have an ID or password. I contacted support with every known information I could give them. I spent hours on wiki to find every single servant, ascension level, craft and essence card. I knew almost every servant of my party and who was my flavored servant. I did not however know my user name, as it had been over a year. After writing this novel full of every possible thing I could think of to help them retrieve my game, they wrote me back saying that I was SOL. Because I had never spent money on Quartz and I didn't know my username, they couldn't help me. All of my months and months of playing, rare servants and even items I won in events are now gone. I don't even think they tried. This is unacceptable. Not being able to link your account to anything is totally bogus. They do not value their customers. I sadly will not start over again. I spent too long playing the first time and I know I won't be able to get the same servants. I want my game back.",positive

"Used to enjoy this app, but now disliking this game more and more. Just like other people who have reviewed it, I find the rewards for playing alarmingly unfair, and well...unrewarding. Stingy gachas, an abundance of repetitive and useless craft essences, and rude customer service are sapping my enjoyment of this game. I think I'm going to stop playing. The clincher for me was these recent christmas events with Santa Alter and Santa Alter Lily . Basically, I played everyday, cleared all the quests (repeatedly, so I could spin the wheel), got all the enhancement materials from the spins (e.g the Gille de Rais dolls), but the wheel wouldn't drop the silver ticket for the actual hero. Thus, I ""didn't meet the conditions"" to keep the hero. WHAT?! Why doesnt the fact that I cleared the missions mean I earned the rewards, as it has in past events? If getting anything good really boils down to Fates miserly drop rate algorithm, I don't see the point in continuing to play.",positive

"First off, you can tell that the instructions, customer service responses, and event explanations are not written by someone who speaks English like most users.

Well technically, you could still get it back if you have specific info about your account by contacting with the support centre, and that takes ages for them to respond.

While the gacha rates are the worst I've seen (1% rate for a nonspecific 5 star servant), FGO makes up for it by making every servant (yes, even Phantom) that you get practically viable in finishing nearly every quest in the game. Some low star servants have very good skill sets in the game like FSN Cu, David, Billy the Kid, etc. Not to mention the free welfare servants we get in events. This is a permanent game in my phone which I will play until I die or the service ends. üòä",positive

Game is basically a scam when it comes to the gacha. Haven't summoned a gold servant in literal months. I understand it's all luck but the summon rates are actual garbage. Would delete if I didn't put money in it. Story is alright.,neutral
"The game is really f2p friendly and all servants can do pretty well in end game content and events. Everyone is useful even a 2* (like Hans).

Another problem is that I feel like the NA version should really start trying to catch up to the JP version.

Overall, great game but there's a lot of room for improvement.",positive

"Good game, the gacha is a soul breaking lie.",positive
it's honestly only good if you are already a fan of the Fate series. Drop rates are freaking horrible. it's incredibly repetitive and static in its character strengthening (which also takes forever). You can't really farm enough saint quarts for summoning in a timely way without paying for it. You don't even get enough stamina in a day to do all of the daily dungeons and go through an event at the same time. I would recommend the JP version but I can't fully get into it if I can't read it,positive

Half the time when I spend 200+ quartz on a summon to try and get a focus character I'm lucky to even get a single four star Servant. These gacha rates are literally the worst I have ever experienced in any mobile games I have played, especially since the cost to buy quartz is absolutely ridiculous. In short, the story and gameplay for this game are a lot of fun, but the gacha rates are truly abysmal and it really sucks my enjoyment out of the game.",positive

"Excellent game in my opinion. Love the storyline, and fate series as a whole. Its action, humor, and senpai!!! The game team is supet rewarding with saintz quarts (summon material) and generous with maintenace. It might take a,little time and to do it, but its easy enough to get summons without spending money. If you do spend money too its not a bad trade off for price. Over all an amazing game regardless of fate knowledge! Keep it coming!",positive
It was amazing I played it on my iPod before than it broke so I tried getting on PC it said it didn't support it after it allowed me to download it then I tried getting it on my phone but it never download the extra data it kept exiting the app and blaming it on my cache data,negative

Ok ill just start by saying as a person who loves the Fate series this is a good game to play the animations when you attack is smooth well most of the time and the art & animation of noble phantoms are even better but as a player I will say the role % for characters are too low and the cost for saint Quartz are way too high (Just my personal opinion ),positive

The game is great in it's entirety im just extremely dissapointed at the abyssmal state of its account recovery system as in it has none that can be seen formally. I've played the game alot and because I had to delete the app for reasons and because of how long i've played or waited for updates I've forgotten my password that's 2 accounts lost with alot of time and effort spent in it and all thats left is a bitter feeling and a useless identity transfer number.,positive
Pretty much just another point and click game. The story is very lackluster and pointless. Numerous plot holes exist and very little in terms of what is really happening in the game. New challenges that have been introduced show a high level of artificial contrivance that I have heard stories of players who are quite irritated with this game. Can't blame them. This game starts out weak and never really improves. Ignore it.,negative

"Very fun turn based strategy with many ways to combo super abilities, skills, buffs, It has a very interesting story so far with hundreds of unique characters(heroic spirits) to interact with, my only gripe with this game is the luck and crappy gacha system, as you can get duplicates or the same item material more then three times, sometimes special summons are just bait to get you to throw money at it, no, you can save a lot of quarts to spend later so having them saved only for important summons is a must... but that's about all I dislike over all a fun game.",positive

"TLDR; - The story gets better I promise, Learn to love the grind, You might as well max level those 3 stars cause you're probably not gonna pull that rate up 5 star, and don't play around your conservative grandparents. ******************************* It's nice to play a gacha game that you can do well on even without top tier 5-star servants - especially since the summon rates for 4 & 5 stars in FGO are utterly abysmal. Most F2P (or only occasional purchasers) will be relying on 1-3 star servants, so it was smart work on the developers part to keep even these low rank servants useful even on higher difficulty stages. Combine this with the games system of giving out a free servant to users who complete time limited events that are run multiple times throughout the year, and FGO is very F2P/dolphin friendly. *************************** Early story chapters can lag or just read like nonsense. While dialogue can be charming in places, don't be afraid to click through a characters monologue if it bores you, umu. Thankfully, the story picks up and gradually gets better and better after you push through the mess that is the Septem chapter. ******************************* The gameplay is heavily geared toward endless grinding, and there's No auto feature - so if you rely on that to play, don't bother. (Admittedly, the endless grinding does make it feel pretty dang good to finally max level a character though.) Most early stages can be completed by just powering through enemies, but later stages will start to require players to plan ahead and use skills carefully. ******************************** Lastly, the characters' designs and card art changing as they grow in power is a nice touch. I am, however, frequently left wishing there were a little less mostly naked busty women all over my screen, and no sexualized teenage girls at all. C'est la Japan?",positive

"Overall a very fun game but the gacha system is so bad that it would be more likely to be struck by lightning than getting a 5 star servant. It's literally at 1% so theoretically you would need to summon 100 times just to get 1 5 star servant and worst part is, it would most likely be a servant that you don't even want. To pour salt in the wound even more is the fact that it takes 30 saints quarts to do a 10x summon and the saints quarts are had to get without paying especially when you beat the game and you're waiting for the next chapter. So to conclude, the game is fun but only fun when you get the servants you want. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are a die hard fan. Extra note: If you think that the devs actually care about all the complaints and think that they are going to fix it.... They won't so it would probably be better to not even complain to them.",negative

The character acquisition in this game is atrocious the only way you can actually acquire certain characters. you want is by paying a large sum of money for saint quartz .Even then you might not get the character you want because the craft essence is also in the same pull.

Oh, and the tier lists are dumb, they are based on the current meta most of the time, so instead formulate your own opinions on servants, and look at the tier to see how they see some servants.

"Solid story, easy to grasp mechanics, relatively free to play and a solid addition to a very divisive but popular franchise that is brought down by the licensed company.  However, If you played and enjoyed the game, and decided to buy in game credits, you are better off doing so in the original Japanese version which give you better f2p rewards, and rewards newcomers. This version of the game (North America/SEA) has a terrible PR team, gives less rewards as compared to counterparts from other regions and PR/localization team doesn't respond to reviews/questions posed regarding this issues. Localization team also lacks communication with player base, uses outdated social media targets to ""rewards"" players while removing rewards from schedules (read above point) and claims ignorance or uses flimsy excuses to justify such actions. Game devs are basically nonexistent and announcements are delayed or announced in different media while not in sync, causing much confusion.

Games fun overall and is worth getting into if you're a Fate fan or just enjoy gacha games and RPG's. The only thing stopping me from giving this game 5 stars is the poor management of the NA version compared to the games JP counterpart.,positive

"This game may not win you over with its crappy rates, but it'll surely win you over when it comes to its gameplay and unique in-depth story line for both the main quest and bi-weekly event quests. You'll actually feel engaged with the game, as you should, compared to other games where you're only focused on drawing for some meta unit.",positive
A proper FATE franchise game for the fans and also for the franchise newcomers. Simple but stunning graphics with amazing animations and music that all tied within an intriguing original story. It is a gatcha reliant game with plenty of grinding necessary to progress but it is fine since the game is quite forgiving. Don't be mad about not getting that 5-star servant on their rate up banners because the percentage is still really low. Even 3-star servants that are free upon completing a singularity story can be powerful enough to get you through the missions and events if you invest in them hard enough. You will also be granted a random 4-star servant during the tutorial but your mileage with then can vary so it is up to you if you want to invest in that servant or not. Just save up for the quartz and tickets and roll during rate up banners for a higher chance of powerful servants. It is a slow burn but once you build a proper team you can take on any challenge without spending any real money on the game. Just remember that this game can be time consuming so I suggest looking for strategies online to help to play it more efficiently for your time and pace.,positive
Game's great if you can get over the gacha rate of 1% for 5 star servants. The 5 star servants are luxury servants and are not really needed for most gameplay as most 3 stars and lower can fill many of the roles 5 stars can. I am f2p with either crappy or stupidly good luck.,positive

Amazing and fun once you get used to it but yous should make it easier to get some of the characters you want,positive

"Tutorial is quick and easy, along with help buttons that remind of each menu's function. Servant affinity is present both in formation and battle menu, allowing for structuring parties if stages are haphazardly entered or for maximum utilization of strengths and opportunities.",positive
The game takes entirely way too long during the loading screens.. My phone keeps locking during gameplay. It's so annoying.. Unistall,negative
The devs are not kind to new players. New players dont get anything to try to help us catch up to people who have already been playing awhile. People decline friend requests because i dont have a max 5 star. Its just a game where if you were there from the start youre golden.,positive

"FGO has two things going for it so far: story and mash kyrielight. The story has kept me interested Otherwise, the UI is needlessly complex, the game has far too many and far too long loading screens, the ingame engine looks wonky with the 2.5D display, and the camera is hyperactive to the point where even a seasoned Wipeout/redout/f-zero veteran gets motion sickness. Overall probably 7/10",positive

RATE UP IS A LIE!! But overall the quality of the game is decent. Theres no real heavy power creep so if you play stop then return you wont be left in the dust. Well besides Merlin but thats another story.

good narrative,positive
"Hero collector based in the universe of Fate/stay night. Gameplay is very good; a kind of stripped-down Valkyrie Profile with considerable tactical and strategic depth. There's also plenty of content, including a meaty and still growing story campaign, frequent events, and well-written (though occassionally overlong) cutscenes. Having said all that, this is still a freemium game, with the usual annoyances: gatchas for new characters, multiple grinds to level them up, and stamina meters. Also a banal ""friends"" system which doesn't add social interaction but allows you to trivialize battles by borrowing some random whale's five-star. Definitely worth trying; whether or not you'll like it depends on your tolerance for freemium nonsense and your enjoyment of the franchise as a whole.",positive

No idea why it is so popular, there are much better turn-based, character building and rpg mobile games out there - such as Summoners War, SWG, Alliance Heroes Spire, Alchemists Code and others.",positive
"I've played the game for about a year maybe slightly more, but this Last MAJOR Maintenance delay causing me to miss my normal opportunities to keep my consistent daily log in streak coupled with not being able to advance in the main story as I'd like due to a lack of sufficient Experience cards from the gacha drops ( Which I always felt was a flaw with the game) has truly taken away the enjoyment I had for this game from when I first started playing. I'm still a fan of the Fate series itself but not the game anymore. I found myself just grinding on the limited event storylines just to collect all the exp cards and even then the gap in exp cards to gainable levels for my team still was just too much to enjoy the main storyline. Then there is the gachas that refuse ""regular saint quartz"" and will only accept ""paid with real money ONLY saint quartz"" I never had a problem paying and playing for a micro transaction but just the Audacity of it upset me when there was still the chance of not getting all the characters you wanted from one of those gachas for a price of a estimated $20 to $30 of real money that's ridiculous.",positive

"A fun game. Especially if you like the Fate series. There's a lot of fun to have with getting your waifus and husbandos. But the events are just too taxing in my opinion. They just keep coming and made it hard to focus on the actual story. Characters are great, I do wish they were a bit more balanced sometimes. Farming for materials gets old really quickly, especially for Hearts. In the end, I uninstalled because the game just took too much of my time away from me.

"The game is addicting and a lot of fun. My only real concern is your selfishness with 4 star and higher summons. I'm unsure WHY you guys refuse to guarantee a 4 star or higher servant on a 30 draw. The number people need is significant enough to properly boost their servants and so many different servants that it shouldn't be a big deal. I can almost 100% guarantee if you added a guaranteed 4 star or higher servant instead of 3 star in the 30 draw, not only would your players be happier, but you would make even more money than you are now. No other game I have ever played has been as selfish with their drop rates as this one, even Kingdom Hearts Unchained which is pretty greedy is more forthcoming with drops including a guarantee for most within a certain number of draws.",positive
The game would have been better if the gatcha wasn't salty and cold as the Pacific ocean.,positive
"This game is meta changing so there's a point you have to waste money, but chances of pulling 5 star are slim to none. Plus this game never guarantees anything. At least guarantee something for those who spend money.",positive
Good time dump and we'll crafted RPG for a mobile game,positive
"This is one of the few games that rewards you for knowing how to handle challenges, and doesn't make you feel bad for using a friend's servant.

Just like what you expect from a game that use RNG. Very low chance to get something decent while the story force you to fight mob above the safe level. 3* servants facing against Vlad with his vampirism. Please at least increase the drop rate for 3* servants and not only for CE.,positive

"Gacha will leave you with blue balls if you're fixated on pulling that one waifu/husbando during the banner pools. All salt aside, honest opinion. I never would have been captured by a this game so easily. - If you're a fan of the fate series, I would say it's worth checking out by itself. - If you like turn based games, lore, special appearances. I would recommend it. - The F2P choices available is fairly good surprisingly. - Pleasent grind in most aspects.",positive
"Worst kind of game. There is no way to get anything you actually want out of it without relying on a ton of luck or spending a ton of money. Even if you do spend a bunch of money you still get to live with a 1% drop chance. These kind of ""loot box"" games need to disappear from the market as they are designed from the ground up to be predatory and go after people that are addicted to gambling and people with poor impulse control that think that maybe next time they will get whay they want from the loot table. As a result in spite of being a fan of the fate properties I can't recommend this 'game' to anyone.",negative
"This game is awesome and I recommend it to everyone! I think there should be more historical accuracy with the Heroic Spirit's, but besides this small detail its excellent.",positive
The devs have no interest in allowing this game to run on Chromebooks. A pity since it looked like it might be fun.,positive

You can also go in F2P and grail (a type of limit-break system) a free 1,2, or 3* servant to level 100 if you wish, allowing any unit to become powerful. That's a definite plus!   Events frequently give out tons of rewards and unique, free 4* servants that come in 5 copies, but there is heavy playtime involved. If you're into games that reward invested time with a sense of pride and accomplishment (really) then dive right in.",positive

"It's a nice game, but for some reason Everytime I open it it downloads data, even if there are no updates. Is there a way to fix this or anything? My data plans are depleted for just one game session. Even if I select no when clearing the cache it still redownloads data.",negative
"The game is good overall but the gacha is so depressing... you collected quartz over the months but when it comes to the gacha roll with your favorite servant, you'll cry because your friends got it but you on the other hand is staring at the ""0 quarts left"".

It's an awesome game,positive
Wish that you would use the re-run versions of the events since the original versions were just tedious.,positive
I keep feeling the despair in gacha :/,negative
I absolutely love the gameplay and the ascension mechanic encouraging grinding to get materials like any good RPG. I do not even mind spending a little money for some extra Saint Quartz. I'd give the game a 5 if we could level up servants through combat and not just through combining them with other cards,positive
It's an awesome game just got to be careful of rolling for the servants you want. It may not go the way you want it.,positive

Too expensive to play. I prefer playing the game Brown Dust. That game gives a generous amount of gems to players.,positive
"This game is amazing. However, they overly sexualize the female characters. It's definitely not a game for children. The battle graphics are great, the characters are refreshing. It's super addicting.",positive
"My phone went kaput recently, so I desperately requested a transfer code...and was sent the wrong one. I've lost over a year's worth of good luck to an incompetent and unsympathetic support staff. All my progress gone. Why can't we have a login and password so we can easily move to any device? Whatever. Farewell, FGO, you taught me not to fly too close to the sun.",positive
I love this game but I hate how Japan gets everything 10x better than us while we get almost nothing like on the nerofest annoucement ... 3 saint quartz for 33k likes? Really now. If you're free to play go play the Japanese version and dont suffer like us,positive
GREAT time killer,positive
It's a good game challenging yet simple. U can use ur friends characters to help you through but be alot better if it had a way to save data to Google or Facebook would be great it's to easy to forget about transfer code,positive

Amazing game for Fate fans,positive
Thank you for creating such an addictive and story heavy game!,positive
"It an okay game, it crashed twice on me. Once while I was looking at what I had summoned to my team and second time while I was battling and that was during the second battle. So before I reinstall it back on my phone, please fix the problem. I really love the game though.",positive

The PRIME example of a predatory mobile game. with 1% ssr rate. You literaly have to spend hundreds(if not thousands) of dollars to get the new unit you want. Free currency is scarce as all hell - the worst in the business. Stay Far Away.,negative
"When i finished downloading it I opened the app and things were fine, but when i connected to another wifi source it wanted me to download again",positive
Love this game and the series itself. The first Fate/Stay Night was my very first anime and it saddens me a bit that only a few of the original characters are good servants to have. Fate's poster girl is not even that great of a servant... I'd love if it there was an event based of the original fate anime not just Fate/Zero. But all in all its a good game.,positive
"Awful drop rates, awful AP recharge the higher you level. Nothing but a cash grab. What's up with all the sexualized children? Not cool!",negative
Cool game and story but make rates higher the chance of pulling a 5 star is too low,positive
It was very fun,positive
"Long tutorials, no auto battles, takes too long just to take control of the game.",neutral
"A really great game that does base heavily on your money spent. Some 3/2‚òÜ servant is much better or have equivalent power to some 5‚òÜ servant. It also take your skills to the test on how you can win a battle or survive it. It's a turn-based and strategy game btw. In terms of events, it doesn't matter if you didn't even watch/play the Fate franchise as the events does not or have a little part on the event. This game take hours, days and years to have a full working team.",positive
"Joined the day it released. Huge Fate series fan. But the currency is a pain to earn and save, and they started releasing gatcha you can only play with BOUGHT currency. What a slap in the face.",positive

The one thing i didliked about this game was the ap it takes too long to replinish but besides that i love this game i play it too much lol,positive
"Nowhere near engaging enough to warrant the time investment it necessitates. The writing and visuals aren't bad by any means, but the gameplay, while engrossing at first, quickly loses its charm once you recognize you'll be making every small decision during every small fight.

The struggle,negative
Its a great game and the story is really interesting that it motivated me to wait for the two f/go movies. At first the gacha might be frustrating but once you get a good servant its really worth it. The game is also a lot deeper than what you see there are tons of combinations for your lineup.,positive
Advice give this game a link to a email instead of a transfer code less ppl will lose there accounts,negative
I uninstalled the game because it started to mess up my phone. I can't get my account back even I linked it. Can Google play do anything to help? I really liked the game and i even emailed fate go support. Can you help maybe with some of the information of my account?,positive
I like the the game. The graphics are pretty decent and the game play is fun. The story is great. But Everytime I launch the app it says it didn't launch right and I have to install the game again.

I'm not a big fan of games like this but this in particular has changed my mind! It's definitely fun! But lately there has been event after event and it's a bit hard to keep up with.

"All you need to know: This game involves Gachas Waifus Many, many tears That 5 star character you'll never get Amazing paid currency prices Addictive clickety leveling up of characters (exuberantly exhorting when you level them) BUT... Through it all, you will never regret You will save your quartz, roll, not get the character that you want *character rates are abysmal. And still, you love it so much. Because that's what it is. The never ending chase of the thrill. Adapted lore with ridiculous twists that leave you in awe at the end. Looking at the characters you've managed to get, & still, realising they're not so bad after all. For this is your fight And they are your warriors They will give their heart and soul (literally) to fight for you Isn't that enough? Fate Grand Order: The game that eats one's heart and soul. If you're ready, it's a trip to take you'll never look back on. Save, summon, GO! *Word of caution: Rate up is still a lie",positive

The only complaint I have is that a lot of stuff seems geared towards men, especially the summer event. Girls play too, you know, and some of us don't appreciate being called a gentleman.

First time with Gacha game. Love it!!!,positive
This rpg game gets addictive with its storyline. Not to mention some funny one liners.,positive
"It's a wonderful and addicting game, the pacing of the story and difficulty allows one to get into the more complex methods of the combat system while not feeling thrown in brusquely. The Gacha system is more fair then many say, as while and 4* and 5* are pretty rare, there are plenty of 3* that are much better then some of them in their class, hell the only better rounded support then. Hans is Waver, and even then Hans has uses Waver doesn't. Even outside of gameplay the game excels my expectations with the story, it manages to keep stakes high while also keeping things comedic when need be. There's also the factor of constant events being used to gain more resources and even more units, not to mention good units such as Rider Kintoki or Chloe Von Einzbern, one of the best Buster Crits and on of the best Arts Crits units in the game so far.",positive
"As stated by previous reviews, gacha is highway robbery. This won't affect you too much cause the game can be played with the low star servants (Unless you're really after a 5 star waifu then you're probably better off buying physical merch). It has events that give you free servants if you participate actively. Beware though because the gacha is the beginning, the game is pure farming hell. P.S. PLAY ONLY IF YOU HAVE SPARE TIME.",positive
Rawr,neutral
"Basic easy turn based action makes for a good game I can play while watching TV or whatever but they are so reluctant to give you premium currency it takes forever to build up enough to buy the deal with the guaranteed 4 star character that it's not even close to worth putting in the time, to the point where it almost feels like you have to dump money into it to get characters but then you realize that the drop rates are so incredibly low that you would have better luck emptying your bank account in the slots at a bar.",positive

No support for Android P. Only app that doesn't work. Support gave me a generic response and didn't address the questions asked. Update: six months later and the official Android P/9.0 release has rolled out. Still isn't supported. Still don't have issues with ANY other applications.,negative
Great game. Lots of the characters from Fate that you've come to love whether or not you've seen the Anime/Mangas/Novels it will surely suck you in if your into turn based games,positive
"For what it is, for free, it's a good time waster. Unfortunately much like 
all gacha games, it suffers with perpetual rare draw spam events utilizing 
fractional percent drop rates and high amounts of premium currency. What's 
worse is that there IS NO DATA BACKUP. The available recovery system is a 
joke to try and process, let alone find since I had to look through Reddit 
and different forums posts through Google to find the right channels. 
Unless you've burned every detail and stat of your game and characters to 
memory, you'll have no luck through support. Obviously, this game also does 
not support Google Play's cloud for data backup. If you spend any money on 
the game, you are also flat out told there can be no exceptions, you must 
either have updated information burned into your mind or a phone that isn't 
broken (in my case, my screen shattered and any attempts to blindly 
navigate into the phone via software was a failure). It's a very risky game 
you shouldn't devote a lot of time into, but is worth a try if you're 
looking for a flashy waste of your idle time. There's definitely better 
options out there, which I've moved onto, but it's sad that a series I've 
enjoyed thoroughly has such an awful mobile game market adaptation. Guess 
that's just what becomes of well known titles these days.",negative
This game is a must have for all FSN fans and even those who like turn-based strategy games. The game is also full of well-made storylines (little-to-no spoilers to the main anime).

"You can pass on the basic till the very end of the game with your very 
first character pull (If you can hold on to it that long). You can also try 
to collect other good character, but the thing is that, its pure gambling 
with horrendous rates, like when you put your love and passion, with a 
chance of throwing $100 and you get either insult or just plain out abysmal 
self awareness in style of anime, trying to make fun of you who spend your 
hard earned cash (Don't know why the community feels fine to this insult)

frequency) usually give away a fairly strong Servant. If you're not

there is just so much quality on display here.",positive

"This game has a great story, decent gameplay, and best of all, its single 
player so pay2win is not an issue. That said, the drop rate for rare 
servants is horrendous at just 1%, although you can clear the game with 
lower rarity servants. There is a reason this game ranks among the top 
grossing games and that is due to the expensive gambling system that is 
implemented. If obtaining the rare servants were made easier or more 
affordable, this game would be a 5‚òÜ and instant classic. 4‚òÜ from me.",positive

story. It's free to play but doesn't have any nuisances pestering you to 
pay-- the game is completely playable with the characters you get for free, 
and pulling on the gacha is just bonus. I kinda fell off from playing, but 
only because it was getting to be a bit of a slog. It takes a fair bit of 
grinding to fully level up and skill up your Servants, and also there is a 
lot of story to read through. The writing is generally alright, but after a 
long day of work sometimes I just don't want to read 20,000 words about 
Francis Drake (waifu version). That's not a fault with the game, but with 
myself. That said, however, I would watch an anime about Jeanne Alter.",positive

after a while the game gets extremely dull, having you do the same thing 
over and over again. Combat is too repetitive, load times are long and 
annoying, events are okay but tiresome when it follows the same format over 
and over, 4 and 5* servant rates abysmal and are stuck behind a sea of 
useless craft essence (seriously I have only gotten 1 4* servant this 
year), prices for quartz is way too expensive (never bought any), the only 
thing that keeps people playing is the fact it's a Fate game.",negative

minutes ago with my mobile data. At this point, it'll continuously ask me 
to check my mobile connection and retry or restart, and unless I connect to 
a faster network it won't fix, and even if it does it'll only work for a

also need stronger cards! U will get friends points most of the time but u

bonds. I have nothing bad to say about this game. I would highly suggest 
downloading it. You will not be disappointed. The only thing I have a

"I get why some people hate the gacha system since it means that they are 
less likely to get the characters they want, however in my opinion the game 
is quite balanced. Rarer characters require alot more materials before they 
get all their skills. Besides the game can still be beat with the common 
serveants, some of the best serveants are common or free serveants. Some 
people are also upset that the english server is behind the japanese server 
but I am fine with that as it allows for me to plan ahead of time and gives 
me time to do other things. Though I do wish that some qualitty of life, 
graphics and animations are updated int the english server earlier.",positive

Rubish draw rates,neutral
"I rated this a 4 star cause it has a good story, good graphics, and its a 
hard game that challenges these players. And why did i not rate it a five 
star?. Cause you need to spend money in this game to become strong and its 
so expensive and S.Q is hard to get/earn for, while us players grinding 
everyday to become strong neither during or without an event we try to earn 
our S.Q to buy that 30 S.Q thingy and try to get the card that we want 
while some of us players get lucky while some players dont and thats where 
the balance of this game cuts off and this is the part where i explain why 
this game is almost paid to play related whenever an event starts or even 
without an event...(btw im not saying that i hate this game cause of what 
im saying) the unfairness of some players that dont spend money on this 
game and the players that spend money on this game is where the balance 
cuts off for example one time i saw this paid S.Q event and there i was 
like okay ima grind but when i read it again i was like how can i get a 
five star card if its so rare (especially this game involves gambling or 
A.K.A test ur luck cause youre giving away youre S.Q and try to get cards) 
and this was the one time i thought i was gonna get a five star BUT u need 
to pay to get a guranteed 5 star in this event and i dont have the money to 
buy S.Q and my favorite Card was there too and thats where the balance of 
this game ticks off. But its a good game but it also needs to make the game 
fair to the no spend users with or without a event thank you and have a 
good day",positive
it is nice but this wont work on my device oppo a83,positive
"This game deserves a one star due to the awful business practice of 
separating paid crystals from free crystals, then having summons where you 
have a guaranteed chance to get something good, but only if you drop like 
$30 on it. I'll spend money when I really enjoy a game, but it puts me off 
completely when there are summons like this that only favor the whales, 
when the whales already naturally have a huge advantage. It's sad, because 
it's a good game, but they really show you how little you're worth to them 
if you only want to drop $10-$15 here or there. You can drop the large 
amounts or deal with nothing.",positive

"Lots of people complaining about not getting their accounts back. Just want 
to say that everytime I have had any issue with my account the staff have

get my account back to me. So I dont understand all the complaints about 
the support team. Just saying they've been great to me everytime I have had 
to interact with them. (Make sure to make a transfer device code and keep 
the info!) Also some people are complaining about not getting what other 
servers had get compared to ours. Why are you complaining just play on the 
other servers then ... now onto my actual review. I love the game, but I do 
not think this is a easy game for people who are not able to put a lot of 
time investment into it. You can beat most content with any characters you 
choose but getting that character there is a long long long long long 
grind. Now the gacha rates are terrible less than one percent for your 5 
star summons. Now personally I like this. Don't hate me for my point of 
view but i LIKE the rareness of the heroes of this game. It actually feels 
special to pull that hero you want and even more devastating when you dont 
(MHX T.T)... But on the other hand I was surprised at how good mash has 
become, was suprised that my 4 star servants from events are actually good 
too. The latest update on the story blew me away... I loved it. Most of the 
events are fun, and I love the characters... if your a fan of type-moon its 
a must play. If your brand new to type moon i hope you enjoy the game like 
I have. thanks everybody involved in giving this game to us. PS. I Want the

predatory rates for the Gacha machine. The general results of each pull

said to be poorly made (it has a very nice concept, I do not recommend it

pull. It won't end well for you.",positive

"Started playing this game since January of 2018 and haven't stopped since. 
Being a f2p player especially has its merits because the game is very harsh 
on you with gacha rates allowing players to realize that some low star 
servants can be really good too. With a pretty unique battle system, there 
is lots of strategy involved in every battle that you have. Now that I've

the story is fantastic and there are plenty of events that keep the game

for a certain person ($700 usd for jalter lol), however money spent is 
justified since the balance in this game is amazing. Every character you go 
for roll stay relevant many many years to come so your money is 
justified.... Basically a waifu simulator with good gameplay and story 
elements.",positive

"I'm really enjoying the game so far, I've cleared the story and can't wait 
for more. It's nice to have a few of my favourite servants and get to see 
brand new ones- the profile pages are incredibly informative and 
interesting. In 9-12 months, if I don't have a 5* servant, then I'll start 
to complain about the summoning rates. UPDATE: received my first two 5* 
servants in under 6 months of playing. Very happy with this gacha rate. 
This game is less strategic at the beginning due to the Support Servants 
basically clearing whole rounds, but by the middle of the story content 
you'll find yourself needing to use a lot of tactical thinking and take 
into account what type of enemies you'll be fighting to plan out effective 
strategies. My only complaint is that the game is constantly (once every 
1-2 hrs.) giving me notifications telling me that my energy is full when it 
isn't. All around a great game, will absolutely recommend to my friends and 
family.",positive

The game to roll for your waifus and husbandos.,neutral
Greatest game ever,positive
"While the few first few chapters or singularities dont have the greatest 
story, in fact pretty average. Camalot, the 6th singularity, blew me away. 
The pacing was great along with superb character development that not only 
made the singularity's supporting cast likable, but made the main 
antagonist understandable. The writing is colorful and briming with 
entertainment, this is even more true with events where usually the serious 
tone is droped for a more comedic one. As for gameplay. While the game does 
have a strategically design. You wont really have any trouble until the 6th 
singularity, where stragies start to matter more and you cant mindlessly 
force your way through everything. But it is still fun and engaging either 
way, simply more challenging after the 6th singularity. The character 
designs are wonderful and if youre a fan of natsuverse, (fate/anything, 
kara no kyokai, ect); most of these characters and more are here. More 
being added regularly. So you can get your favorite character or find new 
ones. But the gacha has a very low chance on giving you the rare waifu 
characters some would want unless you are willing to use some cash. But 
even the low tier (essentially free) servants (characters) are usefull 
(some dramatically better than the rare waifus). Cu is best bro in every 
way possible btw, only guy I would be with if I was gay. Overall this is 
the only phone game that I have not and plan on not droping unlike so many 
others and would recommend this to any one that has intrests in anime or 
simply would want a time sink.",positive

"Normally I don't take to gacha games easily - I get frustrated and lose 
interest fast, it's not uncommon for me to uninstall a game within days, if 
not hours. But I won't lie, I think I've found a gem in this game. I heard

the available characters. I'm very much invested in the story and I can't

has been out for years and we have a dang good roadmap, but I can't wait to 
personally experience it myself.",positive
"It's ok if u want to burn time. It was recommended to me by my brother 
cause we both like the anime but it is da*n near impossible to get any 
character you actually want. It is mostly cross your fingers and hope you

love for the series but trying to get a decent 4-star servant like Nero 
Claudius saber alter or saber Lily is whey tedious and annoying also 
there's no other way to retrieve your data but all and all its a good game",positive
"I love this game. The combat system is elegant and throws just the smallest 
bit of strategy into every move. The graphics are beautiful. The gacha has 
terrible chances, but I never spend money on mobile games so i resigned 
myself to luck to begin with. The biggest flaw, as many have stated, is 
that it crashes constantly with Android. Every story mission has caused 
crashes. I'll wait a few days, then, if i try with an amazing data speed, i 
can play a mission, then it crashes on the next one. Leaving the review 
mainly to state that whatever issue there is with Androids isn't exclusive 
to this newest OS update. I'm running Android 6.0.1 and i have the same 
issue. TL;DR The Android crash problem is also happening on my 6.0.1 OS so 
the problem isn't just the newest update.",positive
"If game is accidentally uninstalled without writing down transfer code you

boring grind.",positive

"The gameplay is rather intuitive for a turn-based system, and it never really feels like I have to rely too heavily on premium servants. In fact, what really sets this game apart from your typical gacha game is how well the budget servants compete with the premium ones. Though there is an advantage to getting said servants, it is completely unnecessary no matter what stage of the game you're in. The events are also pretty enjoyable and makes it a lot easier for beginners to progress.  Normally I dislike energy systems in games because I don't like being told when I can and can't play, but as long as you still have story content to plow through, you probably won't run out anytime soon. Sadly enough, there are daily login enticements, but they won't take up more than 5 minutes of your time, and the daily quests aren't necessary either (unless there's a servant you need to level).  The story is not great, but not bad either. It does have some interesting plot elements and the characters are okay. I haven't progressed to that point just yet, but I heard Nasu himself (the original creator of Fate) does write the later parts of the story, and I'm pretty hyped for that!",positive
Its pretty fun!,positive

Great story. Good gameplay. Gacha hell. You know when you finished the main quest then have new servants and wanted to try out new strategies on the main bosses or want to just have fun replaying those? I don't.,positive
"It's really frustrating. I put a lot of time and money into this game, but 
my phone broke, and since I didn't have a code written down that I didn't 
even know existed, I can't recover. I have the same Google play account, 
Facebook, etc. But this game uses none of those, so there's just no way for 
me to recover what I lost. I miss playing it, but I'm not willing to 
restart after all of that.",negative

environment, what does this even mean?",negative
"It installs but when i go to open the app its pulls up my email app and had 
a emial composed to the game",neutral
"Amazing game for any fan of the nasuverse franchises. Plenty enjoyable and 
addictive, enough so that I've played it every day since the first week of 
release. Starting out is tough while adjusting to game mechanics and 
beginning your everlasting war with the relentless gacha, but everything is 
smooth sailing once you land a handful of SR and SSR heroes. For serious 
players, whaling helps, but a good schedule can overshadow it",positive
"I love this game, but now it just won't open anymore. It keeps downloading 
even after I've already done it once, and it takes longer and longer each 
time. I don't have time to wait for this, so now I just can't play it.",neutral
"Starts fun. Plot gets almost impossible around Act 3. Character level cap 
means you can't just grind up additional levels without farming materials, 
some of which aren't available until you advance the plot. I end up relying 
on ""friends"" with level 90 chrs more than i should. Edit: recent updates 
have made this a crashfest. Difficulty of latest plot level seems designed 
to force you to use saint quartz to complete levels. Unskippable animations 
make this game an adjunct to some other activity. Maybe I'm just over it 
but it's not fun any more.",negative

"This game does so much right, sadly it does even more wrong. Hands down the 
worst gacha system available. Terrible rates guarantee you wont get your 
waifu unless you are extremely lucky or spend a lot of money. They are 
extremely stingey with free quartz and the rates mean even the few free 
draws you get will be worth nothing. Even if you save for a 10 roll with 
free quartz you cant help but think 'that was 30 dollars worth of quartz, 
for nothing.' Do yourself a favor and play Granblue instead.",positive

Simply fantastic!,positive
I've really no reason to hate this game.,negative
"Overall a good game where you have to think about what you're doing and 
can't just autopilot the way through. Balance is alright and while the 
Gacha System is too unforgiving in my opinion, it is very possible to clear 
the required or even challenging content without spending a dime.",positive

This is a clear attempt in forcing players to spend before the discount on 
quartz packs we all know are coming. I will never, ever forgive aniplex for 
this. Boycott Aniplex!",negative
"Beautiful, seamless game with great mechanics. Love the story line. Love 
that this game doesn't force you to do in app purchases. Love that 
developers put thought into every detail to cater for even people on the go 
whereby if you exit the game in the middle of a battle you have an option 
when you load the game to start back from that very point that were in the 
battle. Great job!",positive
"This one has some big pros and big cons. Short version: it's big, fun, and 
interesting, but pricey if you're a waifu collector. The bad stuff first. 
An obnoxious energy system that pretty harshly limits play time (items can 
mitigate this). A lot of the art, while definitely high quality, is aimed 
squarely at the teen boy audience. Very few women in GO (or gender-swapped 
men, which are quite common) seem to have working knowledge of pants. An 
overpriced gacha system with the odds I think I've ever seen. It costs 3 
bucks for a single summon with a 1% chance of landing a 5 star character. 
If you're prone to getting hooked on rng, I'd suggest you stay away from 
this one. The good It's got tons of content, and you don't have to pay if 
you don't want to.You can get through even the high end gameplay without 
those pricey 5 stars. Solid strategy gameplay and art, as long as you're 
down with the T&A. Free summons, as long as you're patient. The odds still 
suck. Tons of events and free characters that are actually quite good. A 
story, though the writing is often...odd. It's very japanese, and so prone 
to having things get lost in translation.",positive
Best fate game ever,positive
I love the game and as a Fate fan you did really a great job well done,positive
"For now its good. I can clear the whole story as f2p. Im here for the 
story. i love the okeanos part. Maybe add some side story about the 
servants i think it will be a good idea to put in the game and i like the 
idea of world boss we cleared in onigashima. Aside from that you should 
also change the drop rates for the ascension materials in the daily quests. 
ALl in all good game. Aside from the rate of the gatcha",positive

requires lots of grinding and effort if you want to maximise events-based 
rewards ingame.",negative
"I play over on the JP version, and I'll tell you, it doesn't get much 
better in the gacha department. I liked that this version had some QoL 
changes (that JP got much later on) from the get go, putting players at a 
better advantage than JP had starting out. Content can be cleared with any 
rarity servant; takes putting effort into team building and leveling those 
servants to their utmost. The one change that the gacha needs to do, to 
head in a better direction, is separate craft essence and servants",positive

"Let me preface this by saying I've found myself wanting to whale on the 
regular. I'm seriously hooked on this game. Other than having a very 
memorable character (Arturia Pendragon) being incorrectly named Altria (A 
Tobacco Company) this game is very addicting, pun intended, and the visuals 
are stunning. Maybe they'll fix the spelling for the legendary king of 
knights in an update eventually. The Saint Quartz used to summon heroic 
spirits (odds are crazy hard, so getting a 5‚òÜ servant is VERY satisfyingly) 
are ridiculously over priced and there is an over abundance of QP through 
AP quests. Unfortunately, there is no way to exchange QP for Saint Quartz. 
This would be another great update idea (Exchange QP for Saint Quartz in 
the store?). I'm continually waiting for my AP to recharge while cringing 
every time I summon another Demon Boar. Keeping all the things above in 
consideration, this game is seriously the best mobile game I've ever 
played. The story's constantly being updated with an endless amount of 
things to do.",positive

up on pulling ssrs unless you have over 300 quartz. It feels like there is

"It's really good & I'm loving everything but the way the MTX is used, while 
I can understand why it's currently like it is now I wish it was split up 
to be able to roll randomly between each of the classes & CEs so it's 
better easier for players to have a chance to get what they want & not feel 
discouraged from playing cause of the MTX & RNG not playing in there favor 
& it feeling like & being wasted time and money also a slight decrease in 
the saint quarts needed to roll higher then 1 is also needed, if not any of 
that please give us a way to purchase servants directly, I love this game 
but more often than not I find myself not playing it cause I feel like I'm 
not getting everything I wanted out of it & that's purely cause of the way 
its MTX is structured, as a fan who wants to enjoy your game & support it 
please consider changing it.",positive

Wish there was multiplayer!,positive
"Fate/Grand Order gets a 5* for gameplay, and 1* for the monetization. The 
TL;DR version is that you should either plan on playing mostly free, or 
""whaling"" it and spending $100s maybe $1000 or more. To me, the value for 
your money is rather low. It's a blast to play, with a depth that rivals 
most PC games. From team composition to strategizing a battle, you will 
need to think hard when you need to maximize your performance. Also, I find 
the game's audio and visual detail to be great for a mobile game. FYI, it's 
voiced in Japanese and subtitled in English, with many ""visual-novel""-like 
cut scenes for the story aspects. However, the payment model is mostly 
based around a random ""gacha"" pool mechanic (i.e., pulling cards randomly 
from a deck). The odds of getting the best servant (5*) in the game is only 
1% per pull, and the chance for even a 4* is just 3%, so don't expect to be 
pulling them a lot. In fact, to even expect to pull one at all is a 
stretch. You'll get free pulls by playing, and maybe I've been lucky since 
I've managed 2 within 2 months. But here's the thing, if you want to buy a 
pull, each will cost in the range $1.71-3.00 (the cheapest if you buy in 
quantities of $80 at a time). And in comparison, if you buy $80 worth 
(which I equate to half a year of MMO subscription, or maybe a deluxe 
edition of a AAA PC game), you get almost 50 pulls. The odds of getting one 
or more 5* are just around 40%. And even if you include the odds of getting 
a 4 or 5*, it's just 87%. That's a lot of money for not a lot of outcome. 
Secondly, your play time is limited by an action point (AP) pool that 
scales linearly with your level. ANd I find my playtime once I reached high 
enough to start farming dailies to be significantly gated by this. In fact, 
at max level, you can only do (almost) 4 of the ""best"" dailies before 
running out of AP, and at my level after 2 months, can only do about 3. You 
get back AP at 1 per 5 min, and you can get a full pool by leveling up, so 
I find myself trying to optimize when I level. You can buy a full pool for 
$0.60-1.00, but to me, spending that much for maybe at most 15-30 min of 
playtime is just too much. It reminds me of the days when I played in an 
arcade.... Finally, in order to advance your servants, you'll have to 
farm/grind for materials, and this to me gets very tedious. Since drops are 
random, and you are never guaranteed a particular one, you can find 
yourself running the same mission over and over again with no apparent 
progresss, all the while spending your precious AP and having to stop when 
you're out. You'll find events are your best bet here, but since each are 
limited time and you need to get pretty advanced in one for the best mats, 
you'll find yourself needing to grind them out too. It's a shame that such 
a fun game is relegated to the ""mobile game monetization"" model, and 
moreover, that they've decided to tilt towards ""whales"" (i.e., those who 
spend tons of money) over a more casual playerbase. I'd certainly be 
willing to spend $5-10/month on this game, but that really gets you almost 
nothing except for certain times (I hear there are guaranteed pull events 
occasionally). My recommendation is that new players, unless you are 
expecting to be a ""whale"", play for free for at least a month or two, and 
get to about level 70+ along with a roster of free servants that are about 
level 40-50 before deciding on spending any large amount of money.",positive
why i cant play this game.??im in philipines,negative
"Being permanently behind JP server sucks. Other servers are catching up, so 
why cant we? Regarding the game, it's cool. Gacha may be hell, but as 
someone playing for only a month with 3 5 stars, I can definitely say it's 
all by chance. Getting a Scath after the update with 1 try using a summon 
ticket is pure luck too. Once you get those 5 stars you wanted anyway you'd 
realize 3 stars and below are also useful and strong. It just depends on 
how you plan your team. Though craft essences are a must and it's really 
hard to get a specific one that you need.",positive

"2 complaints: 1st. The game likes to freak out when I place my device in 
USB Debugging mode, I'm sure there's a completely legitimate reason to 
block access to the game if a phone is in Debugger mode, but does it really 
need to open 20 Gmail applications in an attempt to send a debug email? And 
for clarity, I am a starving programmer and use my personal device for app 
development, which is why my phone is in USB Debug mode. 2nd. The combat is 
awe strikingly unique, but if I accidentally hit the hit button to choose 
my combat cards for my Servants, I'm locked into the attack mode without 
being able to back out and select skills, which is both annoying and 
disappointing. P.S. I love the game, the art, the story, the everything, 
besides those 2 complaints above and am looking forward to play more.",negative

character (rate that is stated in-game). The prices for Saints Quartz (the 
in game currency used for summons) are much higher than any other gatcha 
games' currency and earning enough free Saint Quartz to summon takes far 
too much work just to attempt a summon and end up getting ten 3 star 
characters you've already gotten dozens of times in the friend points

"Hello, just an honest review of the game so far. Been playing for a few 
months since last Halloween and I can honestly say it is one of the best 
gacha games I have played. I will admit that there are some problems such 
so bugs, small translation errors, and the gacha drop rate is gacha hell.. 
With a 1% drop rate for 5 star servants, its much worse compared to other 
gacha games. If you're cheap to play, might as well wait for the 
anniversary or thanksgiving/new years gacha for a guaranteed 5 star. The 
grind can be a bit repetitive but taking a break can help ease that 
feeling. With that out of the way, the story, characters, and even events 
are all very good and side stories or interludes as they're called are 
pretty fleshed out and reward you for playing. And the easier to get or 
free servants from events are pretty damn good, and with good strategy and 
team building you can get through some pretty tough content. Overall a 
great solid gacha game that you should play BUT roll RESPONSIBLY.... The 
rates are hell. Just wish the campaigns they do were much better with more 
rewards for free to play.",positive

"This version of app lag 2 years behind the original JP release, take that

"One of the few games I have no regrets paying real money to. The game is 
awesome. The events are great and the support is super. The only thing I am 
disappointed about so far is not getting my oni! Lol!;) That said may I 
suggest a slight mod to the ticket system; regular tickets being handled as 
they are now. Silver tickets with an increased chance of high level 
characters. Gold tickets good for 4-5 star characters awarded by special 
events. And diamond or platinum tickets good for a character of your 
choice. My thoughts. Keep up the great work!",positive
"Horrible game unless you can afford to pay $500+ for a good Servant. The

"Until AniplexNA and Delight Works gets their stuff together, I would not recommend anyone purchase stuff from this game. While it's a good game, especially for anyone who is already invested into Fate series, the NA version of this game suffers from horrible management compared to the Korean, Chinese and Taiwanese versions.   Firstly, the translations are outsourced to free lance translators. Many times the English translations are sub-par and suffer from glaring faults; It's as if no one reviewed it before publishing them. Secondly, our rewards are reduced, and sometimes even outright removed compared to the other regions. For example, in one of the events, Rashomon, we were supposed to get an additional limited skill upgrade material and a summoning ticket however they were removed completely. Thirdly, we have no absolutely no communication with the NA team in regards to any of this. They only post on their Facebook page with promotional events and our quartz giveaways are locked behind huge Facebook milestones which are ever increasing. Which does not happen in any other region.  There are many other problems with the NA release that needs to be addressed.",negative

"Been playing for some months now and I'm enjoying the game. I honestly am 
surprised a Gacha game has been so good and has an amazing story with 
alluring waifus with huge plot. The grind drops when a new Event comes out 
and I like it. Only thing of course is FTP is not easy especially if you 
want some SSR servants. The general game content can be beat with the most 
common and easily acquired servants so that's great. Love the community 
too, always providing tips and helping out noobs like myself.",positive

"Being a fan of the Fate Series, this game is easily one of the best games 
I've played so far. The animation of all characters are unique and epic, 
and the voice lines are awesome. The storyline is also extremely exciting, 
one example is the Fate/Zero Accel Order event storyline. It uses OSTs from 
the Fate/Zero anime so it gives me a sense of nostalgia, making me want to 
rewatch it again. The storyline also got me at the edge of my seat (Yeah 
that's just how good this game is!) Not only that, the Customer Support 
deserves to be praised. I experienced a small issue and emailed them and 
they replied to me really fast, double thumbs up! All in all, man this game 
is just too good to be true, definitely recommended!! (Btw the only thing 
the devs must work on is the 5 Star Servant drop rates... Seriously, the 
drop rate is so low that u could only probably get 1 5-Star Servant after 
about 1000 summons I guess)",positive

"This is quite honestly the only bloody game where you can dump 40 or more 
dollars into a summon style gimmick and get nothing useful. I've played 
since this games release and I still haven't gotten a 5 star hero despite 
multiple attempts at ""boosted rate"" draws. Call it bad luck or rigged 
rates, it doesn't matter, either way I'm done with this game, every useless 
5 star craft essence I see makes me hate this game more knowing that it 
could've been a hero, any 6 of them could have been a hero instead and I 
would've at least been satisfied having a single top tier character. But 
it's been many months and a lot of regret so I must say goodbye fgo, 
hopefully others enjoy you more than I have. Suggestions I have are maybe 
allowing for guaranteed 4 star servants with 30 quartz draws, decreasing 
drop rates for CE's, improve your dollar to quartz conversion rates, but 
whether or not you listen is irrelevant since no one will likely read this 
or even consider it because it will decrease profits.",positive

irritated me is the SSR and even SR drop rate is too low compares to other

ingame money, so prepare yourself.",positive

happens it keeps in requesting need more space and now i try to uninstall 
it even i dont want to ..such a waste of time keeping this app if you can 
minimize the amount of mb needed i think this app can be awesome",positive
"It's fun, has a surprisingly interesting story for a gatcha, and has a good 
deal more strategy than your average mobile game. It does, however, crash 
occasionally on my device (a relatively new ""Viking Pro"" Android tablet). 
Tech Support/Customer Service is excellent, restoring my brother's account, 
which had been lost through some mishap with his phone, in less than 24 
hours. Rolling gacha frequently is not required, and any purchases you will 
be making are all but guaranteed to be because you want a particular 
character, and not to increase your team's power, as time and dedication 
rather than gacha collection, is necessary to level up your characters. 
That being said, the Support and in-game friend system can be used, making 
the game playable without any grinding whatsoever. Overall, I highly 
recommend Fate/Grand Order to anyone already familiar with the series, even 
if they would not like the self-insert fantasy wish fulfillment one tends 
to expect from these sorts of games. Though it is very true that some of 
the characters would benefit from wearing more clothes, even the 
protagonist is a unique character, and the story fits well into the overall 
franchise. Despite the occasional bout of tedium from battling waves of 
anemones, this is overall an excellent game and definitely worth a download.",positive

story can be either be humorous or gripping at any moment but the tone is 
always on point whenever the story gets tense as man times the stakes get

to play this game as it is a gripping tale filled with ups and downs, 
victories and defeats, and most important of all this game will suck you in

"Fate Grand Order. Summoning Heroic Spirits of the past to save all of 
humanity, and deal with never ending shenanigans. This game has story and 
heart much like a visual novel, only with the added kick of being able to 
build your own team of heroes(?) to save the world. You can easily feel 
each character that you aquire as you use them, being far more than random 
cookie-cutter 'heroes' from other games that have little more than a 
sentance to explain them. The game itself has pleanty of heroes that can be 
aquired, but while the 5* servants are the best in overall ability, you 
don't actually need the strongest to survive or get through the story (they 
just make it easier). That and your 'friend' list will no doubt have some 
spirit that will more than make up for heroes you dont have. You play 
smart, and even 'weak' servants can be strengthened to fight at the end 
game. Even if you have never heard of Fate before now, you can easily get 
into this game without knowing anything, and you can still follow along 
easily. Its a good game and I recommend it.",positive

"The game has attractive visuals during gameplay, however, the art for 
character cards (or even character pertaining to the story) are 
inconsistent and some outright look bad. The Gameplay is solid and does the 
basic level to keep interest but eventually it grows stale after so long. 
Feeling as though each experience of the Gameplay is the same, no matter 
which enemy you face. The currency for summoning could also use some work. 
While I understand that they are a business and do need to make profits, I 
feel as though they have incorporated a currency that takes weeks to get 
the required amount to summon 11 characters, and it feels more like a chore 
rather than a system of progression. It's rather easy to get the currency, 
but if you want to learn about the story, it takes much longer than it 
should. Since you have to beat 5+ missions (further into the game) to just 
get one of them, it becomes a hassle and is unfulfilling. Add in the time 
it takes to read everything, which can drone on endlessly, to fill in time 
to make the game feel longer. Skipping the story shortens the time it takes 
significantly, though it's not good if you're more encouraged by the game 
to skip it's own story. Which is what the game implies when interactions 
between characters can take up to 10 minutes to read and barely any 
progression in the story or character development occurs. Lastly, I am 
disappointed with how they incorporated dialogue options in the story. None 
of the options you choose really make a difference in dialogue and are 
typically answered with vague responses that could easily answer either 
dialogue you chose. Instead of feeling like I'm connecting with the 
characters by choosing unique options to communicate with them, it all ends 
up being pre-determined and detracts from that personalization. You could 
remove the options and nothing about the story or interactions between 
characters would change. I love the Fate Series with all my being, and I 
love a lot of aspects of this game. There is alot of amazing artistic 
pieces in here as well as gameplay that manages to keep interest. These 
were some faults that I had with the game and hope can be improved upon.",positive

greediness. I've spent money on mobile games before, but if you're not 
willing to whale for this one, don't bother spending a single dollar. Pulls 
are expensive, 10-pulls don't even guarantee a 4* hero, and 5* heroes have 
a 1% drop rate. This is all because they put equipment in the same draw 
pool as the heroes, which is super frustrating. In my opinion, the game is 
worth playing for free, but not getting invested in. People spend literally 
hundreds of dollars to get one hero they want during their banner event, 
and still don't have any guarantee. Really kills motivation to play past

not alone on this. Look at YouTube and see for yourself the frustration and 
money spent just to get someone new. It's sad when you see a game with this 
sort of fan base and love get robbed because they want to make a few extra 
bucks. The money made, for sure doesn't go into content but these cash grab 
characters. Truly when content is based on characters in banners we are in 
trouble.",positive
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Even tho it steals my wallet, no game can compare to 
Fate/GO. I only rarely see any bugs around this game with is great. The 
only problem is, it consumes too much space. So, fix that Aniplex (PS: 
Finally, after years of waiting, it's available in the Philippines. Don't 
need APK anymore)",positive

"I have loved this game for as long as I can remember. Nice to see it 
released here now. You guys need to add on your page. If you have USB debug 
on, the game won't run. I do my own app development so I have it on and it 
took me months to figure out it was that causing it. Lost my game progress 
too.",positive
"Excellent story and characters and an elegant gameplay system let down only 
by a painful gatcha system. You may not need the 5* Servants to do well, 
but they are the most popular for a reason. Translation sometimes 
questionable but it has improved since the start",positive

servants",positive

"Good game, just hope players can have more interact to each others",positive
"A fun game that is insanely easy to sink a lot of time in, especially early 
on when you level up every couple of missions for easy AP, the gameplay is 
fun for a card based combat game, the story is amazing, and the sheer 
number of potential Servants, all with their own unique personalities based 
on their legacy, makes collecting them an adventure in itself, my only real 
complaint is how tedious and tiring it can be to raise your Servant's 
strength, as farming for Embers of Wisdom can derail progress elsewhere",positive

Love the game but it keeps kicking me of,positive
"I was excited to play, but it's pretty boring and slow and the story is 
long winded and pointless at the same time. Also, weird that your heroes 
don't level from fighting, you have to pump items into them.",positive
"Uninstalled this game because I can't play this game unless I keep 
""developer options"" turned off. I use usb tethering from phone to my laptop 
to share my phone's internet connection. This game constantly monitors to 
see if ""developer options"" is on and if it is, it tries to send an email to 
support (even when I'm not trying to play the game and sometimes even when 
I close the game, it will do the same thing) This just got too annoying and 
I had to uninstall. I really wish I could play this game, but I don't think 
it's reasonable for a game to tell me what I can do on my phone when I'm 
not playing the game.",positive
"Free to play if you never want to get anything useful. Boring gameplay 
that's been done a million times. If I could just get it as a VN then it 
would be worth it. The dev's must love the horny nerds throwing hundreds of 
dollars for a 5% or less chance at getting the card they dream of",positive

"I've always wanted to get into the Fate series, so I guess this is my 
gateway. It's highly addictive. Just don't let the gacha consume you!",neutral
"A great game for strategy focused players. It really mixes in a good card 
management system, bring me some nostalgia from kingdom of hearts. The 
story is also somewhat entertaining as expected from an anime based game. 
It's not quite the best game for people who aren't used to the whole 
gachapon system though, that aside it's a well made game to pass your time 
with. As for the servants try not to set your eyes on one servant cuz the 
gatchapon will burn your spirit if so, try to look for either a good 
servant as stated in some website (GameA) orgo and have fun with the 
servant that looks good to you. A tip though if your serious about the 
game, there is a reroll function in the game, try and get heracles 
(berserker) in your free spin he will be a huge asset for you in the game 
especially in earlier levels.",positive

interest a couple months ago and dropped it and just tried picking it up 
again to see if I'd find it more entertaining now, but it just isn't nearly 
as good as it can be. Quartz takes forever to get in game, and the rolls 
feel incredibly unbalanced (I have a friend who has gotten ever 5* to ever 
come out and another who only gets the same 3 characters on every roll and 
they roll the same amount of quartz). For those of us who get the same 
characters, the game just feels futile. There's no real reward. The UI is 
stupidly clunky to use (have to click the back button a million times to 
get to the world hub and see the news. They also have like given up with QA 
on the newer characters. mebd's posture makes her look broken and 
Iskander's head is always stuck behind the UI so I can't even see the 
character. The game is fun if you like the fate series, but for the rest of 
us it's boring and repetitive",negative

up a few characters. Some are easy to, while others are difficult. But 
still a great game all in all 8/10",positive

"The game is definitely for fans of fate franchise. The story and the game 
play are just great with lot of tactic. However people who aren't fan of 
fate series might not actually enjoy the game at all as the gacha rate is 
insultingly low, at %1 for an SSR character. So yeah, expect a lot of salt, 
mines of salt or even mountains of salt if you are new to fgo",positive
"Great game overall. The main stories and gameplay can be boring at the 
first few chapters but everything got better in later chapters, even event 
stories and the lore of each character is well-written. As mid-game, the 
game mechanics become more interesting and challenging. And the selling 
point of this game comparing to many other mobile games is the fact that 
every character can be useful. The gacha rate is definitely bad, but don't 
let those n00bs who gone ""bad game cant even got a golden servant in 
blahblahblah 10-pulls and everything is garbage"" got you (lol did those 
m0ngrels even try??), the main content of this game is absolutely clearable 
with lower rarity units and there is already several youtube channels 
showing bronze/silver clear. As some veteran players said, this game is not 
about getting who you like, it's all about loving who you got.",positive
"Fate/Grand Order is a great game. The controls are easy to understand. The 
graphics are fitting and are always getting small visual tweaks for the 
better every now and then. Gameplay is fun! The story is improving with 
each new chapter. Events happen frequently so players won't be bored when 
there isn't any story to complete. You can be completely f2p and/or play 
casually and still have a lot of fun with the game. It is definitely one of 
the best mobages out there!",positive

"The games characters are all unique and they all have deep lore and 
backgrounds, even the item cards have some flavor/lore text that give them 
another layer of uniqueness. The game continually updates with new events 
and characters and there is great satisfaction in leveling and upgrading 
characters to the max. The art on character and item cards are all also 
diverse, expertly drawn, and all have a unique design and lots of detail by 
the artists that make me want to look at them for hours. This is a paid 
game, it is still entirely possible to play for free but even dropping a 
few dollars for favorite characters has made this gaming experience 
worthwhile, I highly recommend this game.",positive
"The game itself is engaging, but the game client is poor - it won't 
recognize S-pen input unlike any other Android app, and even when you exit 
using the in-game option the client doesn't properly close. Tonight, with 
the servers being down for maintenance, this resulted in the app constantly 
crashing and trying to restart due to losing connection, even though it 
should have stopped running per Android policies to stop background apps 
from continuing to run. This caused my tablet to effectively lock up, as I 
couldn't force close the app due to it constantly bringing up the error log

Kinda wish drop rates were higher. But over all good app I recommend it.,positive
"The game is incredibly fun, I do have only a few misgivings about it, one I wish that the developers would separate the craft essences and servant pulls from the summoning place, they already have three or four sections for summoning like the regular summoning the special event summoning and the friend point summoning, they could at least take time to separate the craft essences and servants into different summoning categories so it's easier to summon servants, I know that the percentage to summon a four or five star servant is low and I don't mind that but with the craft essences and servants being summoned together makes it practically impossible to summon more then a three star servant (trust me that happens to me every time I try to summon) also I keep getting the same servant over and over again,so I wish that they would make it so you never get the same servant in the same summon, another thing that I would like to change is that they would add an auto battle option, just for when you are farming for exp cards in the daily ember gathering quests, just so the game automatically all chooses the best cards that your current team set up is on the quest you are currently on. But other then those the rest of the game is perfect.",positive

I can't even SUMMON a servant higher then sliver, chance up my arse. 5 star 
guarantees, only if it's a craft essence. I miss the old game.",positive

This is just another time killer type of game which is fun if you know of the show to understand the story behind the servants. I would have rated this a 5 star but the downside is I have spent real money and if I were to uninstall this game it doesn't save any of my data. So don't spend money on this game just grind if you really want the stronger characters.,negative
"This mobile game has a lot more features than a normal one, and the game follows its own storyline.  It even has a feature where you can rewatch the cutscenes again.  So the game does have many things to explore and check out.  There's still lots of improvement that needs and yet they also address those as well, so it's a game where they also improve for the better.",positive

"This game is meant only for whales. The game does not provide any 
reasonable way to accumulate gems (in-game currency) even in the beginning

ridiculous. ($25 dollars to ALMOST be able to do a ten servant summon)

spend so much. I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars between ffbe, 
dbz dokkan, and dynasty warriors unleashed and I have to say, this game 
gives you almost nothing to start. I barely have enough to ge5 by. The 
leveling system is a disgrace and the summoning is terrible. The rates are 
very low and the fact that your item and character summons are mixed makes 
a hard system even harder to deal with. The game.makes over a billion 
dollars a year and that enables it to give out close to nothing to help you 
along. It's really sad. I thought other games were bad.",negative
Fails to connect to servers 100% useless app,negative
"As with what everyone else is saying, the pull rates for your favorite characters are next to nothing as they are locked behind a 1%(less imo) pick up rate. You don't ""need"" nice 4-5 star pulls, but all the great characters we know and love are there. So what's th let's point of playing a Fate Gacha game if I will virtually never get them?   Visuals are nice, combat is entertaining for a bit, but if you take Fate from the name this game would plummet.",positive
It's takes a lot of memory back ends up worth it!! Best free game there is and LOVE THIS COMMUNITY!!!! Love you Nasu...,positive
Been a Fate fan for very long time. Unfortunately the only thing that's kept me from playing was the rng for summoning heroes. It's terrible and after spending a lot of money and not getting the heroes that I want I just stopped playing. Unfortunately not much is gonna be done to change the gacha system so if you wanna get into this game be prepared to spend a lot of money doing so.,negative

A great game for fate series fan,positive
"Game is fantastic gameplay wise and graphics are amazing, the problem is that the lag is really bad if you don't have an amazing phone. Like the game needs a serious optimization because it really is obnoxious. Another thing...they are VERY clingy to there in-game currency, after the campaign, you are gonna have an horrible time summoning new servents. And if that wasn't bad enough the drop rate for high level servents are DRASTICALLY LOW, so not only is it hard as hell to get the currency to summon servents, but you have to be incredibly lucky to get the good ones. Overall the game is amazing and very unique honestly, but with the lag and the impossible to get servants. I'm just gonna have to put this game on hold and come back to it.",positive
"Awesome story and gameplay. Totally free to play. Why? Because all characters, even the free ones, were designed to be useful. Huge bonus if you like Typemoon universe and Fate. Be warned, the size of the game might be too big for some. However, if you want a certain servant that's 4 star above, give up because you won't get it. The gacha rate is really horrible and expensive, you'll see a lot of people saying 3 stars below is perfectly doable, which is true, however, the most aesthetically pleasing characters are high rarity all the time.",positive
"Excellent game very fun, the story is interesting anyway a realky fun game, however some of the characters i think some of the servants stars doesn't fit their legend like siegfried a famous dragon slayer a strong character in the anime but in the game he's only a 4 star character so i think the stars for the characters should be revised or something",positive

"It's grindy Fate/GO what do you expect?  This isn't for people without self control, the game rewards ten shot puller and each and ever servant is valuable to you.  Mashu is a wonderful servant, keep her levelling fast.  The other thing is you don't need five stars to make a good team! There are a ton of good and healthy 1, 2, 3 and 4 stars that are good! (Heracles is OP) also concerning separating crafts essences, they should NOT BE separated due to how much saint quartz you get anyways and you'll be too limited.  I recommend saving up for servants you want (Also Waver and Merlin.) I have 435 quartz in Stock right now.  I hope everyone finds this useful  Sorry if I took up your space lol.

Just like the other guy said. It is very predatory. 1 saint quartz is a dollar lmao. You need 30 just to do a 10 draw. Rewards are very sparse and game is especially linear with no variation. You won't draw any of the characters that you like from the series. Graphics and gameplay are cool though,positive
My biggest complaint is how the character/equipment is all the same draw. So saving my rare saint crystals for a 10 card draw hoping for a good character I end up getting mostly equipment cards. It should be separated. If I want character cards that's all I should get. If I need some equipment there I go. Played this for a bit. Got my 4 star in the tutorial and after many many crystals later still the same! Will spend my time on something that I actually have a chance on,positive

The only downside is the gacha system. 1% chance to pull a 5 star, and the only guaranteed 5 star banners are paid only but happen twice a year.

My second gripe is the summoning, as I said earlier you have to spend an extrodiante amount of time to get a single piece of saints quarts, to be fair the game has a system where you spend 30 and get a guaranteed 4 star or up, but the problem is, craft essences are put in that 4+ pool taking up a large majority of the chance, meaning you wasted enough time to get 30 quarts and still get absolutely nothing good. Or you can pay to win with a full 10 summon for about $24 and still literally get nothing. As the game stands, it has potential but it is not well thought out on the playing experience.",negative

Terrible story and character designs. The writing for the story and dialogue is horrible. The action would make up for some of this if it wasnt so repetitive. I dont know why this is considered an rpg since your selections mean nothing and everything plays out the same way. This is a far departure from what the Fate series started out as. Another one of my favorite franchises turned to trash.,negative
"You know it's you guys at Delightworks are putting a stain on the Fate franchise. You guys don't even want to respond to people who are having issues with the game. It just shows that you guys really don't care about the Type-Moon fan base. You guys really don't deserve any money you have made. People have given you money hoping they could get the servant they want. Some of them have played this game for a bit over a year and still haven't gotten the servents they wanted. They gave you money only for you to take it and kick dirt in their face and walk away. I pray that you and companies like you all go bankrupt. You don't deserve any money you have. If Fate wasn't in the title, you guys wouldn't have anywhere near as much money as you do now and you know it.",positive

"i will make this short(but maybe long)...overall,this game itself is pretty bored..what make it hyped/overrated is because  1- anime character and animeish graphic 2- infamous drop rate/gatcha 3- a game from famous franchise from famous company..  seriously, give it a thought...if this game has different title with different characters,would people will spend time and money? I mean.. 1- gameplay is f****ing bored..seriously 2- the character..i mean,i dont know which is which anymore..too much people that have nothing to do with heroicism, unnecessary and genderbend.. omg..the genderbend..fate series use to be special..but know they just throw anything historical associated..maybe we can see assassin bin laden after this.. 3- the story is fine i guess..but only the main one... otherwise mostly weird and unnecessary.. 4- not rewarding..a game is about spend time to get reward,not spend time and money and not get anything..  and there,boom...i going to delete this game although i have ssr...bcoz hell yeah...",negative
Please increase the drop rates for 5 star servants the fact that you made them so low makes it impossible for players that can't spend money on the game to get them I only have one and that was from the tutorial,negative

"Game drop rate of good characters are trash, freezes to much, prices are high and unreasonable and you can farm for weeks and months and still don't get a descent team of 4 or 5 stars. Not worth it, its only good because of the anime and character, that's probably why it has 4.4 rating.",positive

"Its a fun game. but, its only you. No way to communicate with other people. Summons rates are garbage, you mostly get craft essence, and it takes a TON to summon. the stuff to summon with are expensive and not worth spending real money on. Good to pass time though.",positive

Best Game in Market,positive
"I haven't had the chance to actually play this game. I have the app in a folder on my home screen of apps I'm eventually gonna try out, but even though I've opened this app only once for a few minutes, here's what happens. For the past several weeks something has been closing whatever app I'm currently in, forcing me to abruptly end what I'm doing, and then telling me to choose an app to open something else. With no instructions and not knowing what to do, I choose Gmail. What I then see is a completely filled out error report from this app telling me to ""contact us via email"" as it turns out. I've sent this email several times with no response and no fix. I haven't had the chance to even play this game and it's already the most insufferable app on the market. From both a user's perspective and a programmer's, this is the worst way to handle an error. The fact that there's even an error at all while I'm not even running the app is ludicrous. Congratulations, you've lost a potential player. This is fortunate for me because I've been trying to decide on apps I could delete to free up space. That's one more down.",negative
Cannot recommend as long as the game requires you to keep your device in 100% pristine condition software-wise. The 3rd party firmwares I installed I did so because I was plugging security holes on my device.,positive

Peraonally, I don't want to throw away my stones on only crafting essense filled summons. There should be some that also lets you link or save your progress so if you have to delete the app for what ever reason you don't have to constantly start over each time.",positive

"Gameplay is fun, alright main story, and hilarious events happen throughout the year.  Characters have tons of personality, as is expected from a Fate game.  Unfortunately, a high amount of playtime is required to do anything, microtransactions are overpriced, and the rarity distribution is skewed.  About half of servants are SR or SSR, during rate-up this means you will have a ~2% and .7% chance of getting what you want respectively.  People have spent over a grand on this game and still fail to get what they want.  Also features a plethora of daily and weekly chores to do.  Great potential squandered.",positive

I'm reviewing this to give it a more unbiased judgment one thing you need to know that's very important is what is good against what. Lancers archers and Sabres. You understand the triangle combat system it's pretty easy after that. Another thing you really want to do even when you're just starting out is the dailies take note of the level next to the Daily. Another thing always use support character. Preferably a strong one. If you want to level that is if you like the challenge use one closer to your level. The one thing this game has that your probably not going to like is that your going to have to study weaknesses and strengths a lot kind of lame I know but you're just going to have to get used to it.,positive

"It's ok, gatcha rolls are trash overall. But the heroes are cool once you have them. But they're hard to rank up. It has the most complicated and confusing mechanics for managing inventory, I hate that. Fire emblem was easier to get into while this feels like I lose my playpoints too quick. The campaign and free saints quartz are so little compared to all the events we need to wait for. The events are too quick and even change who you get on a daily basis, that's annoying. Just stay the same throughout the event don't wait for me to spend my quartz to change the gatcha the exact day after within the SAME event.",positive
"Will not load past 6%,so much for this game",neutral
It's really fun game and I have fun whenever I play it.,positive
"I loved the. I love the franchise, the characters,etc. I love this game and it's engaging story.  I hate the 1% gacha hell.  If they split raft essences and servants into two separate banners it'd be better, as craft essences are vital and add fun. But it's hard to love the game if you can't get your favorite servants.  It'll never happen, so take it for what it is: fun as hell once you get it down.",positive
Too bad its rigged. You wont get anything good from free quartz lol.,negative
"Art looks okay, and gameplay looks interesting but what killed me is the rate of 5 star. I don't care if you don't need it to beat the game, if you make something that super unobtainable..the game loses it's luster. I'ma go back to feh.",negative

"First freemium game I decided to throw down money on. Worth it, great game.",positive
"The graphic design for the game is great, as is the story thus far.  Where the game falters is the levelling system.  Battles mean nothing to levelling your characters.  Instead, you have to hope to receive specific items to grant xp to your individual party members.  Once you max your xp, you can ascend a character to gain access to more levels, but you need sets of random items that only drop from specific enemies, which also randomly generate in each battle.  For instance, two of my characters are sitting at their maximum level before ascending, and have been at that level for two weeks or more because both need four of an item which only drops in a daily quest on Thursday.  I've managed to get two total of that item thus far.  If there was some other way of getting these items, then the game wouldn't be half as frustrating.  When you add in the rarity of characters of different classes, it just compounds the frustration.  I'm sitting on over a hundred Saber xp cards because I still don't have a character to use them on.  Saint Quartz, the currency to purchase random draws for characters and craft essence cards, has only a finite source to get in game, and takes three Quartz to draw one single random item.  Otherwise it costs $23.99 to get a minimum amount to purchase the thirty needed to get a ten pack of draws that guarantee a four star ranked item.  These cards pull from the same limited list as the free daily summons, so it is very likely that you can get a ten pack with nothing but the items from the free daily, despite the cost of the paid pack.  Your enjoyment of the gameplay will depend entirely on your luck with random drops and draws, and the battles serve virtually no purpose other than to waste time and resources.",positive

RNG either doesn't work or is designed to be against the player since it takes lots of summonings to get characters you desire, if it was luck then that would be a different story... Unnecessary items are placed in both ""gacha"" type of elements to the game, my advice: divide and don't repeat, if you have certain ""cards"" (essences or servants) available for discovery in one ""gacha"" system, don't put any of those in the other... it's a rocky mistake that a game such as this I would've never expected to make.",positive

Just crashes everytime the tutorial pops up on my galaxy 3 pro.

I like the game but it returns me back when I get to play it,positive
"Overall a good game. The gameplay is simple and easy to get into while still being fairly unique with depth to it, particularly when you get to the more difficult content. As of now, all of the content can be cleared by lower rarity units (i.e. completely free) provided you put some thoughts into your strategy. That being said, the chances off getting a high rarity unit is quite low. The story is lacking compared to other series in the Fate franchise, but is decent for this type of mobile game. The events happen often enough to keep the game interesting, but not so often that it becomes stressful to grind. However, while the events are great, there isn't much to do in between the events after you clear the main story quests/free quests. Furthermore, while being able to borrow your friend's servants is nice, there isn't much you can do beyond that with other players, which is somewhat disappointing.",positive
"As a fan of the show, I like it.",positive
Dope xD,positive

"The good: Looks great, the plot is passable and occasionally entertaining, the variety of servants and the many scenes they each are allowed is great for fans. The bad: The load times are horrible, the servant summons are high cost with extremely limited free points, summon rates are awful for 3*+ servants and if you get a 5* it's likely just another craft item you'll just feed to another item, leveling requires grinding a specific enemy or paying for it, evolving requires grinding against super low drop rates, every battle except bosses is extremely monotonous which makes the grinding even worse. For diehard Fate/ fans this is probably worth while if you just want to see new servants, but after playing a few months the dull and grind heavy gameplay for little reward killed it for me. It's also hard to recommend this to new players since much of the evolving items with otherwise low drop rates are gained en masse through events that have already passed and make starting anew slower. The updates try to keep with the original Japanese release schedule so those short summon events get their time, but unless you're throwing a lot of money you'll only get to do a couple of summons per month after catching up on story anyways. Tl;dr: If you can handle grinding with servants you probably don't care about after long loading screens play it. If you like lore just look at the wiki since this version will always be years behind the Japanese one.",positive
Love the game but it won't let me in the game anymore hoping you guys could do something about it when it was just working fine yesterday,positive
"The game has a good story and the combat system is very unique. Even events are unique to as they give yiu a guaranteed 4 star servant if you work hard enough. Both standout to make this game one of the best mobile games anime fans can find.  But as for its shortcomings that's where it ruins it for anybody that has terrible luck. The summoning system is quite broken as in if you spend over 200$ to try to get a 5 or 4 star servant, your chances are slim to none and can be quite frustrating. And at most times when you pull a 4 or 5 star, it's a craft essence and not a servant.",negative
I didnt think there was a game that had worse roll rates than final fantasy brave exvius until i played this game. This game isnt so f2p friendly either so dont bother playing unleds you got $$$ to dump on this game  ******Edit******* Just wanted to update my review n let u guys kno this game is still trash. Dont bother playing it,negative
App shuts down like each round,positive
"Cannot even open this game. It gives me a long error about playing environment, Then proceeds to force close itself.",negative
"Just another rpg with extremely crappy rates don't let the fate ip fool you, f2p here and I had 153 saint quarts and 5 summon tickets ( summoning currency) and got nothing but 3 star servents after 5 10x pulls and the five tickets another thing that will annoy you are these craft essence pulls (which need good servents to be utilized to it's best potintial) have higher rates than the servents so enjoy getting 5 star essence (which again will eventually need 5 star servents because the Stat boost for 3 or 4 stars won't be enough for them) but only 3 star servents after the free 10x after the tutorial which gives you a four star just to butter you up.",positive
Reason I gave liw rating is because it won't let me play it wants to open with a email or a messenger never heard of such thing before until it's fixed I won't be playing,negative
"This game... Where to start? So the Fate series is easily one of my favorite anime series. And this game starts out promising, but it becomes apparent later on that this is just a game to milk Fate fans. The premium currency is expensive and the way to earn free premium currency is slow and runs out when you hit the end game. I loved the game at first, but it quickly turned sour as I continued to play the game. The game had major optimization issues at launch and it took them a long time to fix the problems. The game looks good except for some wonky animations. The story is okay at best due to the fact that it is filled with tons of filler content and it just never really goes anywhere. What should be a love letter to Fate fans is just a platform to milk them. And now we get into drop rates... Dear lord they are some of the worst rates I have seen in ANY mobile game. 1% rates for some of the best characters in the game and the events will actively try to screw you over by having items to make your character better go away with the event, so if you didn't sit there and grind for hours you are outta luck. Plus event summon characters can have less than 1% drops as well. So be prepared to get screwed over in that regard. And then there is the fact that I lost my account and multiple tries to reach out to the English devs have been met with... Silence. So this game can go rot for all I care. Spent money on this game to only lose my account. Thanks devs.",positive
"This game definitely appeals to the majority of players who are quite familiar with the Fate series in general. It also is a real treat for those who are unfamiliar with the series due to the game's story and mechanics. All in all, it's brilliant!",positive

"This is a fantastic sequel to Pok√©mon:GO. I lost faith in the CS:GO series when I saw how underwhelming PoGO was with its gameplay and new features. However, once I heard that they were overhauling everything in their new sequel, I decided to try it again. Despite removing AR, I enjoyed that they added new Pok√©mon based on mythology. This made the series become fresh although I object the method of obtaining new Pok√©mon. Also they revamped the combat system to become more enjoyable albeit more convoluted and they finally added a useful friend feature. This sequel made me feel alive again and I cannot wait for the next game in the series.",positive

"FGO is a mediocre game at best. The combat system is not bad. The level design is terrible. You do the same thing over and over. It's only at the boss stage where it changes. The story is forgettable. The gacha is the worse part of the game. 1% to get a 5 star is way too low. Not to mention that certain servants only available for a low period of time, and they won't come back for a while. FGO should've done what FEH did by including pity rates. The game is very , and I mean very grind heavy. It really makes it even more boring and tedious. The UI is straight forward. No complications. The character designs are fantastic. The sprites are pretty good also. They will also update them. Thumbs up for that. Overall, I can only really recommend FGO for the hardcore fate fans. I'd give it a 2.5/5.",positive

The game itself is OK but... Gacha rates for summons are ridiculous. There's no multiplier ever to boost rates and you'll always have that 1% chance at getting a 5 star. This also includes limited time units which is even more ridiculous to have a rate so low with no multiplier. I understand the money grab aspect of all gacha games but to go through a game not having the hero you really want makes for a less enjoyable gaming experience.,negative

However, I believe a ""Auto Mode"" would perhaps solve this issue greatly.

"Overall the gameplay, graphics, controls and story are good. You might ask then why such a low rating? The answer is simply tjat the people who run the game are ridiculously money hungry. Even for a mobile game these people have basically put themselves on par with EA.  The premium currency is ""saint quartz"" which you can earn in game with a catch. It differentiates between paid and free saint quartz and certain events only allow for paid.  It costs 3 quartz for a summon or 30 for a 10 summon which guarantees a 4 star but that is more likely to be a craft essence than a servant.  Just for reference they sell 1 quartz for a dollar, 4+1bonus for $3.99, 12+4bonus for $11.99, 25+11bonus for $23.99, 42+23bonus for $39.99 and 86+54bonus for $79.99.  Now these prices are higb and the tock package gives you almost 5 10x summons. These summons, however, still end up with a 4% chance of a 5 star craft essence and a very low 1% 5 star servant summon. The quartz is slow to come in via the normal game and the events are quite honestly stingy. (The latest is 5 days of events with 5 quartz per day for login so not even enough for a 10x summon)  Basically the publisher/developer has a high price, low drop rates and hard to generate quartz for free. This makes for bad marketing and gameplay. If the quartz is expensive and hard to get alot of free then increase drop rates. If not droo rates increase free gains of quartz and lower the prices of quartz by at least about 50%. (Lower prices mean more sales to make up for lost profit)  All in all since you ha e to engage with this system to get decent servants is why I gave my lengthy review and my low score.",positive

Finally! Whatever they did to fix that frozen black screen worked! I'm able to play it now! I been playing for a couple of weeks. I'm worried about what will happen when I complete all of the singularity's. What can I do to grind for Saint Quartz's? Unless they have special missions after I complete the singularity's/free missions?,positive

A really fun game in my opinion. I just wish the chances of getting a 5-star was higher.,positive
I'm sure this game is great if it would actually work. For whatever reason it refuses to load on a stock Galaxy S7 claiming that its not supported. On top of that i also cant get it to connect to the server on a Galaxy Tab A running strictly on wifi.,positive

I usually stop playing games like this after a week but the story is so interesting I mostly just keep playing because of it . The grinding for resources can get long but it's not bad and the battle system is easy to use.,positive
It's an alright game. The battle system could be more interactive. I'm thinking more like a summoner war battle system. The leveling of the spirits is messed up too. They should get experience after each battle not just when u enhance them.,negative
Cool but u should try to make it easier to level up,positive
"Honesty, the game is alright. The story and plot are pretty well written, especially considering that it's a mobile game. The gameplay is certainly no Fire Emblem or Blazblue or Brave Frontier or Grandblue Fantasy , but it's not bad,  per say, just gets repetitive after a while. Has more depth than most other mobile games.  Story is given more effort as well.",positive
I would love to see some crossovers or more events.,positive
The game is great but the summoning isn't  good the chance at getting 4 or 5 stars are to low for my liking farming takes forever but over all its a great game,positive
"Screenshot your Master's information! Including Transfer code, etc. And ur Main Party members!! Very important incase u switch phones or reinstall the app! It does not allow u to access ur account via log in. If u lose the app u lose all your progress if u do not lrovide this above information exactly correct to the support desk. Very frustrating. As great as the game is, this lead me to a 2 star review because now I have to start all over, after a decent amount lf grinding ingame I did.",positive
too expensive to get heroes and to make matters worse the leveling system is beyond stupid,negative

I like it well enough but it's slow on animations and servant intros,positive
The game is for those who are invested in the Fate Series and will take the time to do some soul searching when they spend money and don't get the servants they want. It's a great game and looking forward to it's advancements to JP version.,positive

Deleted the app by accident and re  downloaded it and it didn't save any of my data or progress I worked had for,negative
Game is great but the amount of essences you pull instead of units is frustrating seems like you need to spend alot of money to even get decent units let alone a 5 star increased drop rates don't seem to increase anything of those unit drop rates,negative
Super addictive and can't wait for more servants from all the stories and sagas of the fate titles.,positive
Good game for Fate fans but not a very good f2p game. Caters to pay to play players more than f2p players.,neutral

Its a relly good game yhe story is good and i like its characters,positive
"Just downloaded the game a few days ago, but I'm already unsure about it. I know it's a newer game, and hopefully they're still adding to it, but so far it's a little boring and repetitive. I'm a fan of the anime, so seeing the characters and the art is fun. However, the jerky battle camera that is constantly twitching around as you attach gives me a headache, the endless dialogue and cutscenes are very boring and end up getting skipped and the fact that once you bring up your attack card choices you can't go back to the last screen to activate abilities you forgot is dumb. Overall it feels like a poorly-made flash game that needs a lot of work, but it DOES have potential if they can add more content and focus more on the experience/gameplay and less on the heady story.",negative
The game is so fun to play,positive
"Polished graphics and loaded with events. Consistently updated. Overall, I'm enjoying the game. However, the gacha has very low rates of getting the 5 star characters.",positive
This game is Amazing And its even better if you've seen the Anime,positive
You need to update this game because it's not working. It almost crashed my phone by just showing me a white screen and also it keeps sending me to an error message. Please have an update for this game so it can work on all devices.,negative
Really like playing the game.,positive
"I love your game in general. It has all the things I was looking for in a mobile game. But after sometime in game I could be doing a story segment, or before a battle, during it or after I get booted from the app. Please fix that please because its a great app and ill give 5 stars afterwards when fixed.",positive
One of the best games I ever played,positive
"You should put in a back button option for when you hit attack, because I forget all the time to use my card skill and sometimes it's a killer haha just that option would be nice I think",negative
This game it's one of my favorite so far as a fan of the fate series,positive
This is a good game for fate fan,positive
"It's a good looking and fun game, but disappoint that even if you spend more than 80 dollars you don't get nothing good, and less the good servants, you need to spend much more or have the devil's lucky",positive
Its very well made my only f word problem is that I have an older account I forgot my transfer number and I have no backup so basically I have to start a new please let us use Google play I'm begging you,positive

Very fun and addicting game! Definately the best mobile game app out there!,positive
"Everything is fine except for the bs summon system, very unforgiving and readily inaccessible. Done the draws so many times, but time and time again, nothing decent. Also, absolute bottom of the barrel drop rates, good luck trying to get far with these terrible drops. If it wasn't for these annoying problems, this would be a solid mobile game, but as typical gacha system bullsh*t, which this one being worse than others, greatly hampers the overall experience.",negative
I can't play it. It says I can install it but it won't work in my environment? Edit: I still can't play for some stupid reason. Please fix this.,negative
Decent gacha game but the rate of getting the much needed 5 star characters is a measly 1%. They're generous with the premium currency but not enough to offset the possibilities of getting 5 star characters.,positive

"I adore the fate series, it's my favorite anime series, as well as having some really fun video games like fate/extra, and fate/extella. But this game feels like a mess, the fighting is good, coherent and easy to string strong combos, but the story is worse then the movie it's based off of. I don't know if it's because it's to slow, or to cut up, but I don't like the way it's presented. Don't get me started on summoning, it's a joke, it makes dokkan battle look good. Summon rates are laughable, along with not knowing if you got a servant or mage essence, it feels cheap, the summon animation also feels that way. So for people like me, who are more collectors, then players, give it a pass.",positive
I luv the anime but this took it to a whole new level!,neutral

"LOVE THE FATE SERIES!

I got my Hubby Archer Emiya so I'm good lol üòç   **I have an Archer X Reader Fan-fic called Fate/Reckoning on Wattpad if anyone is interested (shameless advertising).**    The game would have gotten 5 stars if it were a tad more reasonable with fan-fave character recruitment. I get it though, gotta make that $$$ and all. üòì But honestly my hopes and dreams can only be shattered so many times by a phone game.

"The game play held a suprising amount of depth compaired to its competitors, yet is simple enough to get into. There are some balancing questions id have for the devs but the benefit to this game is that its entirely possible to be pure f2p.  For a free game it gets a ton of updates and a consistent stream of new content, almost too much at a time to be honest. If youre a fan of the franchise and are looking to try it out, i would highly recommend it.",positive
"Having lots of fun with this game, probably accentuated by my being a big Type-Moon fan. If I had to list a downside, it'd be the Gacha rates - it isn't unusual to save up for months for a specific event summon and then not get what you were aiming for :') But it's still an awesome game and the only mobile game I play nowadays. &lt;3",positive

Not much content - I completed the main storyline in about 3 days. Honestly, this launched in the West only a month ago, so I don't expect much yet. 3.

"A good game with addictive gameplay, beautifully voiced characters, music.

Very long stamina recover time, 5 mins for 1 while u will need 10 for easiest stage and 40 for the hardest -3. Being milk for cash, 1$ for 1 quartz, 3 quartz for each pull, each week u can get 2 free quartzs if finish weekly quests -4. There is no Google/Facebook connect so u can only play on 1 device and each time u change it, u will need to use in-game transfer to continue playing. In short, only play this game if u have lots of free time, rich or use 1 device for long time.",positive

"I loved playing this game. However,  one day I had to uninstall it to save space on my phone. Anyway, after I had enough space to download it again, the game would not allow me to play. It would go through the downloading screen and everything, but the ""Touch Screen"" part would be as far as I could go. When I touch my screen to start the app, it goes black. I can hear the music but the screen remains black, and after a while, it says ""Stopped Responding"". I can no longer play FGO. I also tried playing on my tablet, but I had the same issue despite never having installed it there before. Note: Both of my devices are android, and I have noticed that many others on android devices have the same issue.",neutral
"Waited a long time was definitely worth the wait!  Edit: singularity six, okeanos is extremely ram heavy as it turns out and so you may have to, on older or cheaper devices, tweak what programs you allow to run in the back ground while playing if that fails to free up enough ram for you ""like it did me here"" you can lower the amount of ram the game demands by adjusting your team comp I dropped scathach and one other servant and was able to play out the rest of okeanos no problem. Remember that this game over all is ram heavy at a minimum requirement of 1.1 gigs before investing money in it.

Everything about this game is amazing. The story is good and hilarious. The cimmand spell mechanic is interesting.

I have mixed feelings with this game. For one thing the gatcha system is so soul breaking and demanding on real money its infuriating. On the other hand looks great and plays well. But dont expect to get the character you want even if you pay for quartz chances are you will not get them.,positive

"The game itself is fun and easy to play. The real issue is that it is  pay to win level maximum. St quartz are everything in this game and while they do give some out each week if you don't pay money you will progress at a snails pace.    You might get 1-4 saints quartz a week for free, maybe. You can get them from doing the campaign (there is only so many quartz you can get from the campaign) but with the limited AP you end up having to bounce between the campaign, events, and daily quests. You will probably miss out on many events.   Things saints quartz do: *Resurrect everyone at full hp and noble phantasam  *refill your ap (all quests and missions cost ap to do. Ap comes back at 1 point every 5 minutes and many quests cost between 20-30 AP to do, without AP you can't do anything)  *roll for more servants and gear. In order to get more stuff you spend saints quartz or summoning tickets but tickets are not that common. 1 ticket or 3 saints quartz =1 roll.   30 saints quartz = 10 rolls (you can't use summoning tickets for the 10 roll only quartz) but with a guaranteed 4 star or better and some other benefits. In short doing the 30 quartz 10 roll gives dramatically better chances at getting something decent and with a 1% drop rate for 5 star  stuff....that increased chance is really important.  I short the game is fun but the pay to win is really dumb.  UPDATE: spent over 590 saints quartz during an event to get a servant that supposedly had an increased drop rate. That's several hundred rolls. In all of that I did not get it, I only got one random 5 star servant.  DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GAME! Drop rate is beyond terrible.  I made the mistake of putting in money and will not be doing so again. I recommend anyone thinking of playing this game does not either",positive
I like this game but im giving up on it because it seems to time out every time I try to log in or even restart the app so I'm on hiatus til this app fixes it errors,positive
"Amazing game. Been a fan of the fate series for years and always hoped this game would get a NA version. Graphics are great, gameplay is fun and more interesting than a lot of gacha games. Summon rates are admittedly pretty low but unlike other gachas even the lower rarity servants can be very good. Love the game and will continue to play for a long time to come.",positive
The game keeps crashing when I try to complete a mission on the island of wyverns in the third singularity.,neutral
"The game looks good and is overall pretty engaging with team building and combat strategy, especially if you like all of the Fate series.   However, the summoning system is really holding the game back for me. It seems it either gives you everything you want, or is soul crushingly cruel, and I personally landed on soul crushing.   I think it isn't a good sign when the recommendation online is to make new accounts until the starter currency rolls what you want (wish i knew that when starting). I'd consider spending money, but the summons are 100% up to chance, so the odds of spending $40 and getting nothing in return is just too high. It would be much better if you could just buy something and not pay for a 'chance' (1%) at something. Unfortunately, games like this are really counting on the whales to pay whatever it takes to get what they want.  Ultimately the game is playable with fodder/free units, but the way the game uses 'friends' and events to display new characters just feels bad, and seems to be capitalizing on that feeling to pressure you into paying, especially with the number of limited time characters. Considering the amount of money these pseudo gambling games make, I'm not expecting a change any time soon.  My advice: there is a lot of cool stuff here, but leave any expectations of getting premium units at the door. If you get one, count your lucky stars. The less you expect from summoning, the less disappointed you will be and the less it will hurt. You may find it easier to just buy an account with good units pre-rolled.",positive
This game used to work for me but now it doesn't. I get pass the download and it stops responding,negative
Great story and gameplay.,positive
I love fate but this game really wants your money. Pls increase your drop other games at least gives you a decent chance to pull a 5* hero but 1% for you guys is down right disheartening does not matter how much you save your odds are so low you might as well not pull at all. If you want to play this game pls listen that you might be stuck with sub par servants unless your uber lucky or spend cash.,positive
"For some reason when I try to start it up, it keeps giving me a black screen and then crashes. Idk why.",positive
Grinding takes a while and I'm not about to pay $40 for a single 5 star guaranteed summon that's a horrible deal,negative
"I find fgo to be a good game. I enjoy the servants and there extra stories,  the monthly events, and how much you can see went into the game.  How ever it's far from perfect. If you have a weak phone it's unplayable. I have a gallery 3 mini and it crashes when i do some gotchas, and play for more then 15 minutes.   If you have anything weaker then this, then I'm sorry to tell you this, but you can not play it. Plus the the gotcha is very unforgiving.  I wish the game will do what gbf dose and make it where you can only buy any one character you want by spending around 50 dollars each new month if you wish. Or pick one 5 star you want out of 3 like some other games will do.  And really these negatives could take out the fun for the game for some people. Not only that but this game dose feel like a very high stakes gambling game. So be careful when spending your money.  I don't care if your wife or husband servant came out. Because there is a huge possibility you might not get them after spending over 300$.  Don't get me wrong. I love the game, but know that these are some problems to a fun game. So please be careful while playing it.",positive

"It's an ok game, I wouldn't recommend it to those who aren't a fan of the series. As far as story and gameplay/combat mechanics goes, it's very deep and well thought out. Ultimately the game is a visual novel with dungeon rpg elements. Graphics are ok but the illustrations for each servant card are pretty amazing. The game doesn't really give new players any incentive to continue playing, so if you didn't start playing at launch then you're gonna be using a support servant for quite a long time to help carry you through everything until you can get yourself a decent team of servants (rerolling for a 5* servant is a pain but worth it). Also it's a gacha game. I play one other gacha game seriously (Final Fantasy Record Keeper) and recently started another one and by far this one is thee most unforgiving, extremely low rates on 5* servants and the currency you use to summon is very difficult to come by which is why I said earlier the game doesn't give new players any incentives to continue playing. Though long term, there are login reward bonuses so you can horde the currency and summon tickets the other option is to spend real money, though I warn you the risk is high and the reward is very very low. Lastly it's fairly addicting, there is a grind for materials to level up and ascend servants which could get stale sometimes but the motivation really comes from just wanting to get that last card art for each servant.   TL;DR: Recommended for veteran or die hard Fate fans only. Though if you're a veteran or die hard, you're probably playing this already. Honestly it almost feels like the game creators went out of their way to make the game less appealing to people who are generally new to the series. GLHF.",positive

"The combat system is not my cup of tea to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of this 1x -2x - 3x matching thing or whatever you wanna call it, an going by what games I play they were  more of a swipe or tap for attacks Which is quite enjoyable.  Example of a game which has a pleasing combat system would be Brave Frontier with a characters regular attack being a tap or swiping up, left and right for different abilities.   Overall the game is enjoyable if you love the fate series or just want a game to past the time.",positive

"This game benefits from having no player versus player, since there is no pressure to buy your way to victory.   Silver and bronze servants are not only easy to get, but also as good as or better than gold servants for clearing story missions and doing daily and event missions.   Still want a gold servant? Almost every event includes one free gold servant, with the opportunity to get four more copies of the same. Weekly missions, logging in daily, and trading mana prisms each month will also get you the Saint Quartz and gacha tickets for summoning. So it's only a matter of time and patience, if you don't or can't spend money.   I highly recommend checking a guide or Reddit on the game before diving in.   Finally, remember that this is not pay to win; it's pay to waifu. The other angry reviews that you see of people criticizing the gacha system usually focus on the latest shiny servant and craft essences that they really WANTED, but didn't NEED.  Stay humble, get to know your bronze and silver heroes and heroines, and stick around for the gold servant give-aways. You'll have way more fun that way.",positive
"For those who are stuck in the back screen after start, try turn off download from unknown sources. Worked like a charm for me after trying literally everything else.",positive

This a well design game with a lot of dedication and love put into it. The graphics and controls are fantastic but the only flaw of the game is that it requires a lot of grinding to start up. It is also unfortunate that your choices during the story don't affect the conclusion of the game. In the end you are only reading a pre-written story that unfolds in front of you while you collect powerful servants and build interesting teams.,positive

Good game with somewhat okay story. Definetly something for fate fans to enjoy. Only downside is the tediousness require to get 5 star units. And the price to get these items to draw is quite expensive. Not recomended for f2p users.,positive
Tried it out since a friend recommended the game full farmed the nobunaga event or whatever as well as clearing a bunch of the story. However the game is way too cash grabby and has too many flaws so probably going to stop playing it and stick to other games,positive

Been gaming with FGO since Japan version started. Never stopped since.,positive
So much fun as long as you don't lose your mind.,positive
Fans of the series love it. This is actually my first entry to the Fate series and I still enjoy it greatly as an Android game. Not for the micro-transaction faint of heart though.,positive
Wouldn't run on my Galaxy S8. Sent email to the dev team. Will revise if they come back with anything useful..,positive
"I know it's a gacha but I can't help but wish for higher rates.... Aside from that, as a fate fan, it's really good and pretty f2p friendly. Would recommend to any fate fan.",positive
"Thoroughly enjoy this game, as a fan of the Fate Franchise. Has become very addicting^^",positive
I really enjoy this game,positive
Crashes litterally every 10 minutes... cant even do story without it crashing,neutral
Awesome Game Love It !,positive
"Great game, amazing story line.  I would have given full five stars. But take heed of the comments people, getting 5 star servants is near impossible in this game, 4 stars are a little easier due to events.  Summon rates are just god awful can spend alot of quartz and not get a 5 star barely a 4 star if super lucky.  Please do not waste your money here. Also its dumb to mix craft essence with servants for summons, makes the chances even harder.  Overall good game though with great graphics.",positive
Cany even play...,positive
This game isn't letting me transfer data over from my old device to my new one. I re made a transfer number and password and tried probably ten times but nothing,neutral
I love this game but it keeps logging me out its really annoying at this point plz fix,negative
"Just amazing, no complaints",positive
This game is super cool and easy to play and the most part what I love is the characters show their stories what happen to them in real life. I love this gameüíñüå∑üëëüíé,positive
Was really good game would have given five stars if it wouldn't kick me off for three days every time there's an update,positive
"this game is one of the most frustrating yet makes you feel the most accomplished. It has a great, compelling storyline and can be cleared with any servant. The gacha is mainly to get your favorite waifu and its really hard to with only a 1% chance to get a 5* character. When you do pull it, the feeling of accomplishment is much better than most games. Give it a try",positive
"Refuses to run on rooted phones. It doesn't crash, just closes and opens up an email to support, who will also refuse to help you. I think PayPal might be triggering on the ""send email"" action which is a PayPal issue instead.  Anyway, it looks like I spent about a half hour just to find out I'm simply not allowed to run this game for some reason.",positive
Great game. Don't have to spend a dime to keep up with other players because there is no PvP.  Rate up is a lie though. Don't believe their lies.,positive
Love it. Crazy about it.,positive
Great game. Addicting and very enjoyable. Recommend it.,positive

Installed the game and it is forcing open PayPal and trying to make me send them money.,neutral
"Not to bad but items you need to rank up are few and few between, some are not even there except in events but regular ones are rare drop at a very low rate",negative
"Well this game wouldn't run on my galaxy note 8. Every time I would open the app, it would force PayPal open and wanted me to send money to Fates support email. I scoured online to see if anyone else had this issue but didn't see anything at all. Guess this just won't be for me.",positive
Great game it's very fun and love the whole cast of characters coming in soon,positive
I just love it. A mobile game based on my favorite Anime is something I love.,positive
OKITA MY WAIFU WHY WONT YOU COME TO ME!!!,neutral
"The story and gameplay is certainly great, but beware of the addiction this game presents. To put it simply, be wise with your money.",positive
"Fun game and there is some strategy behind it. Too bad the gacha rates for 5 star servants is beyond ridiculous. That being said, game is playable with a solid team of 3 stars.",negative
"Fun game, but you'll have to be really lucky to land those rare summons.",positive
"Repetitive gameplay and expensive. Everytime I put money into it, it was never worth it. The Gacha rates are just BAD.   I would uninstall if I wasn't obsessed with the FATE series.   The events actually have decent rewards, but otherwise, most of the gameplay is very unrewarding and it takes many slow battles to get anywhere.   As far as story, I'd call it cute and funny. Not very captivating like what i'd expect from FATE.   If the game was just a bit more rewarding, it would be worthwhile. Good time killer. It'd be nice if I could skip the battle animations.",positive
I love this game but i believe in my personal opinion that a multiplayer pvp will be a great addition to this game so people can have friendly matches to see who is the best,positive
Love it but I got a new phone and my data isn't transferring is there a way I can get my old account ?,positive

"I'm rating at 1 star because the game developed a fatal error which prevented it from opening, and I was forced to uninstall. Reinstallation forced me to start from scratch, thereby wasting all the time and resources I spent on this game.",negative
Love this game so far. Have been running into an issue where the game will crash for seemingly no reason since Gudaguda started though. Nothing was running in the background at those times but I'm confident you'll fix that hiccup soon.,positive
Great story and love the series,positive
"Waifus and saber face¬¥s, do you want something better?",positive
Hella grinding and hella salt but really fun,positive
It is amazing! !,positive
I haven't really got into games for my phone until this amazing game. I can barely put it down it's so addicting. Only problem I have is it always closing in the middle of a battle but that's ok since it saves before it happens. Overall great game and perfect opportunity to get into the Fate series for new fans or expand on it for old fans.,positive
If you spend money on this game and plan to upgrade your phone you will not be able to recover your account.,neutral
This game is awesome I am fan of fate series keep up the good work,positive
Love the game but after the latest update it crashes in the middle of battle for no reason.,negative
"Game is not complete, there are only 3 chapters to play.   The grind is real, so be ready to shell out 30+$ for one set of gacha spins.   Drop rates for 5 star items is so low its pretty insulting.  The gameplay is ok, very repetitive. Decent graphics but animations look ridiculous due to puppet style motion.",negative
Give more freedom for Free Players,positive
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  There is no reward for paying in this game.  Drop rates are so incredibly dismal you'll never get the units you actually want.,negative
Not a very good game but you lose all progress and money spent if you uninstall with out your transfercode which is completely rediculous so if you can avoid this trash,negative
Good time waster but almost impossible to get good characters without paying a heavy price. The price tag for the characters are not worth the gameplay,positive
"it's a great game and a well addition to the fate series, I just wish there was an easier way to retrieve a lost account",positive

"The most harshest gatcha game I've ever known. $300 worth of ""quartz"" won't even get the summon you want from the event banner. Play this game with the mentality of enjoying the story and it should be fine.",positive
Great game for Fate fans and those who are new to new to the series. As it gives enough lore for you to know each unit. The only down side is that there is no autoplay but how the gameplay is I can't see how you could make it work.,positive
Clean,positive
Never thought it would come to the west,neutral
Un buen  app lo recomiendo,neutral

It the best game,positive
Doesn't even boot up,neutral
Good game. Keep it up,positive
Fate Grand Order is a great game with an amazing story but the rates to pull good units is far too low. Normally this would be ok but there are hardly any handouts for long time free to play players. And the cost to buy currency is back breaking. $200+ is the expected cost for 1 unit.  Please address one of these issues. This game would be an easy 5 stars but the lack & cost of currency makes it difficult to recommend this game to anyone.,positive
"The game itself is great, but the servant draw rates are atrocious. Not a single 5 star servant in over 200 draws.",positive
This game is fun so far.üëå,positive

"Simple, casual, and fun. Collecting your favorite servants is a blast and the casual aspect allows the game to be played at any pace you wish. The rates aren't as good as some other gatcha games for the gatcha itself, but it isn't enough for me to knock a star off. Great game.",positive
Fantastic game that makes you wanna raise your waifu with pride!,positive
Just what you would expect from a type moon project lol,positive
Awesome game play,positive
Its a really fun game overall can't get enough of it. Love the Fate series and this just makes it better!,positive
"A game to avoid unless you have money and like the franchise. The only good things in this game are the story and the characters. Sadly the rate for heroes you like is down right scam(1%) and even if you would want to put money to get who you want the price is absurdly high for still 1%. There's no pity system so pull rate never get better even after putting 300 quartz(pulling money) which is 100try. So for characters it's more like ""you can look but you can't touch""  The combat system is plain boring. Combined with drop rate for mats almost as low than SSR pulling, you get a soul crushing farming, that take hours to do for in the end getting nothing. No auto feature, no animation skip and slow even at x2.  The quality is also really unequal. You have some really good art but also some horrible one. Sometime the story is great, sometime you think it as been wrote by a 3years old. The animation for some hero is really neat but for most it's a generic animation made with paint.",positive
"Great gameplay, awesome game. Keeps improving and keeps getting better",positive
"The game is great overall, but I kinda wish that you add more event frequently and add more updates so it's catch up the jp ver.",positive
"Nice game, Marie is Cutie",positive
I love this game but it constantly crashes. That and the file size are my only real complaints. But this game is amazing for a phone game,positive
"Anyone that watch or read the anime should get the game since it beyond fantastic. Great gameplay, storyline, characters, combat is simple, good time waster, and overall a great game. I wish there was a game like this on the Xbox One or PS4.",positive
Good game but stupidly expensive. One 10 card premium draw will cost around $20.00 USD  Two of those and one could buy Fate/stay in full.,negative
Love the fate series and this game,positive
It is ok but the oide one is better,positive
"Good game overall. A bit disappointed, game has no pvp or multiplayer feature.",negative
"An excellent turn based RPG that has an excellent story and is a great tie in to the Fate TypeMoon franchise but also serves as a good introduction to those who haven't had much experience with Fate. The game mechanically isn't difficult but does possess some depth to it for those who like to min Max. The gacha is infamous but the game is rather fair for its kind of free to play mobile gaming, but is a pretty good salt mine, bad civilization if you catch my drift but worth it. Most notably the game is able to be completed, and the most difficult challenges overcome with out spending any money but does require more skill. I'd suggest it if you are at all into Fate or Japanese rpgs.",positive
Best game ever!!,positive
"I used to like this game but since I lost my account and I'm not even able to bind it to my Facebook account for easy recovery, send an email to try to recover but it was impossible. Art is great but the gameplay is somewhat tepid to be honest. Not playing this game again in the foreseeable future.",positive
Really great game. Especially if you like the Fate series,positive
"While a glorified source of gambling problems for many, I think this is alright as a game. Tho I do find the inclusion of an energy bar is a bit annoying.",positive
"The translations need work and the gacha rate is insanely low (but thats just me being salty), overall its a great game! Not really a game to play on-the-go in my opinion. The story content is amazing which is very surprising for a mobile game. I thought the game and battle system was insanely simple but the farther I progress in the story and during events (like Nero fest *cries*) it becomes more challenging and has depth. Characters are also very lovable and original (except for the saber faces...). I love how unlike other mobile games 4-tiers and below are basically useless but in this game even my rarity 3 characters can surpass my 5 tier characters. Cu is best dog (e).",positive
"Beautiful game with decent graphics but combat is pretty dull and lifeless. Also the drop rates are some of the lowest I've ever seen in a game. If you're not planning to spend copious ammounts of real money, don't hold your breath on getting good units.",negative
Galaxy s8. Game stopped working recently. Please fix,positive
Would like to rate the game higher but after two reinstallations can't even open the game once to play.,positive
"The game is fun but there are a few issues. Costs are high and rates are abysmal. Costs about 40$ for a couple of 10x pulls. The rates are so low that even during an event with boosted rates, you are still almost certainly not going to get what you're after. You can stockpile free resources rather than spend money. Two weeks of dailies and logins will let you do roughly 3 single pulls. Took over 120 pulls to get a 4 star (not the rarest) character that had a boosted drop rate. During those pulls I received zero 5 star characters. During the halloween boosted draw, I actually spent some money along with my stockpile for a total of 91 pulls. This time I actually got two 5 star characters...neither of them were the character with the boosted drop rate. So yeah, the game is fun, but you have to play with the mindset that you will almost certainly NOT get the characters you want.",positive
"Fantastic, addicting, amazing! Hoping that they rerun some of the old events to get some of those special variant Servants.",positive
I'll never understand why it keeps on freeze up on me I can't play it I wanted saber so much that I would do anything to get her,negative

I like the storyline and the servants aswell as non-servant character development and design. Medusa is still my favorite in the fate series. It's too bad she didn't have more screen time to devil in the story more...,negative

"Having a lot of fun playing, just need to get Jeanne d'arc and I'll he happy",positive
Its really good but if only there was a way to get lots of crystals.,positive
It's the best game ever,positive
"I like this game. But something just ain't right with the summons. I have summoned 15 time on an event summons and have still not gotten the 5 star that is ""supposedly"" had its drop chance risen. I have, however, received other 5 stars. The way this game does summons is ridiculous. I don't mind paying, but there has to be a limit. When you've paid enough to pay for someone salary and you still can't get a summon that is supposedly easier get, that is called a bug, or it is intentional for screwing people out of their money. Otherwise, if you avoid the summons, it's fun.",positive
Great stuff,positive
Love how the game is made very fun and a good story,positive
You can kind of play with friends. Friends benefit definitely! But love it. One of my favorite anime love the story twist.,positive
I just love this game story and the graphics are are very nice plus character design is nice. The only thing that pain me is the gotcha rate for higher tier characters is very low but i still love this game,positive
It's fun I guess.,positive
The help from cs to get my account back is trash,positive
To expensive to buy anything worthwhile in the game store & takes to long to lvl characters to progress in the game.,positive
This game is really fun and I really love the game,positive
Its amazing its bring back memories from the anime,positive
"I'm sure I would love this game if I could manage to launch it. Currently crashes on start on my tab s3. Sent an email to the devs with the error code/description... Hopefully the devs fix this issue soon :)  Update: So apparently the problem is that I have USB Debugging turned on and that they purposly make the app abruptly quit if this setting is turned on. Since I am a developer and I need this setting turned on (I'm sure a lot of other people feel this way as well), this app is now useless to me... I'm sure the devs of this app took did this to minimize cheating.... But 90% of the people  who have this setting turned on don't have it for any malicious purpose... Oh well... Such a shame.... Fate is one of my favorite animes....but I will be uninstalling this one...",positive
At least in bleach brave souls it has a 3% chance of getting a 5 star but in this game it's just a mere 1% I would like to see it buffed up to maybe a 3%  and sometimes a summons that gives double chance,positive
Love  the  game and I  enjoy  everything  but  the  low gotcha rates.,positive
It goooodddd,neutral
"Wish the summoning was better and that they would update the story faster, but other than that its alright. It is not the best game, but they can improve. I also hope that the developers would actually listen to players and do something about the summoning system. Because as it stands for me its a big draw back.",positive
Amazing very fun,positive

A game that nails the ascetic of the fate franchise while still being a card collecter mobile game. I am interested in the visual novel being told but not so much the rpg grind.,positive
Its fantastic,positive
It's fate dude.,neutral
"Really enjoyable game. The gameplay seems simple at first glance, but the higher level content requires planning and strategy. Nearly every servant is viable to use and it's fun coming up with unusual teams to challenge yourself. The story is pretty good, especially compared to other mobile games. If you're a fan of the fate franchise I'd definitely recommend it. Even if you aren't already a fan I think you should give it a shot. It works as a standalone story and introduction to the franchise.",positive
Love it fun game to play but we need more waifus!,positive

Very well put together localization needs a bit of work but overall stellar,positive
I enjoy it when I can play it but it crashes every 5 minutes,positive
Pony i spy i love game but they took the game off the play store,positive
Its pretty good - the only downside is that its a huge drain on my battery and it takes up a lot of space.,positive
"Customer support is 11/10, game is fun, doable by playing for free since you can earn paid currency but rather tempting to buy until you look at the rates. Wish there was noble phantasm skip button but o well. Best to play after familiarizing yourself with the fate series a little. Movie pretty much covers the prologue. And reading the other 1* reviews, MAKE SURE TO BIND YOUR ACCOUNT and keep the bind code somewhere handy. Then you won't lose your account :) - my room-&gt; scroll down -&gt; issue transfer",positive

I just recently got into the Fate series and I love this game,positive
I love it! It's really fun to play,positive
"A good game for the longtime fate fan, and I'd think not a bad place for a newbie to be introduced to the series, spoilers on certain Servants identities notwithstanding. It isn't perfect- for one thing, some of their choices on Servant designs can be bizarre, nonsensical, and to a certain mindset even insulting, and the proliferation of genderbent characters without any sort of justification is one of the few major problems I've had with this franchise over the years. Nevertheless, it certainly won't be a waste of your time to check this out- though if your not careful, it might end up being a huge cash sink as you attempt to role your favourite characters.",positive

"The quintessential ""gacha"" game; if you hated them before then this absolutely won't change your mind. However if you're in the mood for a simplistic, turn based ""match three"" style battler with a convoluted, pretentious storyline, attractive people of both genders in tight costumes, and a charmingly bad translation, then I've got good news for you: this will sate that weirdly specific craving.",negative
I loved this game but I forgot to make a transfer code when I upgraded to my note 8 and trying to prove I'm the owner of my old account is proving very difficult. I have three friends that can verify that I pulled both Gilgamesh and Jeanne d'Arc the night I joined as I can't remember a whole lot of details of my account. I might not even bother playing again because I put too much work in it. I don't exactly have a reason to lie about the authenticity of me being the account holder but aniplex doesn't take peoples word I guess. Well it was fun while it lasted.,positive
Perfect... only if new singularities where released faster i want london now,positive
"I love this game and the fate series,but there is one thing that bothers me I have glitch were all the cutscenes and cards are pink. Nothing but pink",positive
"The drop rate of high star servants is way too low. They are blatantly ripping people off and it's disappointing how many people support it. I got a 5* servant on my first ten roll while others won't get their first 5* for months because of the low drop rate combined with the slow rate of gathering gems. It's absolutely unacceptable that paying $400 does not even guarantee a 5* servant because it's at a fixed rate of 1%. And fans defend this garbage because they're addicted to gatcha gambling while fanfaring that because the game is PvE only and can be ""beat"" by low star servants that it is somehow completely natural and warranted for this anti-consumer practice.  The drop rate for ascension items are also so low you're forced to mindless grind the same dungeon thousands of times for a single item and people will support this because of the fanatical obsession with the property and dismiss it as a mobile game flaw.  Also the amount of content runs out quickly and the team is proven to be time gating content. This is a translation and are releasing content slower than the original release timeline. They are probably just slowing down the content releases to milk the whales as much as possible each month. People praise the thin story like it's anything special because it's connected to the fate franchise. The dialogue choices give a false sense of choice and illusion to fool fanatics into feeling like they are experiencing the original VN. The choices have no bearing on anything because the characters respond identically 90% of the time for either option and the choices presented to you are usually the same as well.  Half of the animations in this game are an absolute joke where they just raise their arm and fire a projectile for pretty much the entire caster class except 5*s. Some of these animations have been updated but many are still just some of most lazy animations I've ever seen. Also who thought it was a great idea to have the back button on android to mean close the entire game instead of going back to the previous screen. It is completely intuitive and something that could easily be changed.  It's a decent game with an average story, good art, and good gameplay mechanics but has some of the most terrible consumer exploitative practices that I have ever seen that also devolves into mind numbingly boring dungeon grinds after the story missions while the team waits to drain whales each month.",positive
"Love the game though the summoning part might be a little rough. Rolling for the servants you want is pretty hard, other then that everything is fine.",positive
It's a fun game but my biggest problem with this is that the chances of you getting what you wanted so slim if they allow you to at least buy one of your favorite servants in a make up for it the rest of the problems to draw system,positive

"Really like this game.  I'd like the drop rates to be higher and for servants and craft essences to have different summons or at least bump up servant summon chances.  Biggest issue is the localization.  Many conversations don't flow, and feel choppy, like somebody didn't proof read them.  And then there's some names.  Altria is not the name given to saber in the West at all.  Not remotely.  Please fix the localization.  It's easily the most annoying part of the game for me",positive

"This game is pretty fun, I love that they finally brought the Fate franchise to North America and on Android. I'm a fan of the series and sincerely hope that they continue to add more Fate games to Android.   Now about this game's gameplay and mechanics, the game is a gacha type where you level up and ""ascend"" or evolve your legendary heroes from history that of course have some fictional liberties taken to add interest. King Arthur, Joan of Arc, etc. You get to learn bits about the actual legends and it renews interest in historical and mythical figures. I looked up so much because of this app out of curiosity and learned so much. I love that they are continually adding content and that you can really enjoy the ride.  My only complaint is that when it acts like an RPG your options make no difference to the story. Which is a bit disappointing since it appears to give you control when you have none. However this is a relatively small complaint.   I also feel like the in game currency you can buy is really overpriced compared to other games. In order to summon ten craft essences or heroes you have to pay about $24.00.  Which is pricey as that's the only way to guarantee a 4 star craft essence or hero. I'd be more understanding if it was $10.00. Which compared to other games can still be considered a bit much, but I'd be much more likely to buy especially with the 1% five star drop rate.   But honestly I love the game, I haven't spent much on it because frankly I can't justify $24.00 for 10 things. But if I'm close to saving up enough of the gift currency I buy enough to finish the most I've spent is $5-10 that way. Honestly I would spend much more if it was priced a bit lower.   I love the art and effort put into the game and I have logged in pretty much religiously since it came out. I don't mind grinding for ascension materials or waiting for new content because they have lots of events that fill in the time.   Thank you for bringing Fate/Grand Order to North America! &lt;3",positive

"I was never really a fan of the Fate universe, but the story in this has really kept me engaged!",positive
Game is good for fans of the anime but the spawning rates are a bit low for the amount of work it takes to earn one saint quartz and you need at least three to get a summon that will most likely be a craft essence than an actual servant. Wish they would separate the spawns between servants and craft essences as it makes summoning a servant (especially if it's not a weak duplicate)  extremely rare.  You end up with more craft essences than you will need for the majority of what little servants you have/eventually get. The battles will start to feel repetitive and lose it's luster when you spend all your mana prisms on summon tickets(which has a limited amount before you have to wait for 16+ days to be able to exchange again) and saint quartz for summons that will turn out to be things you predict them to be. I liked the game at first but it's poor spawn rates have really made me kinda wander from the game a bit as of late.,negative

They're starting off pretty good but they're pretty expensive they want too much money for too little I've already purchased about almost $80 worth of there gems and didn't really get anything that I wanted was trying to go for a 5-star servant but did not get one you would think by putting at least $80 that you would at least get one five-star servant considering that they have advertising in Giant gold letters that the drop rate is up but it actually is not the rates are very low you'll get good crafting items but that's about it so don't hope for too much as far as obtaining a good servant and as far as putting money on to this game I will not be doing that anymore they're way too expensive for too little and they have horrible deals,positive
"Honestly, a disappointment. I'm not a huge Fate fan, but I was expecting at least /some/ quality with such a big franchise, and with all the hype that FGO has been getting. But, the battle system is simply ""all right"", and the translation stinks. At least get a proofreader to double-check for errors before release! Also, for a game that's been launched so long elsewhere, it's pretty sad that it managed only two and a half chapters (with terrible translations) in it's English/global launch. I play a lot of mobile games in general, and if this one didn't have the Fate brand attached to it, I would have uninstalled after the first few days. As it is, I'm sticking it out to see if things improve. (But I'm not going to hold my breath.) Oh, and this has one of the worst gacha rates I've ever had the displeasure to experience. And I've experienced /a lot/.",negative

"As a fan of the Fate series my review is a bit biased, but this game is fun. It's simple to pick up and play, nothing complex. But with all games this one has some ups and downs.  Without major spoilers, you're part of an organization called Chaldea, and it's up to you to summon heroes from mythology, called Servants, to help save the world. Seems overused but the game has it's own unique way of telling the story.   The graphics look great, though while each Servant you use have their own designs the enemies are almost all the same. Maindifferences in enemies are usually some re-coloring or they're holding different weapons. This isn't bad per-se seeing as we, the players, are still in the early part of the game.  Continuing onto the servants, each one has their own set of skills, looks, and ultimate attack called a ""Noble Phantasm"" or ""NP"" for short. And there are a wide assortment of heroes you can summon. From the fan favorite Saber aka King Arthur to Emporer Julius Caesar.  Each servant falls into a ""class"". Saber, Archer, Lancer, Caster, Assassin, Rider, and Berserker. Each class their own strength and weakness.  Now some bad things to note that exist at the time of this review. Since the game hasn't been out for too long in the US you will see multiple of the same servants all the time. This is only a timed problem because more servants are being released in the near future.  Another thing is many servants have the same attack animation. When you play the game you'll understand what I mean. But I did say many and not all. Reason is a few servants have their own specific attack animations. These usually consist of the fan favorite servants of bones fans will instantly recognize.  One fin thing to wrap up this review, if you do not, I repeat, DO NOT like random gambling then you probably won't like this game. Reason I say this because to get servants you spend the currency, saint quartz, to summon them. Each summoning is random and you can either get two or three servants, or even a super rare servant, in a roll. Or you can get craft essences, Which are little cards you can freely give (or take) to a servant for a boost in health, attack, and a craft essence bonus.",positive

Do not waste your money on summons the drop rate is really really low. I was a victim of wasting money and recieved zero 5* ssr that are not available in story. My advice play the game for free. I recieved my only 5* on one lucky summon with cyrstals I earned in story mode. Other than the horrible drop rate on summons the game can be fun it definitely has potential and if you can obtain one of the 5* has great SSR's. Im not spending no more money and the game is enjoyable. My advice play free and grind out the story and events and you will enjoy it.,positive

This game is amazing! Its really fun to go through the story and events. The game doesn't force you to spend money for the premium currency. You have so many chances to get them.

It is awesome!,positive
"If you're into Fate, you'll probably be into this. But as far as I'm concerned: -Game mechanics combine into a clustertruck of features -Inconsistent frame rates -Camera pops into different positions annoyingly  -The story is a thick soup that's not to my taste",neutral
"The game is fun and the controls are easy to learn. The best part of the game comes when you unleash your Noble Phantasms, cutscenes are awesome, especially Emiya and Carmilla. The only downside is the terrible rate of gacha pulls worse than any other game of it's kind. Spent 90 orbs (3 10x pulls) I have been grinding for a week and only have 1 4-star servant. The fact that when you do a 10x gacha pull where you get more pointless craft essences is dumb. Besides the worst gacha rates I have ever seen, the game is really well made.",positive
Hey all I got say to this game as I'm going to give it another try is that for the sake of Fairness they need to have a Banner the doubles the rate of 5 Star Servants otherwise people who play on this WILL rage quit just cause they should get one for all the trouble they go through to get one. Until then it's 3 Star will go up once those Rates change.,negative

"The game wouldn't even launch. It opened an email to send the devs, who promptly told me to disable is debugging.

I wish I'd had the opportunity to at least check the game out, but c'est la vie.",positive
"Great addition to the Fate series. Very loyal to the contents and not shy in design and art of the franchises characters. Original story that can feel dragged on, with little to no impact of your answer choices towards the stories. However, with room to spare and ideas galore, are some of the main points the Fate  series has in growing. So much untapped potential.  Yet, the characters, settings, dialogue and chemistry is some of the best I've seen on mobile platforms. And beyond most anime / novel inspired games and above all of the mobile Shonen games category.  (Fate is NOT Shonen and thank goodness it isn't. This is for people with a conscious and crave deep story telling with no filter. My opinion but is just that.)",positive

I wound up having to delete it and redownload it and now I'll have to make a new character because you guys didn't see fit to have a username and password in case something like this happened.",positive

"Big anime company - poor game.  The game require internet at all time, yet theres no real online feature like co-op, raids, ladder, team, chat, trade, etc...just you grinding the same dungeon to max out your card.

"great game, been waiting for it for some time. the only concern i have is when you need to transfer phones or reset the phone and you don't grab the transfer code. most games currently link to an account (google, facebook, etc) but you need to use a one time transfer code and if you forget to get it, expect to restart",positive

"It's a fun game, great for fans of the fate series. Story is good, and translation is okay. People complain about gacha, but a 5* isn't necessary to progress. Most, if not all, servants are viable if used right. It's fine in jp, why change it here? Only problem is the low drop rates of mats which won't improve until the other maps are added, which will take awhile.",negative

"i love the fate series, however this game does no justice to it. In 4 minutes the game crashed 5 times. it lags horribly, the characters are poorly done combat wise as well. The story is decent but ehh its not worth the headach.",negative
For a free game it's pretty good. It's got a good story and actually got me into the fate series. My only problem with it is that the multi summons with the saint quartz give you almost no heroic spirits and the ones you do get aren't that good. I've played a few games like this and the multi summons from them were more fair. What would be nice though would be more events that reward you with saint quartz. Like Nero fest except it was not very appealing to do at all. Overall I'd give this a 3 out of 5 stars.,positive
This game is what i was looking for a must need for fans of fate/stay night,neutral
Will not even download past 59%,neutral
"Game is great, but needs to hurry up and update more frequently. The Japanese server has a couple years on this, so there is plenty of content, but we are currently still on the same content since release. It becomes so stagnant that doing daily dungeons and quests become more of a chore than it is fun. One short event doesn't help, and we don't even get a summer event while it was summer.",positive
Keeps crashing when ever NP is used. Need to keep reopening game after crashes in hopes every load might be the one where the enemy gives me mercy and doesn't use it.,positive
I do enjoy the game but my phone broke and I've already gotten rid of it. Is there any way to get my account back or am I out of luck?,positive

"This is one of the few mobile RPG games that I enjoy. The combat system is fun and easy to learn, and the unique sprite designs and battle animations are greatly appreciated. The story is decent and full of scenes that made me chuckle. It takes a while to get through the tutorial and actually play the game, but everything after is fantastic. F:GO is a solid mobile game that fans of the series will really enjoy. 4/5.",positive

Just want to say that I'm a big fan of fate and this game and always love the good customer service that is provided by most Japanese games when it comes to down time of their games and want to give a shout out to the developers to make these games playable to everyone outside of Japan.,positive
Designed to fleece you. No mid paid package. Expensive as is. Difference between paid and free paid items for summons... Questionable. Many cards you would think that should be 4 are 3 stars. Just meh. Graphics are good for a mobile. Storyline is eh. Not a fan of grand order. It took some of the shadowy background and made it into garbage. No PvP? Seriously. Just no. Heard from a friend that the US version is gutted versus Japanese version. Will not make the effort to verify this. Update* a few hundred into micro transactions and nothing of any use.,positive
Boring but not bad.,positive
Can't wait for more events,neutral
"Story is pretty lame. Draw pool is super tiny. 1% SSR rate is pretty low. Combat is boring. Menus are not intuitive and take far too long to learn to navigate. If you're not here because you're a die-hard Fate fan, why are you still here? 2 stars cause it's kind of pretty looking and I had no technical problems.",positive
"Fantastic game for Fate fans, though it's been a long time coming. Still in it's early stages in NA, but there's a lot of content on the way. Interesting story and the gameplay is great, seeing all the different combinations of attacks from the different heroes. Lots of grinding involved and the gatcha has low rates for high star characters. But it is beatable without spending anything and even more rewarding when the luck occasionally comes around. The general exp is definitely worth the download, and I'm very excited for future events and updates.",positive
"Play this for the community around it. Gameplay is fun and fair, gacha is harsh as per usual with these games, voice acting is godlike, but its the fate universe and the love the developers have for the game that sets it apart. There is so much official content outside the game itself, and theres always a big event going on or something to look forward to. It's well worth your time (and money, all of your money)",positive
Great game easy combat though I wish there was a bit more combat and less dialog.,positive
Great game with top tier waifus that you have like a 1% chance of getting because GATCHA. 10 umus outa 10.,positive
I think it was awesome,positive
"Grammatical and typographical mistakes interfere with meaning. I don't know if series veterans already know what's going on, but as a newcomer that just likes gacha games, I don't have the same benefit, due in large part to the poor localization.   The localization, in turn, makes the story interminable, indecipherable, and surprisingly mundane despite the fantastic elements that are supposedly happening. It's the game equivalent of a Michael Bay movie; cool window dressing, but strangely, still boring.",negative
Just play it people wouldn't hurt to try it......you might just fall in love with it ahah,positive
"I have been waiting to play a Fate Game for some time, and after watching Grand Order i was excited to see the game. I had some trouble getting it working on the Galaxy S8 +. For those having issue getting it to work you need to have developer mode turned off, otherwise the game will crash and not load.",positive
"I have actually been really enjoying this game. It's hard to get a five star but a lot of 3 star and lower characters perform really good and almost up to par with the 5 star in certain cases. The balancing makes it so you never feel like you can't win as a free 2 player.  In addition the story is pretty engaging, much more so then I would've expected from a mobile game. There are translation errors at times but it's still very much understandable. The gameplay is turn based but uses a card system and also let's you use skills in between each turn.  The graphics are also really nice to look at. And the character sprites have a lot of detail to them with more characters receiving sprite updates in the future adding detail and making their animations smoother  If you like fate or other gacha games (fire emblem heroes, granblue, bleach etc.) there's no reason to not give this a try",positive
The company  basically told me any issues i have are not their problem. Uninstalled and not looking back.,positive
"I love this game, I give it 5 stars all around! The characters are drawn in many different art styles, making each one unique. It has a great story line, with choices and battles in between. You can fast forward the battles. I can wait to see the anime!",positive
The game is alright. It gets very laggy. I wouldnt recommend paying into this game though because the customer service was terrible.,negative
I would probably enjoy it more if I could actually play. I keep running into the issue of it trying to send me to my own email to send an email of an error. One saying my mobile device is incapable of running the app because that app even with it still not being very old compared to its other versions is not compatible with my device.... so I wish I myself could give a better review.

Don't be daunted, give it a try!",positive
"One of the few mobile games I love. It plays nice, the story is interesting, and love the characters.",positive
The gameplay ia fun and addicting. The story keeps you going. Its intereating learning about some of your favorite characters in the fate series. There is ton of content and always events to keep you playing. Very high replay value. There are some cons such as waiting for ap and rng factor of summoning rare servants you want. Also game tends crash once while. There are some rate up events which counter that also. Overall game is very fun and worth downloading. My favorite game played on iso I dont like mamy iso games in general and prefer pc so nice treat to find special one like this.,positive

Fights are ugly and the camera is disorienting. Looks like and is animated like a flash game from 2007. Just a cash grab using the Fate franchise.,negative

Hate to give it a low review but seeing it is unplayable on my phone that well exceeds all of the reqirements I can't give it a good one either. Hopefully they will work on the problems and I will be able to come back and give it a good one.,positive
"It plays more like a visual novel with mobile game elements than a traditional mobile game, the graphics are good and the game play is easy to pick up.  If you are a fan of the Fate series or type-moon in general this game is a must. Even if you are not it is still worth checking out.",positive
"Alright I'm giving this a 5 star rating, since I've been playing since the JP version. I'm a huge Nasuverse fan so this game makes me feel right at home. Everything is solid between the game controls to the music and story. The only thing that I can say is the rate need to be adjusted at least for the servant side of things a 1% chance of pulling a 5 star servant is crazy much less beating the 3% chance it will be a Craft essence instead. Also separate the pools fir servants and Craft Essence, people would buy both considering how the game is designed it is literally a chore to get through anything without decent support essences. This has been my main gripe even as a player of the JP version. Otherwise I love the game keep up the good work and try to push out content a little faster.",positive
This game is an ok time waster and a pretty neat spin-off of the fate series,positive
Would give it five stars if I could link it to Facebook or Google play. I don't like depending on a randomly generated transfer number to keep my account safe.,positive
Good game story bit long and hard to get crystals seems to want you to buy them other wise lots of grinding,positive
"This is more of an anime then a game.  I find the mechanics very convoluted and honestly quite boring.  There isn't any interesting challenges or strategy, it's just a grind-fest with pay to win mechanics allowing you to level easier.  I'm not sure why this game was recommended to me as similar to FE Heroes, it's nothing like it.  I recommend skipping this title.",positive

"Great graphics, gameplay and decent story. But summoning in this game is awful. The summoning pairs units and items, which makes you more likely to get an item rather than a unit. Forcing you to spend money. Skip this app.",negative
I'd really love to have a better review but I can't! And it makes me sad being an avid fan of the fate series. The game won't work on the latest Android so I can't give a proper review!,positive

Get good,positive
"The game is rather slow paced, the battle mechanics feel limited, The quest involve doing the same map several times in a row, and the saint quarts take a long time to build up and are over priced for a full 10 summons. Overall the game has potential, however in its current state, it is much too slow paced and limited. Things to consider would be making combat less random, lower the amount of times needed to compleat story quest, and slightly lower the cost to buy saint quarts. Another idea is auto battle if you want to keep the current battle style because it gets monotonous doing the same thing over and over.",negative

"Download time takes far too long, newer games have initial start up gives you the chance to play the game almost instantly by letting you download the game contents little by little as you progress thus making you decide whether to play or stop.",positive
"It is a solid game if you are a Fate fan. My issue is that it demands too much off a lot of phones.   I would give it more stars once  They fix the crashing issue. An option to shut off battke animations may helo or turn off NP animations.   This game also needs more quests and ways to earn apples for AP restoration. If you somehow pull a good servant you can powerlevel events early on and get good AP (energy) early but after a while, harder quests will easy shortern your playtime to about 5 minutes every few hours. Not really a good thing.  The overlimit on AP when leveling is definitely something to praise since no other gatcha ive played does this and i believe it is absolutely fair and helps newbies tremendously.  Lastly we need to have a way to look at quest rewardd to see where we can get certain item drops like ascension materials so that farming isnt as confusing.",positive

"A decent Montage game with one very large game ruining problem.  The draw are beyond player punishing.  Not only are they some of the worst in mobile gaming period (1% and 3% for the rares), but items are in the same pulls as the units.

"Great game but the lottery system for acquiring servants can mess up an individual to shell put more cash. There is also a lack of ways to acquire a servant, for example, shouldn't there be a ritual summoning for a specific servant like using materials on plus a few saint quartz to summon a specific class servant based on the materials used. Instead it is heavily relied on 1 currency, but i guess that is how mobile games get the revenue.",negative

"Try to take any reviews here lower than 2 with a grain a salt. Most of it is usually being really salty with bad luck on gacha, not a viable excuse as you can get through the jp game using 1-3* servants and free 4* servants you are provided with in events as time passes.  Same for translations, some people forget that JP fate also had typos, which were fixed overtime. Same issue here in NA, they are fixing it as patches come with every update.  My only complaint and issue is them not just having one whole merged server with JP as most of the past players reside there. However, a new slate has established really well here despite some minority disagreements.  Fun game guys. ~",positive

Great art. Great voice acting. Decent game. This game is too much like any other FTP game. As it is set to be boring and grindy unless you are willing to open your wallet constantly.

Low rating because the game refuses to launch on the Galaxy S8 SM-G950U,negative
"Actual download size is 420mb.  Graphics are high quality, but just use puppet animation so it still looks&feels kinda cheap.  Battle system is pretty good, but acquiring new servants through a random lottery doesn't make narrative sense. Same with being forced to bring along another player's servant to help, and merging servants to level them up.  Story was very cool, I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to uncovering more of the plot.  Tutorial was far too railroading. Forcing you to press a particular button to advance.",positive

A fun game but the rates for pulling a servant are kind of low. Used over 100 crystals on the gilgamesh banner. Hardly got any servants. Only got crafts 99% of the time pretty much.,positive
It is so cool,positive
Game won't even open. It just crashes on a galaxy s7,neutral
Great game but they really need to raise the summon rate for servants vs craft essences. Pulled only 2 4 star servants and maybe 10 to 15 3 star ones. But pulled lots of 4 star and 4 5 star craft essences.,positive
Installing this was fate.,neutral
Love everything about besides that the devs don't keep up.to date with the latest version of Android but don't list this in the description at all.,positive

"Fantastic game. First off the story is written by the team that made the visual novels+anime. the battle animation is beautiful, especially for feature servants like Saber or Emiya. +Avoids the pitfalls of mobile. Each servant is viable for the game, instead of having to pay for a 5* drop.",positive

"To me, Fate/Grand Order doesn't feel like your typical mobile game.  It plays more like a Japanese Visual Novel with the expected accompanied rpg elements.  However what makes this a real gem is the engrossing story that is paced depending on the users playtime.  In otherwords, I feel like I'm driving the story, and that's a great feeling to have. It's a rare title among this massive sea of generic mobile games, and I wish more developers made titles like Fate/Grand Order.",positive
Please improve the translations and grammar.,positive

"Great game, just no ssr.",positive
I love the franchise and story overall the game is sublime but their are so many 4-5 stars but if you make the summon rates 1% everyone will be super mad this is not a good way of forcing people to spend money and it ruins the experience pls raise chance,negative
Love the Fate franchise. Glad it's been brought to NA.,positive
"I can't rate anything other than the programming of the app. Why? because it is too poorly engineered for me to even get to anything! On 3 different devices, the app either refuses to launch at all, refuses to connect to the server, or loses its connection every few minutes so that I can't even get past the intro sequence. This is NOT my internet connection.  I was looking forward to this game after all the hype. Very disappointing.",negative

I just wish that when I had played and wasn't in the middle of a battle that it wouldn't keep kicking me off the game and back to my phone screen. My other games don't do that so I don't know if it's a game issue that I hope is fixed I really love the fate series.,positive
Bandwagonshit are pretty dumb they doesn't know what hell await for them in this game mostly of the complaints are all the rate up haha also they getting 3* CE and Servants that also useful but they are too much greedy doesn't mean you have a ssr your already powerful they are low rate servant that can surpass ssr but then I am happy about their complaints and disappointments,neutral
Still wont launch it on my LG phone with Android 7 it wants to load in as a email? Yet it boots up fine on my Samsung tablet. Please fix so I can play it on my phone.,positive
"This game feels very archaic, the style and gameply feel old for even mobile, and the flair of your servants is very underwhelming. On top if this the gacha is the worst Ive experienced. Getting something useful outside of an event is impossible, and the gacha currency is slow to obtain. On top of this the equipment(essences) and unit(servants) rolls are in the same gacha leading to absolutely unwhelming pulls. What a poor old game for the Fate series.",negative
"Overall a fine game, though the Ap system is a tad slow for my tastes, 1 every 5 minutes, and you get upwards of 100? It takes 12 hours before you can reasonably do anything again without spending real money... which is probably the point.",positive
"Played for less then 5 minutes and already feel how badly made this game is.  Just another ""rushed"" product the content owner decided to dish out to milk more money",negative
"Polish the overall combat & character stats. There's no strategy to this game, the characters have two basic stats & it's a gatcha gambler too. Many of us were very optimistic about this game & us real gamers were let down as we usually are with ios/Android mobile games to be fair. The Fate/ Series is Great but this game is bearly a game imo. Maybe part two or v2.3 I'll come back to this but as it stands now in v1.10 this game sucks and i don't understand why you think we would want to invest our money into this. Thank You.",positive

"This is a very fun game, I'm glad it finely came to America!",positive
Fgo does a good job of letting you play in the setting and summoning your favorite servants.,positive
"I love this game. But my two biggest issues with it, are the obviously rediculous gacha, and a certain part of the gameplay. Namely, there is no way to back out of the card selection screen. Otherwise, should the second gripe be fixxed, it would be 5 stars. I do not expect the gacha's chances to be increased, as it is only toeing the line of unreaaonability; not quite over it, despite being something of a grey zone.  Also, with this model of tablet, it's a general problem that applications can't be installed with the SD card mounted. Do not put reviews claiming you can't install it, when you have this model and have a SD card mounted. Just unmount it, install, then remount it. Ignore that it says there isn't enough space. Usualy, it's fine.",positive
This is the peak gacha game. Play this and you don't need to play any others.,positive

this game has some odd issue when it comes to running on my Samsung galaxy s8 + even when im not using it for some reason its having strange errors it even made the device maintenance app on my phone go from blue to yellow which also said it was slowing down my phone and i found out that it was from tapping the fix now on the yellow version on device maintenance and it really helped my phone afterwards when it came to running every other app i have on it aside from that whenever i restart my phone at times i will get a message saying it stopped working just as soon as i unlock my phone in other words i didnt even have the app running and i still got that message,negative

Love it. No complaints. Works great and has great characters. Glad this finally got it's western release.,positive
"Game is nice and easy, rerolling characters is totally worth it, got 2 5 stars in a few tries",positive
"Its fun it just has alot of bugs, for example it constantly crashes like every 10 minutes. Secondly it automatically fast fowards on story dialogue and skips it. Thirdly it is difficult and time consuming to level up heroes. The apps great if you have a newer device.",positive
"I would give a better review but whenever I try to open the app, it brings me to gmail and says its not playable under my playing environment. What do you guys mean by that?????",positive
I really want to like this. The real money cost of summoning currency is crazy. $1.50-$3 per summon depending on the bulk discount. Enemy servants are way op. Exp curves for your servants are steep.,negative
"Probably a good game, but technical issues and unresolved bugs made it unplayable for me.  Definitely needs some work.",positive
It's a really good game the noble phantoms are great and the servants are awesome but it needs more material to level up the servants and needs to fix the lagging a little buy besides that great game,positive
"Gameplay is good. Graphics are wonderful. Drop rates are horrible, really horrible. When they say higher chance, they meant higher chance for them to earn more money. I love the Fate series don't get me wrong and I would like to donate to keep them going and what not, but not to this game anymore. Going back to play Fallen Princess.",positive
It is a good game.,positive
I love the character designs an the gameplay is pretty good,positive

Awesome game but have very very very slow loading,positive
"Fate Grand Order is a game that needs a ton of rerolls if you're not lucky and get a good Servant. The gameplay is neat, but everything takes too long to load and the fights feel anticlimactic because there is not really a time limit. And for rerolls, restarting the game just once takes around 5 minutes because of the additional files you need to download when you start the app after downlading it. In conclusion, the game is really good, only the speed of it should be increased.",positive
FINALLY!!!!!!!!,neutral
"Great Game Overall, my only critique is that i would think having three of your own servants instead of 2 and 1 Friend would be much more enjoyable",positive
So I really like this game and i love the fate franchise.The gameplay is spot on and fun. The noble phantasms are awesome. But the gatcha is absolutely terrible. Just today i spent $80USD and got absolutely Nothing of value. Not even a single 4star servant. I will likely continue to play this game but I will NEVER spend any more money on it. The drop rates are the most garbage in any mobile game ive played. The amount of salt that I have over my purchase and lack of value is far too much to say that this is a good game overall.,positive

"This game is disrespectful. It does not value time spent playing. Material faming is a joke. Summon rate is atrocious at 1% chance to get an SSR. Quartz is too expensive. They don't even give us 1 quartz a day, just every other blue moon. You won't really get anywhere unless you sell your soul to Satan just to get rich and buy quartz and have 1% chance of pulling something good. I have a ton of craft essence which is really getting old at this point and so few servants to use them on. Devs are greedy AF. The game is trickled to the brink of being unplayable if you don't pony up. Could have been a very good game, sadly the devs are full of themselves. I say skip this if you're not a billionaire. Or just play the fate stay night hentai game, at least that one is actually satisfying and you get to see the characters getting it on with each other.",positive
Great game i love how much depth and design they put in great work aniplex,positive

"Overall, the game is amazing! The only problem is its a little short currently, and after you finish the singularities that have been released, you can't get anymore gems except through the login or if you buy them, which makes it hard to do the summons and get new characters to prepare for chapter 3.",positive

Abysmally low drop rates for a game that expects to have your favorite servants as 5 star only pulls,negative
"Doesn't work on LG v20, keeps opening my PayPal app and that's it, literally unplayable.",neutral
"It's a quaint time waster of a game, but overall it lacks any real end game. The game is stunningly beautiful, and is very addicting, but it really just falls short.  The Gatcha summons for 4/5 stars are shared with equippable craft essence, so if you want to summon the high tier servants, be prepared to reroll or drop money. The drop rates for the servants themselves are bad enough, so its just insulting to pull 3 of the same servant in one 10-roll.  The servants themselves don't really matter (at this moment). Because as long as you have a 4 star servant decently leveled, you can progress through the game using friend support alone.  There is no PVP, so there's not really much options to play beyond the story.  Leveling a unit is basically a grindfest. You have to play certain daily quests for drops of exp to synthesize with your unit. Problem is getting to higher levels require ridiculous amounts. If the game would give exp after quests it'd be bearable.  Overall, fun game, but atm nothing to invest heavily on.",positive
"Overall the game is well adapted. The graphics are decent enough without being to the point of lagging down the game. Also  the game play itself is very enjoyable for those that like turn based combat.   However the main issue with the game is that once you press the blue battle start button for attacking, you cannot go back to it until the next turn, which is inconvient for those that may want to activate skills they forgot to.   Besides that, well done",positive
"Laggy but playable, really like it.",positive

"Some of the most fun I've ever had playing a mobile game. I can't speak for how it holds up to the original JP release, but I adore FGO. I've been taking my time to savor the experience. The game play is fun, easy to pick up but challenging and rewarding to master, deeper than it first appears, and every character is unique and lovable. It DOES require some previous knowledge of the Fate franchise before you play, in my opinion, but as someone whose knowledge is limited to the original VN and Fate/Zero, it did a good job of making characters from Apocrypha, Extra, and etc. Understandable and fun to watch. All in all, I would recommend. Whether you casually farm daily quests and summon or sit down and dedicate your time to the story missions, I find it to be a fun experience.",positive
"Awesome game but every time I play it, after awhile, the game exits out. Why? Please help fix this.",positive

"Honestly everything is good except for the rates. As a free to play gamer, it is nearly impossible to get ANY 5 star character you want without reinstalling many times.  I am currently reinstalling as I write this and it is frustrating.  I may have wanted to spend money on this game but seeing how the rates are, I am not going to throw money down a black hole.",positive
"The devs have decided to make this game extremely picky about the kind of environment it can be played on. By that I mean it has QUITE a few specific error codes that crash the game if your phone is rooted, or if you even have USB debugging on! I understand this is to reduce likelihood of hackers but it's just picky over such common things that make it extremely annoying.   And good luck if it mistakenly throws you error codes. Then there is literally nothing you can do. You can't play, period.",negative
Good games,positive
"It's a really fun and nostalgic game. My only complaint is the horrendous chance of getting a 4 star or higher servant. All of my guaranteed 4 stars so far have been crafting essence, which I have quite enough of at this point.

Constant Crashing on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and that kills the fun. The crashes make battles harder then they should be.

When my friends have multiple 5* servants and I'm struggling with a 3* and a 4* as my best with not one good drop from the summon system, it really sours my experience. Why spend money on more chances when the drop rate has given me a middle finger thus far?",neutral
Some issues here and there but it's pretty good. How can I contact support?,positive
Any fan of the Fate franchise will love this game. As a free player it's also very balance in regards of pay to win,positive
The game crashes every time i try to open it.,neutral
"Great graphics and a pretty decent story for a mobile game, but the gameplay itself... The battle system is so dull, I can only play in short bursts before the game becomes too tedious to continue.",negative
"It's a fun game to play i really enjoy it. Its bit of a hassle that each transfer number only works for that account once before you have to get another , but its better then having to start over entirely",positive
Love it so much it's really fun and addicting though I have bad luck in summoning but still awesome,positive
I'm having terrible luck with the summons but I still find this game incredible fun.,positive
"the game keeps closing out on me on its own so i can't keep playing the game it does this every couple minutes plz fix this and I'll easily change this to a five star and now that is to the update it is happening even more than before please i beg u fix this, this game looks so good but it keeps closing on me every couple seconds",positive
The game wouldant load for me even tho the update says it fixed bugs it just DIDNT!!! LIKE MY GOD!!,negative
Server issues but it functions when it functions,neutral
"I'm only rating four stars because the full game isn't implemented yet, when the third singularity and up are implemented, I will give it five stars",neutral
Will not run on my Pixel. Crashes at launch.,neutral
"It's a great game. But turn on USB debugging because you want to give an app some permissions to track wakelocks, and this app throws a fit. Took me about 5 minutes to stop the app from running because it keeps restarting itself after closing, but because I enabled USB debugging, it keeps throwing error messages in Gmail and kept redirecting me to the Gmail app repeatedly. This shouldn't be an issue on any app.",neutral
"I've been waiting for this game to come to global for quite a long time, so thanks Aniplex Inc. for your hard work. This game is amazing and I can't wait for global vers. to reach the point where the japan vers. is now, although the the gacha rates for 5 and 4 stars are pretty low, I don't really mind since I've played many summoning games before, and this'll be the first app game I'll be spending lots of money on, so I hope you continue making the game better, and again, thanks for your hard work",positive
Too low rates. Too low to spend money on. Will reconsider if rates improve. FE Hero's at the very least has 3% increasing. Not 1% flat and F.U,negative
"It's a wonderful game! Addictive and fun! The only reason it's missing a star from me is due to the fact that, I have terrible luck and can't stand the drasticly low chances of pulling a 4* + Servant..",positive
It definitely appeals to anyone who likes the fate universe and is also an entertaining mobile game,positive
It's really bug on wifi. Certain events can't be entered. Pressing back causes app to close rather return to the main screen. Needs better connection performance.,positive
Wont run on verizon note 5,neutral
ive sold my soul to this,neutral
"It's a great game with fun characters. It's just keeps saying ""Connection Lost: Retry?"" I do retry but it's not working. Help?",positive
Good game just wish the 5 star summons had a higher drop chance,positive
"Obvious translation errors. Worst gacha draw rates I've seen in NA market. Transfer code system is archaic; bind to an email, cloud save, or other means",negative
Thank you for fixing the issue the game is terrific.,positive
Thank you for finally bringing this out in English and letting us play this game. It's has lived up to my expectations in every way.,positive
Really entertaining with all my favorite servants! Excited to see what's next.,positive
"I absolutely love this game, it's awesome. The only problem is that there isn't enough characters! Need to add more fast because it gets boring playing with the same characters after a while but great game with a bright future.",positive
"I love the game because of the fate/stay franchise and the game itself is almost a new show, but I'm worried about how they are going to keep updating and making the game fun and interesting in the future.",positive
"If not for the gacha hell, it would be perfect. RIP wallet",negative
"In case there is anyone having trouble playing the game: please turn of developer mode as the game won't start until that is turned off. Also rooted devices won't be able to play it, purpose of this is because of anti hack and cheat. This was in japan as well so Delight Works decided to do this.  Else l, the reason why we can't play the fame is because it's currently under maintenance.",positive
Great game for fans of the anime,positive
downloaded this waste of time and got an error and sent to my email SCREW THIS GARBAGE GAME!!,negative
Is the fact that this actually has a story to it and not just a cheap mobile game is why this is getting five-star,neutral
An amazing game,positive
"Literally slaughters your battery, but fun no less.",positive
Best gacha game by a mile,positive
"Longtime player of the Japanese release. Thank you for bringing FGO to English!  The English launch had some (very) small issues, most of which have been entirely fixed. Excited to help new players!",positive
I'm a huge fan of the fate series so I'm happy this is finally out in English! The gameplay is simple and the graphics are really nice. I do however take issue with the drop rate of 1% for 5 star servants. It's absurdly low and I keep getting duplicates of the same characters and have more rare essences than servants. I hope this is made better cause it is VEXING. Even still it is great game to play with plenty of challenge.,positive
This is why I love the Fate/ series,positive
Game is great but incompatible with andriod o. Can you add compatibility so I could play again,positive
It just asks what application do I want to launch this in?  There's is no game?,negative
Draw dropping amazing!,positive
Ive recently lost an account because i forgot to reissue code and lemme tell you the support for FGO is god awful,negative
I love the game only one thing it's practically impossible to get a 5 star character or higher because of crafting essences i honestly believe you should seriously make a separate summoning for crafiting essences so it's easier to get better characters otherwise it becomes  a pay to win game,positive
"Gets an automatic 1 star from me due to their restrictions on rooted/jailbroken devices or devices that are on custom operating systems. If you have a rooted device or even an unrooted device running anything else besides a stock firmware, you will not be able to play this game.   It saddens me to see a game developer that would sooner write off an entire demographic of possible customers simply because they are either incapable or just too damn lazy to secure and protect their game from hackers/cheaters.",negative
Gives an error and fails to open if your device is rooted or has an unlocked bootloader.,negative
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH,positive
game is very slow crashes a lot,neutral
If ur a fan then just try it :D,positive
Awesome game play love the fate series I love saber she my favorite character from the series you should give people ultra rare items for great reviews just a idea,positive

"As a longtime JP player and avid Type-Moon fan I was simply ecstatic when they revealed that this game was getting localized. I'm not really bothered by the translation. (You have to remember that this game was a niche title in Japan as well) They did the translation pretty well. I was expecting the usual machine-like apathetic kind. But they actually added life to the characters (W-whassup my homies!). The script was pretty confusing even in Japanese, so you can tell that the translators had the odds against them, but they did the best they could. All in all it's a solid localization. Can't wait for the upcoming events",positive
Been playing since the original JP server. Is kinda slow right now but once Halloween event hits the game will be faster and more fun. People make a data transfer code if you want to transfer across devices if you don't you'll lose your account. If you lose your account contact fate_go English account recovery and fill out the form to get you account back if lost.,positive
Fun but kind of messy. Why even have a type/weakness if you can just throw an evade skill and completely avoid everything? Small things like that are what made me ultimately give up on this game. (and many others like it),positive
"Fantastic game. Good story, good combat system etc. My only complaint is the drop rate for 5 star servants is only 1% which is insanely low considering how long it takes to acquire the needed currency to summon at all. Even so, top marks.",positive
Ok I would give it full 5 stars but omg the tutorial doesn't hold your hand it forces it. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a game forces you to do what it wants for a long time. It riped me out of the experience and made it so that I could not finish the tutorial in one go. It became more of a chore that I'd come back to. Once you get to the actual game though it's an amazing game.,positive
"If the game immediately crashes and you get error code 43, make sure USB debugging is disabled from the developer console.",negative
"Great game for fans of the Fate series! Summon rates are HARSH for 5 star servants, though (1%).  Wish it had PvP, or some sort of cooperative content. Maybe some sort of raid system or two guilds compete to be a boss faster than the other. I don't know but great game for what it is. Just needs another mode that allows players to interact with one another.",negative
Always wanted an app icon that brings me to my home screen after 5 seconds!! Thanks!!!,positive
"Great game over all, I just hope they'll add more servants and events.",positive
Error code couldn't play on Nexus 6p,negative
Its so cool and i really love the anime and game.,positive
Tried re-downloading and starting up app. Error 43. I'm sure I am not the only one with this problem. Would rather put a no star but can't. Been a week ago now since English release.,negative
I would  give  it a accurate  review if I could  get  it to install . Ever time I try to  I get  a   message  saying  that  I don't  have  enough  space. I have   nearly   5gb  of  free  storage  and  it won't  install .,positive
This is my Dream Game!!!!!,positive
"Overall I am really loving the game.  I can overlook the translation errors,  and going into this I already knew about the pull rates so as salty as it can be it is what it is.  I've been a huge fan of the fate series for a long time now, and am extatic that I can now not only play but understand the game.  I'm sorry some people feel like the translation is horrible and game breaking, or the people not happy about the pull rates being so low.  I feel at least in my opinion it can be looked past because it's a very fun game I look forward to the great events heading our way, and expanding story.",positive
Pretty good game although leveling up Servants in the beginning feels really slow.,positive
Game won't load.,neutral
"All right this is what i have been waiting for. You guys should make it so we can by certain characters. Of course for me it will be rider aka meduse or saber aka aruther version. The main problems with the game is the taxing load times, also the very very low gacha. All i get is essance cards when i do get a servant card its always a 3 low level star even when i use the 30x summon. This should be fixed",negative
Doesn't run.,neutral
Unplayable. Attempting to open it freezes my phone for a second then it opens up an email with an error message attached,negative
Crashes when launched,positive
Just slow and messy,negative

"Can't even get the game to launch, it says error 43 but nothing else. I read that it might have to do with phone being jail broken but mine is not please fix I really love the fate series",negative
Good casual game. However it's pay2win if you are hardcore gamer.,positive
"I was really excited to play this game but I cant even get the game to launch. When I try to start it up I'll get  a quick white screen, and then it'll go to my gmail acc. saying that I can't play it and it wants me to send this error code to the support email. The code is an error 43 and I don't know how to address the issue.",negative
Great game! A must have for fans of the fate series.,positive
"App won't open. And from the other reviews I can tell I won't enjoy it even if I could, due to the bad localization. Will be waiting for them to roll in the updates.",negative
"An all-around quality game, especially for mobile: Good story, graphics, sound, and gameplay. It isn't even ""Pay 2 Win"", as while getting 5 star servants is definitely immensely satisfying, 3-4 star servants are definitely still powerful on their own.",positive
"Overall the game is fun. Scoring 3 stars due to the fact that there is no support to play across multiple devices. There is the option to transfer save data to another device, but you can only do this once, ONCE. You would think with today's technology that some type of cloud saving would be used.",positive
cant play the game on OnePlus2 phone,negative
I have been waiting for this game to come out since it was announced it was coming out in the US.  It did not disappoint.  My favorite part is the story.  It gave a very good reason for summoning servants and fighting with them.  I like how you can choose what you want to say.  I have never seen something like that in a mobile game like this before.,positive
"Tried installing and playing it. It just wants me to send you an email as to why it won't work. I did that, but if you can't make a working product you'll never see my business. Uninstalling now.",positive
"As a player who played the Japanese version, I know this game is great. But the English really needs some more proofreading. There are so many typos, mistakes and grammar errors. It makes me doubt if there is no actual proofreading team working. Hope things can be better in next update.",negative
"I would really like to start play this game and spend a bit of fortune in it but, I restarted like 20 times w/o 5* so.. u just lost a customer :)",positive

Any one dropping less then 5star is a Jerk. This is a phenominal title import.,negative

Please add support for Android Beta,positive
Why cant i leave you,neutral
"Needs improvement, but good job. Card images not working, cut scenes just showing pink, and can't read the loading or agreement screens.",positive
Great game been waiting for this for awhile now.  And for those people who cant get the game running stop complaining and ask for them to fix it.  IF you get errors and sent to email to download that means your phone can t support it or you have a rooted device.  Japan is extremely against cheating so rooted devices won't work at all.,negative
This game Is amazing,positive
A-mei-zing,neutral
Why is there so much security against users with rooted phones??? This is too extreme and you are losing a good percentage of your users because of this. I'd love to play this game but I can't...,positive
I think the game is trash because of errors and it will not let me play the game so if they find out how to fix it I'll rate differently thank you.,negative
"Great, the summoning could use a little work though",positive
"I really love the story, characters, and gameplay; my one draw back is the fact that their are errors and glitchs still in the game. Example being screen going black during character special moves.",positive
If you're a fan of Type Moon's Fate series. This game is a must for aspiring masters.,positive

I really dislike that character will just continue attacking a dead creature for thousands of damage instead of just moving on to the next enemy.  What a waste.,negative
Game crashed a lot on me still good but keeps crashing,positive
"Games great, RNG sucks tho",positive
Awful localization. Continuous crashing. Would love to play and enjoy it. Hopefully it gets some major fixes soon.,positive
I have played then Japanese version and it's amazing now being able to actually read what the story line is saying I love it. Brings a whole new light to the game itself. Great game play as well.,positive
"Great game,there was an issue,but the develepors responded to my email in 5 min and told me the issue so i can play.I recomend this game to any fan of the fate series",positive
"At the time of this review (June 30), I have played 50+ hours since launch  If that doesn't tell you it's good, then the fact that besides minor hardware optimization issues, it's the best RPG I've played exclusive to mobile devices (not including emulators, obviously).",positive
Game is awesome but my game keeps crashing in the beginning of every battle and noble phantasm. Can this be fix or no?,positive
great story and characters. horrible gacha rates doe,positive
"The only real reason why this is getting 3 stars is due to the really low quality translation. There are grammatical errors, redundant and confusing sentences.  I was really hyped about this getting an NA release, but despite all the money Aniplex makes from overcharging for all their home releases, they couldn't be bothered to pay a bit more for a well-done localization.",negative
"Play the Japanese version for a while, and I loved it. If it is anything like it's Japanese counterpart then I am sure that you will not be disappointed in this game just as I wasn't.",positive
Won't work on Galaxy S7 edge SM-g935A,neutral
Thanks for translating the game and keep up the good work,positive
Nice! Like the new English version,positive
"I love this game but... It takes forever just trying to do anything, please fix the lag and the drop rate on 5* is ridiculous.",negative
"I have awaited this game to come out in english for a very very lomg time now, and it was well worth the wait boasting graphics and gameplay far beyond what I had anticipated. It can use up a lot of ram with it's high grade content but if your phone can handle it it's very addictive and wonderful for anyone who's a fan of the Fate franchise or are looking for a fun action strategy style game to pick up. The story can be a bit slow as it usually tends to go for phone titles, but overall I am beyond in love with the way it turned out. If it weren't laggy at times for my phone, I would have given it a full 5/5, but it does tend to be a draw back when immersed in beating a boss or grinding a event level. In the future I would also love to see english voice acting as well, though I'm satisfied without it even so.   Tl:dr, great game, minor hang ups, play it if your phone can handle it. Looks great, plays great, girls are cute, and gameplay is very satisfying mechanically and interactively.",positive
About time although I have to restart all over .,neutral
"I can't access the game. Every time I open it, it has me open gmail to email their support team. After receiving a response it turns out that the game won't run if your device is rooted, has dev options on, or has a custom rom. The problem is, I receive the same error even on a completely stock tablet.   These anti-cheater restrictions need to be looked at, because not only are they far harsher than any other game out there, they don't even appear to be functioning properly.",negative
My phone broke shortly after summoning a 5 star and getting the transfer code and now on my new phone it won't let me transfer,negative
"Won't even play on my Samsung galaxy 6, just keep getting an error email, instead of the game even opening.",negative
"Great story, great character's... nuff said",positive
Love it great graphics and a good story,positive
Passable. Engaging story with plenty characters you find yourself loving or hating. Gacha is abysmal though. That alone is almost enough to make me quit. I haven't seen a gacha so horrible since Rune Story. Most of everything else makes up for it though. I love and appreciate the work put into crafting a beautiful story and amazing art. I also wish your choices mattered or held some form of importance. Knowing that choosing either doesn't do anything hurts the game in my opinion. You give the illusion of choice being important when it holds 0 weight.,positive
I would love to play the game but I continue to get the error code 60 when ever I try to play the game. I AM NOT ROOTED NOR DO I HAVE  DEVELOPER OPTIONS ENABLED! I am using a Samsung galaxy s8 on android 7.0. I will properly rate the game once I'm able to play it.,positive
The summon rates are horrible but the story is pretty good. A major recommendation if you are a big fan of the Nasu universe and anime tropes. At the time of the review the translation has bad spelling errors but it's manageable.,positive
Love Fate Grand Order so much hope this game get better and better,positive
So happy to have this in NA!!,positive
Loved the anime series now I love this. Can't wait for there to be more to the game.,positive
"The localization is bad to say the least. The writing is random and often times doesnt seem to understand the character who is speaking or the fate universe. I'll keep playing because it's easier than playing the jp version, but if the translations aren't improved I dont see this version lasting.",negative
"Horrendous 5 star drop rates , don't get too invested in the game or you'll be spending a lot of money, doesn't reward players for spending money either. I understand aniplex is new to release a NA version but the devs have to understand your competing with devs like SUPERCELL and Zeptolab over here. 1$ purchases go a very long way in their games and trying the Japanese model will not be as profitable in NA. Just a heads up, aniplex.",negative
"Amazing gameplay, characters and story. Truly a game worth playing",positive
Looks interesting.  Too bad it just crashes when i try to load it,negative
"Fix your damn game. I and alot of others can't even play because of your stupid root security measure. I do not have a rooted device and it tells me I do. But I don't. Either fix this or lose a lot of players and possible revenue. I expected better, or at least a quick fix.",negative
"Great game so far, having a blast collecting new servants. Some of the  servant designs are too great though.",positive
Need to fix the screen being cut off when typing friend id or anything that requires a numpad as you will only be able to cut and paste or use 123. Other than that you get your type moon fix.,neutral
"So nice to have a NA version, first gatcha i wont mind spending on",positive
Sucks ass cant even open the app get error code 60 but my phone isnt rooted,negative
"Wow, I'm not gonna give it a higher score unless I can play it without data. I have an amazing Wi-Fi signal (143mbps) and it just won't play with Wi-Fi. Fix that, and I'll rate higher because the game itself is promising.",positive
My only problem is the spelling and translation. I mean some of the name are spelled completely wrong. Even English name are spelled wrong and this is an official English localization. Hopefully an update comes out to fix it cause I've been cringing. By the way when I notice owned was spelled onwed on the restore stamina.,negative
"There is quite a lot of meat to this bone. Plenty of content, mechanics to learn, characters to unlock. If you enjoy the Fate series, it's easy to recommend this title.",positive
I love the story so far which is what makes this game so worth playing.,positive
"Good game. However it keeps shutting down on me and the game keeps going up how much data it takes up whenever I play it. It went from a low 85 megabytes to 460 megabytes in just a hour or so of playing, why is it doing that? It was a big hassle to create my character name.",positive
"It is okay, not great, I don't understand the hype. The graphics are alright, art is okay, gameplay is meh, and there is no pvp.",negative
Finally finally finally here in english as a big fate fan I'm more then happy.,positive

Can't run it at all because dev mode is on. Ridiculous. Never seen another game which does that.,negative

"best rpg in smartphone. if u want play it for story, u get it because this game has interesting story other than most of rpg in smartphone. if u want gameplay, this gamr have a more complex team building than most rpg in smartphone. u must count ans think for the skill, cards, and soon. i think u will get the best experience if u play this game a while and not surrender if u get bad gacha. this game is still playable even if u only use *1-*3 cards",positive

"Been playing since the jp version and I couldn't wait for the us release, people complaining about the rates need to understand every gatcha games rates for 5 stars are going to be low, if you don't wana spend money them Don't. I for one don't mind as I enjoy the game for both the story and the mechanics. Yes the translation is a little choppy here and there but they have addressed this and are preparing to adjust most of it. The game isn't for everyone but try it out for yourself, who knows maybe you'll see the enjoyment many players including I find out of this great series.",positive
Pretty Damn good thats all I have to say,positive
"Not a typical mobile phone RPG game, most playable servants come from other Fate series, and so much more later on.",neutral
What a wonderful game!,positive
Simply amazing game not only enjoyable for calm yet fun turnbased gameplay but great detail to story and especially characters and to top it all off fate fans will love all the different servants and their histories that go along with them,positive
This game has a great story line.One of the best I've seen in a while,positive
"A freakin' sick localization of the JP game. The translation varies widely, going from amazing to pretty garbage, but aside from that, it's great. The one thing to note is that the game doesn't support rooted devices, and will crash on startup if you're not running a stock ROM.",positive
"I like everything about the game except the gatcha part. It's easy to learn, fun to play, great character design. Then you have two things you can summon, characters and items to enhance them. Rates are complete garbage and I've summoned more crafting items than actual heroes, do they really think people outside of Japan will spend money on this? I think they took a note from the EA market book, screw over your fanbase for an extra buck. I don't mind spending money on these types of games but why would I risk getting something I cannot use because I have multiple copies of it.",positive

High quality graphic and good story,positive

I cant access the game. I get an error all the time. And send me straight to my email saying the game ia mlnot playable under my playing enviroment. I literally have a friend that plays this game.

People saying the translation is bad are over exaggerating. There are some mistranslations and awkward sentences but nothing important. And by chapter two of the game all the grammar errors disappear,negative
"This game is already amazing even though it just got released, there's already not much that needs to be fixed, great job on this.",positive
Best story in a gacha game,positive

"This is one if the worst translations of a Japanese work I've ever had the displeasure of reading. Not only that, but they cut corners EVERYWHERE in absurdly lazy ways. Not to mention that they didn't adjust the gacha rates at all, making this one of (if not the single most) the worst drop rates for SR and SSR units in America. Hell, the world even. 1% SSR gacha rates is predatory and I've seen many of my friends spend HUNDREDS on the Japanese version without getting a single SSR. Do not give this company your money.",negative
Love it but I played the Japanese version,positive
"English translation is rushed, but good thing I'm japanese",positive
"First off, complaining because you can't get a 5 star when you can re-roll an infinite amount of times is ridiculous. Do the math 1% = 1/100 and no doing 10 pulls of 10 cards doesn't guarantee a 5 star. All gacha games operate on the same platform, it is to be expected. Similarly 40 pulls of 10 doesn't guarantee a thing. That aside I enjoy the combat and chains involved in the game. My favorite servants are Stheno and Elizabeth. I like the storyline and the ascension setup. Looking forward to seeing more servants and leveling up.",negative
"Very fun, particularly for fans of the Fate series. Collecting servants feels great. The only problems I've encountered are occasional issues with the localization. Missing a word, using the wrong form of a verb, etc., but there've only been a dozen or so in the first 8 hours of the game. Ignoring that, the game is loads of fun. As a Fate series fan, seeing all the heroic spirits interacting with each other is wonderful. The questionable personality and gender adjustments of some heroes are perpetually amusing, and the story isn't as bad as the First Order movie made it out to be. Impressive combat system, acceptable story, detailed art. 5/5 for Fate fans.",positive
best salty game ever,positive
The game is amazing since the graphic is just beatiful and smooth.,positive

"Loading... crash... try to multi summon and have to listen to every character you get talk, the enhancing is so drawn out in all these different options and for what? For cash and to eat ram apparently,  the actual gameplay was just like other boring generic games on the store, so yea this game was just hype. Peace.",positive
Omfg thank God,positive
"A great hero lottery style game featuring characters from an already great series. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the frequent crashes. It's early yet, so that may change.",positive
Love the game so far,positive
Basically collect the high star bs storyline is decent but needs a text speed option that is faster than what is there now.,neutral
Don't think of this as an rpg. It's a visual novel with subpar translation. I'm not into visual novels and the rpg aspect is too weak. It's basically impossible to lose. Good if you like story but bad if you're looking for a challenge.,negative
Pretty fun like the turn based combat system.,positive
Game doesn't start and auto crashes into an email. My phone isn't even rooted.,neutral
Sure I have waited for long and sure it is not the best quality but all games starting out is not perfect and I expected the transition from Japanese to English to be rough so I'm still very grateful,positive
"Crashes on launch, HTC 10.",neutral
"In spite of over two years' of waiting, the English release of FGO has done nothing to make the game appeal to fans in the west with its missing content and abysmal gacha rates. That said, we fans were still happy to finally read the story, but currently upon release, the translation is filled with numerous simple grammatical errors from story cutscenes to the menus. Battle dialogue is also without subtitles so I may as well be playing on Japanese servers. Finally, the translation itself is dry and devoid of all the charm and personality of the story and characters while being completely ignorant of the source material. (I.e ""Altria Pendragon"") Aniplex, an industry leader in bringing Japanese content to the west, ought to be held to a much higher standard. When other game localizations have been delivering quality script translations and even with English voice acting on arguably tighter budgets, and when even fan translations are more consistent with series precedent, there's no excuse as an anime fan to accept a shoddy English release.",positive
Perfect score for keeping original Japanese voiceovers. Please don't add English voice acting,positive
Been the Japanese version for awhile now just happy to see it finally in English.,positive
Doesn't work on the LG G4. Kind of disappointing because I was looking forward to play it.,negative
"Love everything about it. What I like about it? ITS NEW, and original. Also the customer support. I couldn't get my game to work so it redirected me to a gmail/mail link. I sent the email. Got a respond in less than 30 mins. The solution worked. So for that I played it. Everything was great about it. It was different. I highly recommend it to people who like the anime and games. :)",positive
"Finally in English. This game is wonderful. More strategic than the other ccg battle games. The story is great, characters are the reason you play though. So many great ones and fully voice by stellar seiyuu",positive
"Never played the jp version or seen anything regarding the series. Oh man this game is fun. Graphics are great, not the bigheaded cartoon types I'm used to. Combat is awesome. Story is great so far. I love it",positive
"This game desperately needs Google's game saves. I want to play this at home and on the go on multiple devices as well, but your account seems limited to one device. Purchasing premium currency seems like too much of a risk until these functions are added. Otherwise, great game!",positive

"What the hell were you guys thinking? Who hired these translators? Can't you guys see the localization is messed up and all over the place? Did you guys half-assed the job? This is the OFFICIAL localozation, not some 14 y.o kid doing their summer homework. I really hope there will be a huge patch to fix the localization.",negative
Neutral right now as I can't play it on my phone. Waiting for it to support the S8+,positive
"Game doesn't work. Odd thing is, the Japanese version works perfectly on this phone...",positive
Shout out to raul A Garcia for telling us how to get the app working. VERY good.,positive
I played the Visual Novle watched the anime and playing the jpn version so 6 out of 5 stars.,positive
"Draconian anti-root protections; even having developer options on in an unrooted device prevents you from playing. I even wiped my phone to try to play but it still didn't work. I'm sick of developers who endlessly block power users from their apps because of the minority who abuse root. Maybe if gacha rates weren't so terrible there would be no need to hack? Anyway as disappointed as I am in the developers, there are plenty of other good games to play that allow rooted users so I wouldn't recommend obsessing over getting it to work.",positive

"Beautiful game, nice graphics. It's like a story with battles, it's great. Games these days have no story and are super boring, but this one is heavy on the story and I love it. Only issue it's the loading times, which are quite long. Since you was just released I'm guessing it will smooth out soon enough though. Good job",positive

"Honest to God the worst rates in any gacha game, could spend 500 dollars and not see even one 1 star..... At least every other gacha has 3-6% and even give you 5 stars after a certain amount of gems used. Well here? You could have 300 acounts summoning and get all 3 stars. Y'all need to fix rates for real, your 1% feels like 0.01 lol... You ruin a perfectly awesome series with being money hungry.",positive

"I'm an OG FGO player who played the game since day one in the Japanese version. I'm very disappointed in the localization quality in the English version. There are misspellings, questionable comma usage, grammar mistakes, etc. The translation is obviously literal and makes Nasu's writing soulless. The fonts used in the UI is inconsistent and not good looking. This whole project just looks rushed.",negative

"Unfortunately the game doesn't like me having USB Debugging turned on. Considering I am a developer, that is a major downside.

"Basically a full feature single player jrpg.  If you enjoy a strong narrative to your gameplay, go for it.  Microtransactions are pretty harsh if you're a completion is, but absolutely unnecessary for a full play through.",positive

Don't bother trying to play if your phone isn't stock. Yet another company is attempting to punish users who desperately want to gain back their phone space by removing bloatware. Save your money.,positive

"Congrats on the launch! First off I think people complaining about the server being down should change their review, they have been up since 9 pm PST and working perfect since. Secondly this game has been working on my phone exactly as well as the JP app has, I'm enjoying the story aside from a couple translation mishaps/choices, but this game is definately very gacha heavy and will drain your battery.",positive
"The graphics was shmeh, the gameplay boring, repetitive, and lackluster. You can't skip any of the battle sequences, I've seen them already. I don't care about how you can dramatically one shot a dinky skeleton. The fact that you can only bring 2 of your own servants to battle is stupid. Oh, and when I closed the app and relaunched, the news letter popped up, blocking my screen, and the exit button is under my home button menu thing. There's so much more to nitpick about this. I was hoping for a replacement for Rage of Bahamut, and I was let.down.",negative

It should be ARTORIA PENDRAGON. It should be Sword of Promised Victory - Excalibur. It should be [all caps] EMIYA. ENDULGED IS NOT A WORD. And you couldn't even bother translating the chants for Noble Phantasms.  I expect the same laziness in regards to My Room lines.,positive
I can't even open the app. It directs me to send an email and tells me that FGO is not playable under my playing environment. I have the latest Android version and should be fine.,positive
"This is the best introduction to the Fate series for someone who isn't afraid of skipping the smoke and mystery usually surrounding the characters, and not sure if they should invest their time. You get to meet a colorful cast of characters, and growing attached to one is rewarding for both gameplay and personal fulfillment. No one in this game is useless, everyone can fill some role, and even the common rarity units have some redeeming quality. The attention to player satisfaction in this free to play game is matched by NO ONE. Overall a well-designed experience, worth my 365 days of playtime on the original server, and some other people have three times that.",positive

"please aniplex, fix the translation and meet the fandom or atleast see their works, see their translation, if possible, hire them. or atleast fix it. this translation is worse than we know from fate material (servant's name like EMIYA as Emiya -_-, i'm fine with altria)  and the one thing u guys must not FORGET. their (servants) behavior, the way they are talking or their words, U MUST TRANSLATE IT CAREFULLY. or, more 2 * for u.",positive
Pokemon is the best,positive
Welcome to salt factory,positive
"It's time to get salted in the summons. Also ignore the retarded idiots who hate the series and fanbase. They are the ones responsible for all the trouble. As they say. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it",negative
"Don't be fooled by the gacha or servant lottery system as it really is a low rate for getting the 5 star servants aside from the annual paid gacha that guarantees it. Story is great, gameplay is simple. This is based from the jpn experience and there will not be much difference from the English aside from the locked servants because of story. Initially the will not be a wide variety but the throne of heroes off type moon has access to essentially it's multiverse.  Best of luck to all new players and again don't get trapped by the gacha.",positive
Been waiting for this,neutral
"Her name is Artoria you morons, listen to people who speak the language you are translating into instead of the idiots that can't.",negative
